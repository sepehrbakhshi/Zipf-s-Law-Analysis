preface
the
ungentle
laws
and
customs
touched
upon
in
this
tale
are
historical
and
the
episodes
which
are
used
to
illustrate
them
are
also
historical
it
is
not
pretended
that
these
laws
and
customs
existed
in
england
in
the
sixth
century
no
it
is
only
pretended
that
inasmuch
as
they
existed
in
the
english
and
other
civilizations
of
far
later
times
it
is
safe
to
consider
that
it
is
no
libel
upon
the
sixth
century
to
suppose
them
to
have
been
in
practice
in
that
day
also
one
is
quite
justified
in
inferring
that
whatever
one
of
these
laws
or
customs
was
lacking
in
that
remote
time
its
place
was
competently
filled
by
a
worse
one
the
question
as
to
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
divine
right
of
kings
is
not
settled
in
this
book
it
was
found
too
difficult
that
the
executive
head
of
a
nation
should
be
a
person
of
lofty
character
and
extraordinary
ability
was
manifest
and
indisputable
that
none
but
the
deity
could
select
that
head
unerringly
was
also
manifest
and
indisputable
that
the
deity
ought
to
make
that
selection
then
was
likewise
manifest
and
indisputable
consequently
that
he
does
make
it
as
claimed
was
an
unavoidable
deduction
i
mean
until
the
author
of
this
book
encountered
the
pompadour
and
lady
castlemaine
and
some
other
executive
heads
of
that
kind
these
were
found
so
difficult
to
work
into
the
scheme
that
it
was
judged
better
to
take
the
other
tack
in
this
book
which
must
be
issued
this
fall
and
then
go
into
training
and
settle
the
question
in
another
book
it
is
of
course
a
thing
which
ought
to
be
settled
and
i
am
not
going
to
have
anything
particular
to
do
next
winter
anyway

1889
a
connecticut
yankee
in
king
arthurs
court
a
word
of
explanation
it
was
in
warwick
castle
that
i
came
across
the
curious
stranger
whom
i
am
going
to
talk
about
he
attracted
me
by
three
things
his
candid
simplicity
his
marvelous
familiarity
with
ancient
armor
and
the
restfulness
of
his
companyfor
he
did
all
the
talking
we
fell
together
as
modest
people
will
in
the
tail
of
the
herd
that
was
being
shown
through
and
he
at
once
began
to
say
things
which
interested
me
as
he
talked
along
softly
pleasantly
flowingly
he
seemed
to
drift
away
imperceptibly
out
of
this
world
and
time
and
into
some
remote
era
and
old
forgotten
country
and
so
he
gradually
wove
such
a
spell
about
me
that
i
seemed
to
move
among
the
specters
and
shadows
and
dust
and
mold
of
a
gray
antiquity
holding
speech
with
a
relic
of
it
exactly
as
i
would
speak
of
my
nearest
personal
friends
or
enemies
or
my
most
familiar
neighbors
he
spoke
of
sir
bedivere
sir
bors
de
ganis
sir
launcelot
of
the
lake
sir
galahad
and
all
the
other
great
names
of
the
table
roundand
how
old
old
unspeakably
old
and
faded
and
dry
and
musty
and
ancient
he
came
to
look
as
he
went
on
presently
he
turned
to
me
and
said
just
as
one
might
speak
of
the
weather
or
any
other
common
matter
you
know
about
transmigration
of
souls
do
you
know
about
transposition
of
epochsand
bodies
i
said
i
had
not
heard
of
it
he
was
so
little
interestedjust
as
when
people
speak
of
the
weatherthat
he
did
not
notice
whether
i
made
him
any
answer
or
not
there
was
half
a
moment
of
silence
immediately
interrupted
by
the
droning
voice
of
the
salaried
cicerone
ancient
hauberk
date
of
the
sixth
century
time
of
king
arthur
and

have

maliciously
by

acquaintance

a
modern
smile
but
one
that
must
have
gone
out
of
general
use
many
many
centuries
agoand
muttered
apparently
to
himself
wit
ye
well
i
saw
it
done
then
after
a
pause
added
i
did
it
myself
by
the
time
i
had
recovered
from
the
electric
surprise
of
this
remark
he
was
gone
all
that
evening
i
sat
by
my
fire
at
the
warwick
arms
steeped
in
a
dream
of
the
olden
time
while
the
rain
beat
upon
the
windows
and
the
wind
roared
about
the
eaves
and
corners
from
time
to
time
i
dipped
into
old
sir
thomas
malorys
enchanting
book
and
fed
at
its
rich
feast
of
prodigies
and
adventures
breathed
in
the
fragrance
of
its
obsolete
names
and
dreamed
again
midnight
being
come
at
length
i
read
another
tale
for
a
nightcapthis
which
here
follows
to
wit
how
sir
launcelot
slew
two
giants
and
made
a
castle
free
anon
withal
came
there
upon
him
two
great
giants
well
armed
all
save
the
heads
with
two
horrible
clubs
in
their
hands
sir
launcelot
put
his
shield
afore
him
and
put
the
stroke
away
of
the
one
giant
and
with
his
sword
he
clave
his
head
asunder
when
his
fellow
saw
that
he
ran
away
as
he
were
wood
demented
for
fear
of
the
horrible
strokes
and
sir
launcelot
after
him
with
all
his
might
and
smote
him
on
the
shoulder
and
clave
him
to
the
middle
then
sir
launcelot
went
into
the
hall
and
there
came
afore
him
three
score
ladies
and
damsels
and
all
kneeled
unto
him
and
thanked
god
and
him
of
their
deliverance
for
sir
said
they
the
most
part
of
us
have
been
here
this
seven
year
their
prisoners
and
we
have
worked
all
manner
of
silk
works
for
our
meat
and
we
are
all
great
gentlewomen
born
and
blessed
be
the
time
knight
that
ever
thou
wert
born
for
thou
hast
done
the
most
worship
that
ever
did
knight
in
the
world
that
will
we
bear
record
and
we
all
pray
you
to
tell
us
your
name
that
we
may
tell
our
friends
who
delivered
us
out
of
prison
fair
damsels
he
said
my
name
is
sir
launcelot
du
lake
and
so
he
departed
from
them
and
betaught
them
unto
god
and
then
he
mounted
upon
his
horse
and
rode
into
many
strange
and
wild
countries
and
through
many
waters
and
valleys
and
evil
was
he
lodged
and
at
the
last
by
fortune
him
happened
against
a
night
to
come
to
a
fair
courtilage
and
therein
he
found
an
old
gentlewoman
that
lodged
him
with
a
goodwill
and
there
he
had
good
cheer
for
him
and
his
horse
and
when
time
was
his
host
brought
him
into
a
fair
garret
over
the
gate
to
his
bed
there
sir
launcelot
unarmed
him
and
set
his
harness
by
him
and
went
to
bed
and
anon
he
fell
on
sleep
so
soon
after
there
came
one
on
horseback
and
knocked
at
the
gate
in
great
haste
and
when
sir
launcelot
heard
this
he
rose
up
and
looked
out
at
the
window
and
saw
by
the
moonlight
three
knights
come
riding
after
that
one
man
and
all
three
lashed
on
him
at
once
with
swords
and
that
one
knight
turned
on
them
knightly
again
and
defended
him
truly
said
sir
launcelot
yonder
one
knight
shall
i
help
for
it
were
shame
for
me
to
see
three
knights
on
one
and
if
he
be
slain
i
am
partner
of
his
death
and
therewith
he
took
his
harness
and
went
out
at
a
window
by
a
sheet
down
to
the
four
knights
and
then
sir
launcelot
said
on
high
turn
you
knights
unto
me
and
leave
your
fighting
with
that
knight
and
then
they
all
three
left
sir
kay
and
turned
unto
sir
launcelot
and
there
began
great
battle
for
they
alight
all
three
and
strake
many
strokes
at
sir
launcelot
and
assailed
him
on
every
side
then
sir
kay
dressed
him
for
to
have
holpen
sir
launcelot
nay
sir
said
he
i
will
none
of
your
help
therefore
as
ye
will
have
my
help
let
me
alone
with
them
sir
kay
for
the
pleasure
of
the
knight
suffered
him
for
to
do
his
will
and
so
stood
aside
and
then
anon
within
six
strokes
sir
launcelot
had
stricken
them
to
the
earth
and
then
they
all
three
cried
sir
knight
we
yield
us
unto
you
as
man
of
might
matchless
as
to
that
said
sir
launcelot
i
will
not
take
your
yielding
unto
me
but
so
that
ye
yield
you
unto
sir
kay
the
seneschal
on
that
covenant
i
will
save
your
lives
and
else
not
fair
knight
said
they
that
were
we
loath
to
do
for
as
for
sir
kay
we
chased
him
hither
and
had
overcome
him
had
ye
not
been
therefore
to
yield
us
unto
him
it
were
no
reason
well
as
to
that
said
sir
launcelot
advise
you
well
for
ye
may
choose
whether
ye
will
die
or
live
for
an
ye
be
yielden
it
shall
be
unto
sir
kay
fair
knight
then
they
said
in
saving
our
lives
we
will
do
as
thou
commandest
us
then
shall
ye
said
sir
launcelot
on
whitsunday
next
coming
go
unto
the
court
of
king
arthur
and
there
shall
ye
yield
you
unto
queen
guenever
and
put
you
all
three
in
her
grace
and
mercy
and
say
that
sir
kay
sent
you
thither
to
be
her
prisoners
on
the
morn
sir
launcelot
arose
early
and
left
sir
kay
sleeping
and
sir
launcelot
took
sir
kays
armor
and
his
shield
and
armed
him
and
so
he
went
to
the
stable
and
took
his
horse
and
took
his
leave
of
his
host
and
so
he
departed
then
soon
after
arose
sir
kay
and
missed
sir
launcelot
and
then
he
espied
that
he
had
his
armor
and
his
horse
now
by
my
faith
i
know
well
that
he
will
grieve
some
of
the
court
of
king
arthur
for
on
him
knights
will
be
bold
and
deem
that
it
is
i
and
that
will
beguile
them
and
because
of
his
armor
and
shield
i
am
sure
i
shall
ride
in
peace
and
then
soon
after
departed
sir
kay
and
thanked
his
host
as
i
laid
the
book
down
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
my
stranger
came
in
i
gave
him
a
pipe
and
a
chair
and
made
him
welcome
i
also
comforted
him
with
a
hot
scotch
whisky
gave
him
another
one
then
still
anotherhoping
always
for
his
story
after
a
fourth
persuader
he
drifted
into
it
himself
in
a
quite
simple
and
natural
way

my
uncle

i
was

during

misunderstanding
conducted
with
crowbars
with
a
fellow

used
to
call
hercules
he
laid
me
out
with
a
crusher
alongside
the
head
that
made
everything
crack
and
seemed
to
spring
every
joint
in
my
skull

made
it
overlap
its
neighbor
then
the
world
went
out
in
darkness
and
i
didnt
feel
anything
more
and
didnt
know
anything
at
all
at
least
for
a
while
when
i
came
to
again
i
was
sitting
under
an
oak
tree
on
the
grass
with
a
whole
beautiful
and
broad
country
landscape
all
to
myselfnearly
not
entirely
for
there
was
a
fellow
on
a
horse
looking
down
at
mea
fellow
fresh
out
of
a
picturebook
he
was
in
oldtime
iron
armor
from
head
to
heel
with
a
helmet
on
his
head
the
shape
of
a
nailkeg
with
slits
in
it
and
he
had
a
shield
and
a
sword
and
a
prodigious
spear
and
his
horse
had
armor
on
too
and
a
steel
horn
projecting
from
his
forehead
and
gorgeous
red
and
green
silk
trappings
that
hung
down
all
around
him
like
a
bedquilt
nearly
to
the
ground
fair
sir
will
ye
just
said
this
fellow
will
i
which
will
ye
try
a
passage
of
arms
for
land
or
lady
or
for
what
are
you
giving
me
i
said
get
along
back
to
your
circus
or
ill
report
you
now
what
does
this
man
do
but
fall
back
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
and
then
come
rushing
at
me
as
hard
as
he
could
tear
with
his
nailkeg
bent
down
nearly
to
his
horses
neck
and
his
long
spear
pointed
straight
ahead
i
saw
he
meant
business
so
i
was
up
the
tree
when
he
arrived
he
allowed
that
i
was
his
property
the
captive
of
his
spear
there
was
argument
on
his
sideand
the
bulk
of
the
advantage
so
i
judged
it
best
to
humor
him
we
fixed
up
an
agreement
whereby
i
was
to
go
with
him
and
he
was
not
to
hurt
me
i
came
down
and
we
started
away
i
walking
by
the
side
of
his
horse
we
marched
comfortably
along
through
glades
and
over
brooks
which
i
could
not
remember
to
have
seen
beforewhich
puzzled
me
and
made
me
wonderand
yet
we
did
not
come
to
any
circus
or
sign
of
a
circus
so
i
gave
up
the
idea
of
a
circus
and
concluded
he
was
from
an
asylum
but
we
never
came
to
an
asylumso
i
was
up
a
stump
as
you
may
say
i
asked
him
how
far
we
were
from
hartford
he
said
he
had
never
heard
of
the
place
which
i
took
to
be
a
lie
but
allowed
it
to
go
at
that
at
the
end
of
an
hour
we
saw
a
faraway
town
sleeping
in
a
valley
by
a
winding
river
and
beyond
it
on
a
hill
a
vast
gray
fortress
with
towers
and
turrets
the
first
i
had
ever
seen
out
of
a
picture
bridgeport
said
i
pointing
camelot
said
he
my
stranger
had
been
showing
signs
of
sleepiness
he
caught
himself
nodding
now
and
smiled
one
of
those
pathetic
obsolete
smiles
of
his
and
said
i
find
i
cant
go
on
but
come
with
me
ive
got
it
all
written
out
and
you
can
read
it
if
you
like
in
his
chamber
he
said
first
i
kept
a
journal
then
by
and
by
after
years
i
took
the
journal
and
turned
it
into
a
book
how
long
ago
that
was
he
handed
me
his
manuscript
and
pointed
out
the
place
where
i
should
begin
begin
hereive
already
told
you
what
goes
before
he
was
steeped
in
drowsiness
by
this
time
as
i
went
out
at
his
door
i
heard
him
murmur
sleepily
give
you
good
den
fair
sir
i
sat
down
by
my
fire
and
examined
my
treasure
the
first
part
of
itthe
great
bulk
of
itwas
parchment
and
yellow
with
age
i
scanned
a
leaf
particularly
and
saw
that
it
was
a
palimpsest
under
the
old
dim
writing
of
the
yankee
historian
appeared
traces
of
a
penmanship
which
was
older
and
dimmer
stilllatin
words
and
sentences
fragments
from
old
monkish
legends
evidently
i
turned
to
the
place
indicated
by
my
stranger
and
began
to
read
as
follows
the
tale
of
the
lost
land
chapter
i
camelot
camelotcamelot
said
i
to
myself
i
dont
seem
to
remember
hearing
of
it
before
name
of
the
asylum
likely
it
was
a
soft
reposeful
summer
landscape
as
lovely
as
a
dream
and
as
lonesome
as
sunday
the
air
was
full
of
the
smell
of
flowers
and
the
buzzing
of
insects
and
the
twittering
of
birds
and
there
were
no
people
no
wagons
there
was
no
stir
of
life
nothing
going
on
the
road
was
mainly
a
winding
path
with
hoofprints
in
it
and
now
and
then
a
faint
trace
of
wheels
on
either
side
in
the
grasswheels
that
apparently
had
a
tire
as
broad
as
ones
hand
presently
a
fair
slip
of
a
girl
about
ten
years
old
with
a
cataract
of
golden
hair
streaming
down
over
her
shoulders
came
along
around
her
head
she
wore
a
hoop
of
flamered
poppies
it
was
as
sweet
an
outfit
as
ever
i
saw
what
there
was
of
it
she
walked
indolently
along
with
a
mind
at
rest
its
peace
reflected
in
her
innocent
face
the
circus
man
paid
no
attention
to
her
didnt
even
seem
to
see
her
and
sheshe
was
no
more
startled
at
his
fantastic
makeup
than
if
she
was
used
to
his
like
every
day
of
her
life
she
was
going
by
as
indifferently
as
she
might
have
gone
by
a
couple
of
cows
but
when
she
happened
to
notice
me
then
there
was
a
change
up
went
her
hands
and
she
was
turned
to
stone
her
mouth
dropped
open
her
eyes
stared
wide
and
timorously
she
was
the
picture
of
astonished
curiosity
touched
with
fear
and
there
she
stood
gazing
in
a
sort
of
stupefied
fascination
till
we
turned
a
corner
of
the
wood
and
were
lost
to
her
view
that
she
should
be
startled
at
me
instead
of
at
the
other
man
was
too
many
for
me
i
couldnt
make
head
or
tail
of
it
and
that
she
should
seem
to
consider
me
a
spectacle
and
totally
overlook
her
own
merits
in
that
respect
was
another
puzzling
thing
and
a
display
of
magnanimity
too
that
was
surprising
in
one
so
young
there
was
food
for
thought
here
i
moved
along
as
one
in
a
dream
as
we
approached
the
town
signs
of
life
began
to
appear
at
intervals
we
passed
a
wretched
cabin
with
a
thatched
roof
and
about
it
small
fields
and
garden
patches
in
an
indifferent
state
of
cultivation
there
were
people
too
brawny
men
with
long
coarse
uncombed
hair
that
hung
down
over
their
faces
and
made
them
look
like
animals
they
and
the
women
as
a
rule
wore
a
coarse
towlinen
robe
that
came
well
below
the
knee
and
a
rude
sort
of
sandal
and
many
wore
an
iron
collar
the
small
boys
and
girls
were
always
naked
but
nobody
seemed
to
know
it
all
of
these
people
stared
at
me
talked
about
me
ran
into
the
huts
and
fetched
out
their
families
to
gape
at
me
but
nobody
ever
noticed
that
other
fellow
except
to
make
him
humble
salutation
and
get
no
response
for
their
pains
in
the
town
were
some
substantial
windowless
houses
of
stone
scattered
among
a
wilderness
of
thatched
cabins
the
streets
were
mere
crooked
alleys
and
unpaved
troops
of
dogs
and
nude
children
played
in
the
sun
and
made
life
and
noise
hogs
roamed
and
rooted
contentedly
about
and
one
of
them
lay
in
a
reeking
wallow
in
the
middle
of
the
main
thoroughfare
and
suckled
her
family
presently
there
was
a
distant
blare
of
military
music
it
came
nearer
still
nearer
and
soon
a
noble
cavalcade
wound
into
view
glorious
with
plumed
helmets
and
flashing
mail
and
flaunting
banners
and
rich
doublets
and
horsecloths
and
gilded
spearheads
and
through
the
muck
and
swine
and
naked
brats
and
joyous
dogs
and
shabby
huts
it
took
its
gallant
way
and
in
its
wake
we
followed
followed
through
one
winding
alley
and
then
anotherand
climbing
always
climbingtill
at
last
we
gained
the
breezy
height
where
the
huge
castle
stood
there
was
an
exchange
of
bugle
blasts
then
a
parley
from
the
walls
where
menatarms
in
hauberk
and
morion
marched
back
and
forth
with
halberd
at
shoulder
under
flapping
banners
with
the
rude
figure
of
a
dragon
displayed
upon
them
and
then
the
great
gates
were
flung
open
the
drawbridge
was
lowered
and
the
head
of
the
cavalcade
swept
forward
under
the
frowning
arches
and
we
following
soon
found
ourselves
in
a
great
paved
court
with
towers
and
turrets
stretching
up
into
the
blue
air
on
all
the
four
sides
and
all
about
us
the
dismount
was
going
on
and
much
greeting
and
ceremony
and
running
to
and
fro
and
a
gay
display
of
moving
and
intermingling
colors
and
an
altogether
pleasant
stir
and
noise
and
confusion
chapter
ii
king
arthurs
court
the
moment
i
got
a
chance
i
slipped
aside
privately
and
touched
an
ancient
common
looking
man
on
the
shoulder
and
said
in
an
insinuating
confidential
way
friend
do
me
a
kindness
do
you
belong
to
the
asylum
or
are
you
just
on
a
visit
or
something
like
that
he
looked
me
over
stupidly
and
said
marry
fair
sir
me
seemeth
that
will
do
i
said
i
reckon
you
are
a
patient
i
moved
away
cogitating
and
at
the
same
time
keeping
an
eye
out
for
any
chance
passenger
in
his
right
mind
that
might
come
along
and
give
me
some
light
i
judged
i
had
found
one
presently
so
i
drew
him
aside
and
said
in
his
ear
if
i
could
see
the
head
keeper
a
minuteonly
just
a
minute
prithee
do
not
let
me
let
you
what
hinder
me
then
if
the
word
please
thee
better
then
he
went
on
to
say
he
was
an
undercook
and
could
not
stop
to
gossip
though
he
would
like
it
another
time
for
it
would
comfort
his
very
liver
to
know
where
i
got
my
clothes
as
he
started
away
he
pointed
and
said
yonder
was
one
who
was
idle
enough
for
my
purpose
and
was
seeking
me
besides
no
doubt
this
was
an
airy
slim
boy
in
shrimpcolored
tights
that
made
him
look
like
a
forked
carrot
the
rest
of
his
gear
was
blue
silk
and
dainty
laces
and
ruffles
and
he
had
long
yellow
curls
and
wore
a
plumed
pink
satin
cap
tilted
complacently
over
his
ear
by
his
look
he
was
goodnatured
by
his
gait
he
was
satisfied
with
himself
he
was
pretty
enough
to
frame
he
arrived
looked
me
over
with
a
smiling
and
impudent
curiosity
said
he
had
come
for
me
and
informed
me
that
he
was
a
page
go
long
i
said
you
aint
more
than
a
paragraph
it
was
pretty
severe
but
i
was
nettled
however
it
never
phazed
him
he
didnt
appear
to
know
he
was
hurt
he
began
to
talk
and
laugh
in
happy
thoughtless
boyish
fashion
as
we
walked
along
and
made
himself
old
friends
with
me
at
once
asked
me
all
sorts
of
questions
about
myself
and
about
my
clothes
but
never
waited
for
an
answeralways
chattered
straight
ahead
as
if
he
didnt
know
he
had
asked
a
question
and
wasnt
expecting
any
reply
until
at
last
he
happened
to
mention
that
he
was
born
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
513
it
made
the
cold
chills
creep
over
me
i
stopped
and
said
a
little
faintly
maybe
i
didnt
hear
you
just
right
say
it
againand
say
it
slow
what
year
was
it
513
513

dont
look

boy

a
stranger
and
friendless
be
honest
and
honorable

me

your
right
mind
he
said
he
was

these
other
people
in
their
right
minds
he
said
they
were
and
this
isnt
an
asylum
i
mean
it
isnt
a
place
where
they
cure
crazy
people
he
said
it
wasnt
well
then
i
said
either
i
am
a
lunatic
or
something
just
as
awful
has
happened
now

me

waited
a
minute
to
let
that
idea
shudder
its
way
home
and
then
said
and
according
to
your
notions
what
year
is
it
now
528nineteenth
of
june
i
felt
a
mournful
sinking
at
the
heart
and
muttered
i
shall
never
see
my
friends
againnever
never
again
they
will
not
be
born
for
more
than
thirteen
hundred
years
yet
i
seemed
to
believe
the
boy
i
didnt
know
why
something
in
me
seemed
to
believe
himmy
consciousness
as
you
may
say
but
my
reason
didnt
my
reason
straightway
began
to
clamor
that
was
natural
i
didnt
know
how
to
go
about
satisfying
it
because
i
knew
that
the
testimony
of
men
wouldnt
servemy
reason
would
say
they
were
lunatics
and
throw
out
their
evidence
but
all
of
a
sudden
i
stumbled
on
the
very
thing
just
by
luck
i
knew
that
the
only
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
in
the
first
half
of
the
sixth
century
occurred
on
the
21st
of
june
ad
528
os
and
began
at
3
minutes
after
12
noon
i
also
knew
that
no
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
was
due
in
what
to
me
was
the
present
yearie
1879
so
if
i
could
keep
my
anxiety
and
curiosity
from
eating
the
heart
out
of
me
for
fortyeight
hours
i
should
then
find
out
for
certain
whether
this
boy
was
telling
me
the
truth
or
not
wherefore
being
a
practical
connecticut
man
i
now
shoved
this
whole
problem
clear
out
of
my
mind
till
its
appointed
day
and
hour
should
come
in
order
that
i
might
turn
all
my
attention
to
the
circumstances
of
the
present
moment
and
be
alert
and
ready
to
make
the
most
out
of
them
that
could
be
made
one
thing
at
a
time
is
my
mottoand
just
play
that
thing
for
all
it
is
worth
even
if
its
only
two
pair
and
a
jack
i
made
up
my
mind
to
two
things
if
it
was
still
the
nineteenth
century
and
i
was
among
lunatics
and
couldnt
get
away
i
would
presently
boss
that
asylum
or
know
the
reason
why
and
if
on
the
other
hand
it
was
really
the
sixth
century
all
right
i
didnt
want
any
softer
thing
i
would
boss
the
whole
country
inside
of
three
months
for
i
judged
i
would
have
the
start
of
the
besteducated
man
in
the
kingdom
by
a
matter
of
thirteen
hundred
years
and
upward
im
not
a
man
to
waste
time
after
my
minds
made
up
and
theres
work
on
hand
so
i
said
to
the
page
now
clarence
my
boyif
that
might
happen
to
be
your
name
ill
get
you
to
post
me
up
a
little
if
you
dont
mind
what
is
the
name
of
that
apparition
that
brought
me
here
my
master
and
thine
that
is
the
good
knight
and
great
lord
sir
kay
the
seneschal
foster
brother
to
our
liege
the
king
very
good
go
on
tell
me
everything
he
made
a
long
story
of
it
but
the
part
that
had
immediate
interest
for
me
was
this
he
said
i
was
sir
kays
prisoner
and
that
in
the
due
course
of
custom
i
would
be
flung
into
a
dungeon
and
left
there
on
scant
commons
until
my
friends
ransomed
meunless
i
chanced
to
rot
first
i
saw
that
the
last
chance
had
the
best
show
but
i
didnt
waste
any
bother
about
that
time
was
too
precious
the
page
said
further
that
dinner
was
about
ended
in
the
great
hall
by
this
time
and
that
as
soon
as
the
sociability
and
the
heavy
drinking
should
begin
sir
kay
would
have
me
in
and
exhibit
me
before
king
arthur
and
his
illustrious
knights
seated
at
the
table
round
and
would
brag
about
his
exploit
in
capturing
me
and
would
probably
exaggerate
the
facts
a
little
but
it
wouldnt
be
good
form
for
me
to
correct
him
and
not
over
safe
either
and
when
i
was
done
being
exhibited
then
ho
for
the
dungeon
but
he
clarence
would
find
a
way
to
come
and
see
me
every
now
and
then
and
cheer
me
up
and
help
me
get
word
to
my
friends
get
word
to
my
friends
i
thanked
him
i
couldnt
do
less
and
about
this
time
a
lackey
came
to
say
i
was
wanted
so
clarence
led
me
in
and
took
me
off
to
one
side
and
sat
down
by
me
well
it
was
a
curious
kind
of
spectacle
and
interesting
it
was
an
immense
place
and
rather
nakedyes
and
full
of
loud
contrasts
it
was
very
very
lofty
so
lofty
that
the
banners
depending
from
the
arched
beams
and
girders
away
up
there
floated
in
a
sort
of
twilight
there
was
a
stonerailed
gallery
at
each
end
high
up
with
musicians
in
the
one
and
women
clothed
in
stunning
colors
in
the
other
the
floor
was
of
big
stone
flags
laid
in
black
and
white
squares
rather
battered
by
age
and
use
and
needing
repair
as
to
ornament
there
wasnt
any
strictly
speaking
though
on
the
walls
hung
some
huge
tapestries
which
were
probably
taxed
as
works
of
art
battlepieces
they
were
with
horses
shaped
like
those
which
children
cut
out
of
paper
or
create
in
gingerbread
with
men
on
them
in
scale
armor
whose
scales
are
represented
by
round
holesso
that
the
mans
coat
looks
as
if
it
had
been
done
with
a
biscuitpunch
there
was
a
fireplace
big
enough
to
camp
in
and
its
projecting
sides
and
hood
of
carved
and
pillared
stonework
had
the
look
of
a
cathedral
door
along
the
walls
stood
menatarms
in
breastplate
and
morion
with
halberds
for
their
only
weapon
rigid
as
statues
and
that
is
what
they
looked
like
in
the
middle
of
this
groined
and
vaulted
public
square
was
an
oaken
table
which
they
called
the
table
round
it
was
as
large
as
a
circus
ring
and
around
it
sat
a
great
company
of
men
dressed
in
such
various
and
splendid
colors
that
it
hurt
ones
eyes
to
look
at
them
they
wore
their
plumed
hats
right
along
except
that
whenever
one
addressed
himself
directly
to
the
king
he
lifted
his
hat
a
trifle
just
as
he
was
beginning
his
remark
mainly
they
were
drinkingfrom
entire
ox
horns
but
a
few
were
still
munching
bread
or
gnawing
beef
bones
there
was
about
an
average
of
two
dogs
to
one
man
and
these
sat
in
expectant
attitudes
till
a
spent
bone
was
flung
to
them
and
then
they
went
for
it
by
brigades
and
divisions
with
a
rush
and
there
ensued
a
fight
which
filled
the
prospect
with
a
tumultuous
chaos
of
plunging
heads
and
bodies
and
flashing
tails
and
the
storm
of
howlings
and
barkings
deafened
all
speech
for
the
time
but
that
was
no
matter
for
the
dogfight
was
always
a
bigger
interest
anyway
the
men
rose
sometimes
to
observe
it
the
better
and
bet
on
it
and
the
ladies
and
the
musicians
stretched
themselves
out
over
their
balusters
with
the
same
object
and
all
broke
into
delighted
ejaculations
from
time
to
time
in
the
end
the
winning
dog
stretched
himself
out
comfortably
with
his
bone
between
his
paws
and
proceeded
to
growl
over
it
and
gnaw
it
and
grease
the
floor
with
it
just
as
fifty
others
were
already
doing
and
the
rest
of
the
court
resumed
their
previous
industries
and
entertainments
as
a
rule
the
speech
and
behavior
of
these
people
were
gracious
and
courtly
and
i
noticed
that
they
were
good
and
serious
listeners
when
anybody
was
telling
anythingi
mean
in
a
dogfightless
interval
and
plainly
too
they
were
a
childlike
and
innocent
lot
telling
lies
of
the
stateliest
pattern
with
a
most
gentle
and
winning
naivety
and
ready
and
willing
to
listen
to
anybody
elses
lie
and
believe
it
too
it
was
hard
to
associate
them
with
anything
cruel
or
dreadful
and
yet
they
dealt
in
tales
of
blood
and
suffering
with
a
guileless
relish
that
made
me
almost
forget
to
shudder
i
was
not
the
only
prisoner
present
there
were
twenty
or
more
poor
devils
many
of
them
were
maimed
hacked
carved
in
a
frightful
way
and
their
hair
their
faces
their
clothing
were
caked
with
black
and
stiffened
drenchings
of
blood
they
were
suffering
sharp
physical
pain
of
course
and
weariness
and
hunger
and
thirst
no
doubt
and
at
least
none
had
given
them
the
comfort
of
a
wash
or
even
the
poor
charity
of
a
lotion
for
their
wounds
yet
you
never
heard
them
utter
a
moan
or
a
groan
or
saw
them
show
any
sign
of
restlessness
or
any
disposition
to
complain
the
thought
was
forced
upon
me
the
rascalsthey
have
served
other
people
so
in
their
day
it
being
their
own
turn
now
they
were
not
expecting
any
better
treatment
than
this
so
their
philosophical
bearing
is
not
an
outcome
of
mental
training
intellectual
fortitude
reasoning
it
is
mere
animal
training
they
are
white
indians
chapter
iii
knights
of
the
table
round
mainly
the
round
table
talk
was
monologuesnarrative
accounts
of
the
adventures
in
which
these
prisoners
were
captured
and
their
friends
and
backers
killed
and
stripped
of
their
steeds
and
armor
as
a
general
thingas
far
as
i
could
make
outthese
murderous
adventures
were
not
forays
undertaken
to
avenge
injuries
nor
to
settle
old
disputes
or
sudden
fallings
out
no
as
a
rule
they
were
simply
duels
between
strangersduels
between
people
who
had
never
even
been
introduced
to
each
other
and
between
whom
existed
no
cause
of
offense
whatever
many
a
time
i
had
seen
a
couple
of
boys
strangers
meet
by
chance
and
say
simultaneously
i
can
lick
you
and
go
at
it
on
the
spot
but
i
had
always
imagined
until
now
that
that
sort
of
thing
belonged
to
children
only
and
was
a
sign
and
mark
of
childhood
but
here
were
these
big
boobies
sticking
to
it
and
taking
pride
in
it
clear
up
into
full
age
and
beyond
yet
there
was
something
very
engaging
about
these
great
simplehearted
creatures
something
attractive
and
lovable
there
did
not
seem
to
be
brains
enough
in
the
entire
nursery
so
to
speak
to
bait
a
fishhook
with
but
you
didnt
seem
to
mind
that
after
a
little
because
you
soon
saw
that
brains
were
not
needed
in
a
society
like
that
and
indeed
would
have
marred
it
hindered
it
spoiled
its
symmetryperhaps
rendered
its
existence
impossible
there
was
a
fine
manliness
observable
in
almost
every
face
and
in
some
a
certain
loftiness
and
sweetness
that
rebuked
your
belittling
criticisms
and
stilled
them
a
most
noble
benignity
and
purity
reposed
in
the
countenance
of
him
they
called
sir
galahad
and
likewise
in
the
kings
also
and
there
was
majesty
and
greatness
in
the
giant
frame
and
high
bearing
of
sir
launcelot
of
the
lake
there
was
presently
an
incident
which
centered
the
general
interest
upon
this
sir
launcelot
at
a
sign
from
a
sort
of
master
of
ceremonies
six
or
eight
of
the
prisoners
rose
and
came
forward
in
a
body
and
knelt
on
the
floor
and
lifted
up
their
hands
toward
the
ladies
gallery
and
begged
the
grace
of
a
word
with
the
queen
the
most
conspicuously
situated
lady
in
that
massed
flowerbed
of
feminine
show
and
finery
inclined
her
head
by
way
of
assent
and
then
the
spokesman
of
the
prisoners
delivered
himself
and
his
fellows
into
her
hands
for
free
pardon
ransom
captivity
or
death
as
she
in
her
good
pleasure
might
elect
and
this
as
he
said
he
was
doing
by
command
of
sir
kay
the
seneschal
whose
prisoners
they
were
he
having
vanquished
them
by
his
single
might
and
prowess
in
sturdy
conflict
in
the
field
surprise
and
astonishment
flashed
from
face
to
face
all
over
the
house
the
queens
gratified
smile
faded
out
at
the
name
of
sir
kay
and
she
looked
disappointed
and
the
page
whispered
in
my
ear
with
an
accent
and
manner
expressive
of
extravagant
derision
sir
kay
forsooth
oh
call
me
pet
names
dearest
call
me
a
marine
in
twice
a
thousand
years
shall
the
unholy
invention
of
man
labor
at
odds
to
beget
the
fellow
to
this
majestic
lie
every
eye
was
fastened
with
severe
inquiry
upon
sir
kay
but
he
was
equal
to
the
occasion
he
got
up
and
played
his
hand
like
a
majorand
took
every
trick
he
said
he
would
state
the
case
exactly
according
to
the
facts
he
would
tell
the
simple
straightforward
tale
without
comment
of
his
own
and
then
said
he
if
ye
find
glory
and
honor
due
ye
will
give
it
unto
him
who
is
the
mightiest
man
of
his
hands
that
ever
bare
shield
or
strake
with
sword
in
the
ranks
of
christian
battleeven
him
that
sitteth
there
and
he
pointed
to
sir
launcelot
ah
he
fetched
them
it
was
a
rattling
good
stroke
then
he
went
on
and
told
how
sir
launcelot
seeking
adventures
some
brief
time
gone
by
killed
seven
giants
at
one
sweep
of
his
sword
and
set
a
hundred
and
fortytwo
captive
maidens
free
and
then
went
further
still
seeking
adventures
and
found
him
sir
kay
fighting
a
desperate
fight
against
nine
foreign
knights
and
straightway
took
the
battle
solely
into
his
own
hands
and
conquered
the
nine
and
that
night
sir
launcelot
rose
quietly
and
dressed
him
in
sir
kays
armor
and
took
sir
kays
horse
and
gat
him
away
into
distant
lands
and
vanquished
sixteen
knights
in
one
pitched
battle
and
thirtyfour
in
another
and
all
these
and
the
former
nine
he
made
to
swear
that
about
whitsuntide
they
would
ride
to
arthurs
court
and
yield
them
to
queen
guenevers
hands
as
captives
of
sir
kay
the
seneschal
spoil
of
his
knightly
prowess
and
now
here
were
these
half
dozen
and
the
rest
would
be
along
as
soon
as
they
might
be
healed
of
their
desperate
wounds
well
it
was
touching
to
see
the
queen
blush
and
smile
and
look
embarrassed
and
happy
and
fling
furtive
glances
at
sir
launcelot
that
would
have
got
him
shot
in
arkansas
to
a
dead
certainty
everybody
praised
the
valor
and
magnanimity
of
sir
launcelot
and
as
for
me
i
was
perfectly
amazed
that
one
man
all
by
himself
should
have
been
able
to
beat
down
and
capture
such
battalions
of
practiced
fighters
i
said
as
much
to
clarence
but
this
mocking
featherhead
only
said
an
sir
kay
had
had
time
to
get
another
skin
of
sour
wine
into
him
ye
had
seen
the
accompt
doubled
i
looked
at
the
boy
in
sorrow
and
as
i
looked
i
saw
the
cloud
of
a
deep
despondency
settle
upon
his
countenance
i
followed
the
direction
of
his
eye
and
saw
that
a
very
old
and
whitebearded
man
clothed
in
a
flowing
black
gown
had
risen
and
was
standing
at
the
table
upon
unsteady
legs
and
feebly
swaying
his
ancient
head
and
surveying
the
company
with
his
watery
and
wandering
eye
the
same
suffering
look
that
was
in
the
pages
face
was
observable
in
all
the
faces
aroundthe
look
of
dumb
creatures

know
that
they
must
endure
and
make
no
moan

we
shall
have
it
again
sighed
the
boy
that
same
old
weary
tale
that
he
hath
told
a
thousand
times
in
the
same
words
and
that
he
will
tell
till
he
dieth

and

singe
him
for
the
weariness
he
worketh
with
his
one
tale
but
that
men
fear
him
for
that
he
hath
the
storms
and
the
lightnings
and
all
the
devils
that
be
in
hell
at
his
beck
and
call
they
would
have
dug
his
entrails
out
these
many
years
ago
to
get
at
that
tale
and
squelch
it
he
telleth
it
always
in
the
third

good

prithee
call

for

the
boy
nestled
himself
upon
my
shoulder
and
pretended
to
go
to
sleep
the
old
man
began
his
tale
and
presently
the
lad
was
asleep
in
reality
so
also
were
the
dogs
and
the
court
the
lackeys
and
the
files
of
menatarms
the
droning
voice
droned
on
a
soft
snoring
arose
on
all
sides
and
supported
it
like
a
deep
and
subdued
accompaniment
of
wind
instruments
some
heads
were
bowed
upon
folded
arms
some
lay
back
with
open
mouths
that
issued
unconscious
music
the
flies
buzzed
and
bit
unmolested
the
rats
swarmed
softly
out
from
a
hundred
holes
and
pattered
about
and
made
themselves
at
home
everywhere
and
one
of
them
sat
up
like
a
squirrel
on
the
kings
head
and
held
a
bit
of
cheese
in
its
hands
and
nibbled
it
and
dribbled
the
crumbs
in
the
kings
face
with
naive
and
impudent
irreverence
it
was
a
tranquil
scene
and
restful
to
the
weary
eye
and
the
jaded
spirit
this
was
the
old
mans
tale
he
said
right
so
the
king
and
merlin
departed
and
went
until
an
hermit
that
was
a
good
man
and
a
great
leech
so
the
hermit
searched
all
his
wounds
and
gave
him
good
salves
so
the
king
was
there
three
days
and
then
were
his
wounds
well
amended
that
he
might
ride
and
go
and
so
departed
and
as
they
rode
arthur
said
i
have
no
sword
no
force
footnote
from
mt
no
matter
said
merlin
hereby
is
a
sword
that
shall
be
yours
and
i
may
so
they
rode
till
they
came
to
a
lake
the
which
was
a
fair
water
and
broad
and
in
the
midst
of
the
lake
arthur
was
ware
of
an
arm
clothed
in
white
samite
that
held
a
fair
sword
in
that
hand
lo
said
merlin
yonder
is
that
sword
that
i
spake
of
with
that
they
saw
a
damsel
going
upon
the
lake
what
damsel
is
that
said
arthur
that
is
the
lady
of
the
lake
said
merlin
and
within
that
lake
is
a
rock
and
therein
is
as
fair
a
place
as
any
on
earth
and
richly
beseen
and
this
damsel
will
come
to
you
anon
and
then
speak
ye
fair
to
her
that
she
will
give
you
that
sword
anon
withal
came
the
damsel
unto
arthur
and
saluted
him
and
he
her
again
damsel
said
arthur
what
sword
is
that
that
yonder
the
arm
holdeth
above
the
water
i
would
it
were
mine
for
i
have
no
sword
sir
arthur
king
said
the
damsel
that
sword
is
mine
and
if
ye
will
give
me
a
gift
when
i
ask
it
you
ye
shall
have
it
by
my
faith
said
arthur
i
will
give
you
what
gift
ye
will
ask
well
said
the
damsel
go
ye
into
yonder
barge
and
row
yourself
to
the
sword
and
take
it
and
the
scabbard
with
you
and
i
will
ask
my
gift
when
i
see
my
time
so
sir
arthur
and
merlin
alight
and
tied
their
horses
to
two
trees
and
so
they
went
into
the
ship
and
when
they
came
to
the
sword
that
the
hand
held
sir
arthur
took
it
up
by
the
handles
and
took
it
with
him
and
the
arm
and
the
hand
went
under
the
water
and
so
they
came
unto
the
land
and
rode
forth
and
then
sir
arthur
saw
a
rich
pavilion
what
signifieth
yonder
pavilion
it
is
the
knights
pavilion
said
merlin
that
ye
fought
with
last
sir
pellinore
but
he
is
out
he
is
not
there
he
hath
ado
with
a
knight
of
yours
that
hight
egglame
and
they
have
fought
together
but
at
the
last
egglame
fled
and
else
he
had
been
dead
and
he
hath
chased
him
even
to
carlion
and
we
shall
meet
with
him
anon
in
the
highway
that
is
well
said
said
arthur
now
have
i
a
sword
now
will
i
wage
battle
with
him
and
be
avenged
on
him
sir
ye
shall
not
so
said
merlin
for
the
knight
is
weary
of
fighting
and
chasing
so
that
ye
shall
have
no
worship
to
have
ado
with
him
also
he
will
not
lightly
be
matched
of
one
knight
living
and
therefore
it
is
my
counsel
let
him
pass
for
he
shall
do
you
good
service
in
short
time
and
his
sons
after
his
days
also
ye
shall
see
that
day
in
short
space
ye
shall
be
right
glad
to
give
him
your
sister
to
wed
when
i
see
him
i
will
do
as
ye
advise
me
said
arthur
then
sir
arthur
looked
on
the
sword
and
liked
it
passing
well
whether
liketh
you
better
said
merlin
the
sword
or
the
scabbard
me
liketh
better
the
sword
said
arthur
ye
are
more
unwise
said
merlin
for
the
scabbard
is
worth
ten
of
the
sword
for
while
ye
have
the
scabbard
upon
you
ye
shall
never
lose
no
blood
be
ye
never
so
sore
wounded
therefore
keep
well
the
scabbard
always
with
you
so
they
rode
into
carlion
and
by
the
way
they
met
with
sir
pellinore
but
merlin
had
done
such
a
craft
that
pellinore
saw
not
arthur
and
he
passed
by
without
any
words
i
marvel
said
arthur
that
the
knight
would
not
speak
sir
said
merlin
he
saw
you
not
for
and
he
had
seen
you
ye
had
not
lightly
departed
so
they
came
unto
carlion
whereof
his
knights
were
passing
glad
and
when
they
heard
of
his
adventures
they
marveled
that
he
would
jeopard
his
person
so
alone
but
all
men
of
worship
said
it
was
merry
to
be
under
such
a
chieftain
that
would
put
his
person
in
adventure
as
other
poor
knights
did
chapter
iv
sir
dinadan
the
humorist
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
quaint
lie
was
most
simply
and
beautifully
told
but
then
i
had
heard
it
only
once
and
that
makes
a
difference
it
was
pleasant
to
the
others
when
it
was
fresh
no
doubt
sir
dinadan
the
humorist
was
the
first
to
awake
and
he
soon
roused
the
rest
with
a
practical
joke
of
a
sufficiently
poor
quality
he
tied
some
metal
mugs
to
a
dogs
tail
and
turned
him
loose
and
he
tore
around
and
around
the
place
in
a
frenzy
of
fright
with
all
the
other
dogs
bellowing
after
him
and
battering
and
crashing
against
everything
that
came
in
their
way
and
making
altogether
a
chaos
of
confusion
and
a
most
deafening
din
and
turmoil
at
which
every
man
and
woman
of
the
multitude
laughed
till
the
tears
flowed
and
some
fell
out
of
their
chairs
and
wallowed
on
the
floor
in
ecstasy
it
was
just
like
so
many
children
sir
dinadan
was
so
proud
of
his
exploit
that
he
could
not
keep
from
telling
over
and
over
again
to
weariness
how
the
immortal
idea
happened
to
occur
to
him
and
as
is
the
way
with
humorists
of
his
breed
he
was
still
laughing
at
it
after
everybody
else
had
got
through
he
was
so
set
up
that
he
concluded
to
make
a
speech
of
course
a
humorous
speech
i
think
i
never
heard
so
many
old
playedout
jokes
strung
together
in
my
life
he
was
worse
than
the
minstrels
worse
than
the
clown
in
the
circus
it
seemed
peculiarly
sad
to
sit
here
thirteen
hundred
years
before
i
was
born
and
listen
again
to
poor
flat
wormeaten
jokes
that
had
given
me
the
dry
gripes
when
i
was
a
boy
thirteen
hundred
years
afterwards
it
about
convinced
me
that
there
isnt
any
such
thing
as
a
new
joke
possible
everybody
laughed
at
these
antiquities
but
then
they
always
do
i
had
noticed
that
centuries
later
however
of
course
the
scoffer
didnt
laughi
mean
the
boy
no
he
scoffed
there
wasnt
anything
he
wouldnt
scoff
at
he
said
the
most
of
sir
dinadans
jokes
were
rotten
and
the
rest
were
petrified
i
said
petrified
was
good
as
i
believed
myself
that
the
only
right
way
to
classify
the
majestic
ages
of
some
of
those
jokes
was
by
geologic
periods
but
that
neat
idea
hit
the
boy
in
a
blank
place
for
geology
hadnt
been
invented
yet
however
i
made
a
note
of
the
remark
and
calculated
to
educate
the
commonwealth
up
to
it
if
i
pulled
through
it
is
no
use
to
throw
a
good
thing
away
merely
because
the
market
isnt
ripe
yet
now
sir
kay
arose
and
began
to
fire
up
on
his
historymill
with
me
for
fuel
it
was
time
for
me
to
feel
serious
and
i
did
sir
kay
told
how
he
had
encountered
me
in
a
far
land
of
barbarians
who
all
wore
the
same
ridiculous
garb
that
i
dida
garb
that
was
a
work
of
enchantment
and
intended
to
make
the
wearer
secure
from
hurt
by
human
hands
however
he
had
nullified
the
force
of
the
enchantment
by
prayer
and
had
killed
my
thirteen
knights
in
a
three
hours
battle
and
taken
me
prisoner
sparing
my
life
in
order
that
so
strange
a
curiosity
as
i
was
might
be
exhibited
to
the
wonder
and
admiration
of
the
king
and
the
court
he
spoke
of
me
all
the
time
in
the
blandest
way
as
this
prodigious
giant
and
this
horrible
skytowering
monster
and
this
tusked
and
taloned
mandevouring
ogre
and
everybody
took
in
all
this
bosh
in
the
naivest
way
and
never
smiled
or
seemed
to
notice
that
there
was
any
discrepancy
between
these
watered
statistics
and
me
he
said
that
in
trying
to
escape
from
him
i
sprang
into
the
top
of
a
tree
two
hundred
cubits
high
at
a
single
bound
but
he
dislodged
me
with
a
stone
the
size
of
a
cow
which
allto
brast
the
most
of
my
bones
and
then
swore
me
to
appear
at
arthurs
court
for
sentence
he
ended
by
condemning
me
to
die
at
noon
on
the
21st
and
was
so
little
concerned
about
it
that
he
stopped
to
yawn
before
he
named
the
date
i
was
in
a
dismal
state
by
this
time
indeed
i
was
hardly
enough
in
my
right
mind
to
keep
the
run
of
a
dispute
that
sprung
up
as
to
how
i
had
better
be
killed
the
possibility
of
the
killing
being
doubted
by
some
because
of
the
enchantment
in
my
clothes
and
yet
it
was
nothing
but
an
ordinary
suit
of
fifteendollar
slopshops
still
i
was
sane
enough
to
notice
this
detail
to
wit
many
of
the
terms
used
in
the
most
matteroffact
way
by
this
great
assemblage
of
the
first
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
land
would
have
made
a
comanche
blush
indelicacy
is
too
mild
a
term
to
convey
the
idea
however
i
had
read
tom
jones
and
roderick
random
and
other
books
of
that
kind
and
knew
that
the
highest
and
first
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
england
had
remained
little
or
no
cleaner
in
their
talk
and
in
the
morals
and
conduct
which
such
talk
implies
clear
up
to
a
hundred
years
ago
in
fact
clear
into
our
own
nineteenth
centuryin
which
century
broadly
speaking
the
earliest
samples
of
the
real
lady
and
real
gentleman
discoverable
in
english
historyor
in
european
history
for
that
mattermay
be
said
to
have
made
their
appearance
suppose
sir
walter
instead
of
putting
the
conversations
into
the
mouths
of
his
characters
had
allowed
the
characters
to
speak
for
themselves
we
should
have
had
talk
from
rebecca
and
ivanhoe
and
the
soft
lady
rowena
which
would
embarrass
a
tramp
in
our
day
however
to
the
unconsciously
indelicate
all
things
are
delicate
king
arthurs
people
were
not
aware
that
they
were
indecent
and
i
had
presence
of
mind
enough
not
to
mention
it
they
were
so
troubled
about
my
enchanted
clothes
that
they
were
mightily
relieved
at
last
when
old
merlin
swept
the
difficulty
away
for
them
with
a
commonsense
hint
he
asked
them
why
they
were
so
dullwhy
didnt
it
occur
to
them
to
strip
me
in
half
a
minute
i
was
as
naked
as
a
pair
of
tongs
and
dear
dear
to
think
of
it
i
was
the
only
embarrassed
person
there
everybody
discussed
me
and
did
it
as
unconcernedly
as
if
i
had
been
a
cabbage
queen
guenever
was
as
naively
interested
as
the
rest
and
said
she
had
never
seen
anybody
with
legs
just
like
mine
before
it
was
the
only
compliment
i
gotif
it
was
a
compliment
finally
i
was
carried
off
in
one
direction
and
my
perilous
clothes
in
another
i
was
shoved
into
a
dark
and
narrow
cell
in
a
dungeon
with
some
scant
remnants
for
dinner
some
moldy
straw
for
a
bed
and
no
end
of
rats
for
company
chapter
v
an
inspiration
i
was
so
tired
that
even
my
fears
were
not
able
to
keep
me
awake
long
when
i
next
came
to
myself
i
seemed
to
have
been
asleep
a
very
long
time
my
first
thought
was
well
what
an
astonishing
dream
ive
had
i
reckon
ive
waked
only
just
in
time
to
keep
from
being
hanged
or
drowned
or
burned
or
something
ill
nap
again
till
the
whistle
blows
and
then
ill
go
down
to
the
arms
factory
and
have
it
out
with
hercules
but
just
then
i
heard
the
harsh
music
of
rusty
chains
and
bolts
a
light
flashed
in
my
eyes
and
that
butterfly
clarence
stood
before
me
i
gasped
with
surprise
my
breath
almost
got
away
from
me
what
i
said
you
here
yet
go
along
with
the
rest
of
the
dream
scatter
but
he
only
laughed
in
his
lighthearted
way
and
fell
to
making
fun
of
my
sorry
plight
all
right
i
said
resignedly
let
the
dream
go
on
im
in
no
hurry
prithee
what
dream
what
dream
why
the
dream
that
i
am
in
arthurs
courta
person
who
never
existed
and
that
i
am
talking
to
you
who
are
nothing
but
a
work
of
the
imagination
oh
la
indeed
and
is
it
a
dream
that
youre
to
be
burned
tomorrow
hohoanswer
me
that
the
shock
that
went
through
me
was
distressing
i
now
began
to
reason
that
my
situation
was
in
the
last
degree
serious
dream
or
no
dream
for
i
knew
by
past
experience
of
the
lifelike
intensity
of
dreams
that
to
be
burned
to
death
even
in
a
dream
would
be
very
far
from
being
a
jest
and
was
a
thing
to
be
avoided
by
any
means
fair
or
foul
that
i
could
contrive
so
i
said
beseechingly
ah
clarence
good
boy
only
friend
ive
gotfor
you
are
my
friend
arent
youdont
fail
me
help
me
to
devise
some
way
of
escaping
from
this
place
now
do
but
hear
thyself
escape
why
man
the
corridors
are
in
guard
and
keep
of
menatarms
no
doubt
no
doubt
but
how
many
clarence
not
many
i
hope
full
a
score
one
may
not
hope
to
escape
after
a
pause
hesitatingly
and
there
be
other
reasonsand
weightier
other
ones
what
are
they
well
they
sayoh
but
i
darent
indeed
darent
why
poor
lad
what
is
the
matter
why
do
you
blench
why
do
you
tremble
so
oh
in
sooth
there
is
need
i
do
want
to
tell
you
but
come

out
theres
a
good
lad
he
hesitated
pulled
one
way
by
desire
the
other
way
by
fear
then
he
stole
to
the
door
and
peeped
out
listening
and
finally
crept
close
to
me
and
put
his
mouth
to
my
ear
and
told
me
his
fearful
news
in
a
whisper
and
with
all
the
cowering
apprehension
of
one
who
was
venturing
upon
awful
ground
and
speaking
of
things
whose
very
mention
might
be
freighted
with
death
merlin
in
his
malice
has
woven
a
spell
about
this
dungeon
and
there
bides
not
the
man
in
these
kingdoms
that
would
be
desperate
enough
to
essay
to
cross
its
lines
with
you
now
god
pity
me
i
have
told
it
ah
be
kind
to
me
be
merciful
to
a
poor
boy
who
means
thee
well
for
an
thou
betray
me
i
am
lost
i
laughed
the
only
really
refreshing
laugh
i
had
had
for
some
time
and
shouted
merlin
has
wrought
a
spell
merlin
forsooth
that
cheap
old
humbug
that
maundering
old
ass
bosh
pure
bosh
the
silliest
bosh
in
the
world
why
it
does
seem
to
me
that
of
all
the
childish
idiotic
chuckleheaded
chickenlivered
superstitions
that
ev
oh
damn
merlin
but
clarence
had
slumped
to
his
knees
before
i
had
half
finished
and
he
was
like
to
go
out
of
his
mind
with
fright
oh
beware
these
are
awful
words
any
moment
these
walls
may
crumble
upon
us
if
you
say
such
things
oh
call
them
back
before
it
is
too
late
now
this
strange
exhibition
gave
me
a
good
idea
and
set
me
to
thinking
if
everybody
about
here
was
so
honestly
and
sincerely
afraid
of
merlins
pretended
magic
as
clarence
was
certainly
a
superior
man
like
me
ought
to
be
shrewd
enough
to
contrive
some
way
to
take
advantage
of
such
a
state
of
things
i
went
on
thinking
and
worked
out
a
plan
then
i
said
get
up
pull
yourself
together
look
me
in
the
eye
do
you
know
why
i
laughed
nobut
for
our
blessed
ladys
sake
do
it
no
more
well
ill
tell
you
why
i
laughed
because
im
a
magician
myself
thou
the
boy
recoiled
a
step
and
caught
his
breath
for
the
thing
hit
him
rather
sudden
but
the
aspect
which
he
took
on
was
very
very
respectful
i
took
quick
note
of
that
it
indicated
that
a
humbug
didnt
need
to
have
a
reputation
in
this
asylum
people
stood
ready
to
take
him
at
his
word
without
that
i
resumed
ive
known
merlin
seven
hundred
years
and
he
seven
hun
dont
interrupt
me
he
has
died
and
come
alive
again
thirteen
times
and
traveled
under
a
new
name
every
time
smith
jones
robinson
jackson
peters
haskins
merlina
new
alias
every
time

turns
up

hundred
years
ago
i
knew
him
in
india
five
hundred
years
agohe
is
always
blethering
around
in
my
way
everywhere
i
go
he
makes
me
tired
he
dont
amount
to
shucks
as
a
magician
knows
some
of
the
old
common
tricks
but
has
never
got
beyond
the
rudiments
and
never
will
he
is
well
enough
for
the
provincesonenight
stands
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
knowbut
dear
me
he
oughtnt
to
set
up
for
an
expertanyway
not
where
theres
a
real
artist
now
look
here
clarence
i
am
going
to
stand
your
friend
right
along
and
in
return
you
must
be
mine
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor
i
want
you
to
get
word
to
the
king
that
i
am
a
magician
myselfand
the
supreme
grand
highyumuckamuck
and
head
of
the
tribe
at
that
and
i
want
him
to
be
made
to
understand
that
i
am
just
quietly
arranging
a
little
calamity
here
that
will
make
the
fur
fly
in
these
realms
if
sir
kays
project
is
carried
out
and
any
harm
comes
to
me
will
you
get
that
to
the
king
for
me
the
poor
boy
was
in
such
a
state
that
he
could
hardly
answer
me
it
was
pitiful
to
see
a
creature
so
terrified
so
unnerved
so
demoralized
but
he
promised
everything
and
on
my
side
he
made
me
promise
over
and
over
again
that
i
would
remain
his
friend
and
never
turn
against
him
or
cast
any
enchantments
upon
him
then
he
worked
his
way
out
staying
himself
with
his
hand
along
the
wall
like
a
sick
person
presently
this
thought
occurred
to
me
how
heedless
i
have
been
when
the
boy
gets
calm
he
will
wonder
why
a
great
magician
like
me
should
have
begged
a
boy
like
him
to
help
me
get
out
of
this
place
he
will
put
this
and
that
together
and
will
see
that
i
am
a
humbug
i
worried
over
that
heedless
blunder
for
an
hour
and
called
myself
a
great
many
hard
names
meantime
but
finally
it
occurred
to
me
all
of
a
sudden
that
these
animals
didnt
reason
that
they
never
put
this
and
that
together
that
all
their
talk
showed
that
they
didnt
know
a
discrepancy
when
they
saw
it
i
was
at
rest
then
but
as
soon
as
one
is
at
rest
in
this
world
off
he
goes
on
something
else
to
worry
about
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
made
another
blunder
i
had
sent
the
boy
off
to
alarm
his
betters
with
a
threati
intending
to
invent
a
calamity
at
my
leisure
now
the
people
who
are
the
readiest
and
eagerest
and
willingest
to
swallow
miracles
are
the
very
ones
who
are
hungriest
to
see
you
perform
them
suppose
i
should
be
called
on
for
a
sample
suppose
i
should
be
asked
to
name
my
calamity
yes
i
had
made
a
blunder
i
ought
to
have
invented
my
calamity
first
what
shall
i
do
what
can
i
say
to
gain
a
little
time
i
was
in
trouble
again
in
the
deepest
kind
of
trouble
theres
a
footsteptheyre
coming
if
i
had
only
just
a
moment
to
think
good
ive
got
it
im
all
right
you
see
it
was
the
eclipse
it
came
into
my
mind
in
the
nick
of
time
how
columbus
or
cortez
or
one
of
those
people
played
an
eclipse
as
a
saving
trump
once
on
some
savages
and
i
saw
my
chance
i
could
play
it
myself
now
and
it
wouldnt
be
any
plagiarism
either
because
i
should
get
it
in
nearly
a
thousand
years
ahead
of
those
parties
clarence
came
in
subdued
distressed
and
said
i
hasted
the
message
to
our
liege
the
king
and
straightway
he
had
me
to
his
presence
he
was
frighted
even
to
the
marrow
and
was
minded
to
give
order
for
your
instant
enlargement
and
that
you
be
clothed
in
fine
raiment
and
lodged
as
befitted
one
so
great
but
then
came
merlin
and
spoiled
all
for
he
persuaded
the
king
that
you
are
mad
and
know
not
whereof
you
speak
and
said
your
threat
is
but
foolishness
and
idle
vaporing
they
disputed
long
but
in
the
end
merlin
scoffing
said
wherefore
hath
he
not
named
his
brave
calamity
verily
it
is
because
he
cannot
this
thrust
did
in
a
most
sudden
sort
close
the
kings
mouth
and
he
could
offer
naught
to
turn
the
argument
and
so
reluctant
and
full
loth
to
do
you
the
discourtesy
he
yet
prayeth
you
to
consider
his
perplexed
case
as
noting
how
the
matter
stands
and
name
the
calamityif
so
be
you
have
determined
the
nature
of
it
and
the
time
of
its
coming
oh
prithee
delay
not
to
delay
at
such
a
time
were
to
double
and
treble
the
perils
that
already
compass
thee
about
oh
be
thou
wisename
the
calamity
i
allowed
silence
to
accumulate
while
i
got
my
impressiveness
together
and
then
said
how
long
have
i
been
shut
up
in
this
hole
ye
were
shut
up
when
yesterday
was
well
spent
it
is
9
of
the
morning
now
no
then
i
have
slept
well
sure
enough
nine
in
the
morning
now
and
yet
it
is
the
very
complexion
of
midnight
to
a
shade
this
is
the
20th
then
the
20thyes
and
i
am
to
be
burned
alive
tomorrow
the
boy
shuddered
at
what
hour
at
high
noon
now
then
i
will
tell
you
what
to
say
i
paused
and
stood
over
that
cowering
lad
a
whole
minute
in
awful
silence
then
in
a
voice
deep
measured
charged
with
doom
i
began
and
rose
by
dramatically
graded
stages
to
my
colossal
climax
which
i
delivered
in
as
sublime
and
noble
a
way
as
ever
i
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
go
back
and
tell
the
king
that
at
that
hour
i
will
smother
the
whole
world
in
the
dead
blackness
of
midnight
i
will
blot
out
the
sun
and
he
shall
never
shine
again
the
fruits
of
the
earth
shall
rot
for
lack
of
light
and
warmth
and
the
peoples
of
the
earth
shall
famish
and
die
to
the
last
man
i
had
to
carry
the
boy
out
myself
he
sunk
into
such
a
collapse
i
handed
him
over
to
the
soldiers
and
went
back
chapter
vi
the
eclipse
in
the
stillness
and
the
darkness
realization
soon
began
to
supplement
knowledge
the
mere
knowledge
of
a
fact
is
pale
but
when
you
come
to
realize
your
fact
it
takes
on
color
it
is
all
the
difference
between
hearing
of
a
man
being
stabbed
to
the
heart
and
seeing
it
done
in
the
stillness
and
the
darkness
the
knowledge
that
i
was
in
deadly
danger
took
to
itself
deeper
and
deeper
meaning
all
the
time
a
something
which
was
realization
crept
inch
by
inch
through
my
veins
and
turned
me
cold
but
it
is
a
blessed
provision
of
nature
that
at
times
like
these
as
soon
as
a
mans
mercury
has
got
down
to
a
certain
point
there
comes
a
revulsion
and
he
rallies
hope
springs
up
and
cheerfulness
along
with
it
and
then
he
is
in
good
shape
to
do
something
for
himself
if
anything
can
be
done
when
my
rally
came
it
came
with
a
bound
i
said
to
myself
that
my
eclipse
would
be
sure
to
save
me
and
make
me
the
greatest
man
in
the
kingdom
besides
and
straightway
my
mercury
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
tube
and
my
solicitudes
all
vanished
i
was
as
happy
a
man
as
there
was
in
the
world
i
was
even
impatient
for
tomorrow
to
come
i
so
wanted
to
gather
in
that
great
triumph
and
be
the
center
of
all
the
nations
wonder
and
reverence
besides
in
a
business
way
it
would
be
the
making
of
me
i
knew
that
meantime
there
was
one
thing
which
had
got
pushed
into
the
background
of
my
mind
that
was
the
halfconviction
that
when
the
nature
of
my
proposed
calamity
should
be
reported
to
those
superstitious
people
it
would
have
such
an
effect
that
they
would
want
to
compromise
so
by
and
by
when
i
heard
footsteps
coming
that
thought
was
recalled
to
me
and
i
said
to
myself
as
sure
as
anything
its
the
compromise
well
if
it
is
good
all
right
i
will
accept
but
if
it
isnt
i
mean
to
stand
my
ground
and
play
my
hand
for
all
it
is
worth
the
door
opened
and
some
menatarms
appeared
the
leader
said
the
stake
is
ready
come
the
stake
the
strength
went
out
of
me
and
i
almost
fell
down
it
is
hard
to
get
ones
breath
at
such
a
time
such
lumps
come
into
ones
throat
and
such
gaspings
but
as
soon
as
i
could
speak
i
said
but
this
is
a
mistakethe
execution
is
tomorrow
order
changed
been
set
forward
a
day
haste
thee
i
was
lost
there
was
no
help
for
me
i
was
dazed
stupefied
i
had
no
command
over
myself
i
only
wandered
purposely
about
like
one
out
of
his
mind
so
the
soldiers
took
hold
of
me
and
pulled
me
along
with
them
out
of
the
cell
and
along
the
maze
of
underground
corridors
and
finally
into
the
fierce
glare
of
daylight
and
the
upper
world
as
we
stepped
into
the
vast
enclosed
court
of
the
castle
i
got
a
shock
for
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
the
stake
standing
in
the
center
and
near
it
the
piled
fagots
and
a
monk
on
all
four
sides
of
the
court
the
seated
multitudes
rose
rank
above
rank
forming
sloping
terraces
that
were
rich
with
color
the
king
and
the
queen
sat
in
their
thrones
the
most
conspicuous
figures
there
of
course
to
note
all
this
occupied
but
a
second
the
next
second
clarence
had
slipped
from
some
place
of
concealment
and
was
pouring
news
into
my
ear
his
eyes
beaming
with
triumph
and
gladness
he
said
tis
through
me
the
change
was
wrought
and
main
hard
have
i
worked
to
do
it
too
but
when
i
revealed
to
them
the
calamity
in
store
and
saw
how
mighty
was
the
terror
it
did
engender
then
saw
i
also
that
this
was
the
time
to
strike
wherefore
i
diligently
pretended
unto
this
and
that
and
the
other
one
that
your
power
against
the
sun
could
not
reach
its
full
until
the
morrow
and
so
if
any
would
save
the
sun
and
the
world
you
must
be
slain
today
while
your
enchantments
are
but
in
the
weaving
and
lack
potency
odsbodikins
it
was
but
a
dull
lie
a
most
indifferent
invention
but
you
should
have
seen
them
seize
it
and
swallow
it
in
the
frenzy
of
their
fright
as
it
were
salvation
sent
from
heaven
and
all
the
while
was
i
laughing
in
my
sleeve
the
one
moment
to
see
them
so
cheaply
deceived
and
glorifying
god
the
next
that
he
was
content
to
let
the
meanest
of
his
creatures
be
his
instrument
to
the
saving
of
thy
life
ah
how
happy
has
the
matter
sped
you
will
not
need
to
do
the
sun
a
real
hurtah
forget
not
that
on
your
soul
forget
it
not
only
make
a
little
darknessonly
the
littlest
little
darkness
mind
and
cease
with
that
it
will
be
sufficient
they
will
see
that
i
spoke
falselybeing
ignorant
as
they
will
fancy
and
with
the
falling
of
the
first
shadow
of
that
darkness
you
shall
see
them
go
mad
with
fear
and
they
will
set
you
free
and
make
you
great
go
to
thy
triumph
now
but
rememberah
good
friend
i
implore
thee
remember
my
supplication
and
do
the
blessed
sun
no
hurt
for
my
sake
thy
true
friend
i
choked
out
some
words
through
my
grief
and
misery
as
much
as
to
say
i
would
spare
the
sun
for
which
the
lads
eyes
paid
me
back
with
such
deep
and
loving
gratitude
that
i
had
not
the
heart
to
tell
him
his
goodhearted
foolishness
had
ruined
me
and
sent
me
to
my
death
as
the
soldiers
assisted
me
across
the
court
the
stillness
was
so
profound
that
if
i
had
been
blindfold
i
should
have
supposed
i
was
in
a
solitude
instead
of
walled
in
by
four
thousand
people
there
was
not
a
movement
perceptible
in
those
masses
of
humanity
they
were
as
rigid
as
stone
images
and
as
pale
and
dread
sat
upon
every
countenance
this
hush
continued
while
i
was
being
chained
to
the
stake
it
still
continued
while
the
fagots
were
carefully
and
tediously
piled
about
my
ankles
my
knees
my
thighs
my
body
then
there
was
a
pause
and
a
deeper
hush
if
possible
and
a
man
knelt
down
at
my
feet
with
a
blazing
torch
the
multitude
strained
forward
gazing
and
parting
slightly
from
their
seats
without
knowing
it
the
monk
raised
his
hands
above
my
head
and
his
eyes
toward
the
blue
sky
and
began
some
words
in
latin
in
this
attitude
he
droned
on
and
on
a
little
while
and
then
stopped
i
waited
two
or
three
moments
then
looked
up
he
was
standing
there
petrified
with
a
common
impulse
the
multitude
rose
slowly
up
and
stared
into
the
sky
i
followed
their
eyes
as
sure
as
guns
there
was
my
eclipse
beginning
the
life
went
boiling
through
my
veins
i
was
a
new
man
the
rim
of
black
spread
slowly
into
the
suns
disk
my
heart
beat
higher
and
higher
and
still
the
assemblage
and
the
priest
stared
into
the
sky
motionless
i
knew
that
this
gaze
would
be
turned
upon
me
next
when
it
was
i
was
ready
i
was
in
one
of
the
most
grand
attitudes
i
ever
struck
with
my
arm
stretched
up
pointing
to
the
sun
it
was
a
noble
effect
you
could
see
the
shudder
sweep
the
mass
like
a
wave
two
shouts
rang
out
one
close
upon
the
heels
of
the
other
apply
the
torch
i
forbid
it
the
one
was
from
merlin
the
other
from
the
king
merlin
started
from
his
placeto
apply
the
torch
himself
i
judged
i
said
stay
where
you
are
if
any
man
moveseven
the
kingbefore
i
give
him
leave
i
will
blast
him
with
thunder
i
will
consume
him
with
lightnings
the
multitude
sank
meekly
into
their
seats
and
i
was
just
expecting
they
would
merlin
hesitated
a
moment
or
two
and
i
was
on
pins
and
needles
during
that
little
while
then
he
sat
down
and
i
took
a
good
breath
for
i
knew
i
was
master
of
the
situation
now
the
king
said
be
merciful
fair
sir
and
essay
no
further
in
this
perilous
matter
lest
disaster
follow
it
was
reported
to
us
that
your
powers
could
not
attain
unto
their
full
strength
until
the
morrow
but
your
majesty
thinks
the
report
may
have
been
a
lie
it
was
a
lie
that
made
an
immense
effect
up
went
appealing
hands
everywhere
and
the
king
was
assailed
with
a
storm
of
supplications
that
i
might
be
bought
off
at
any
price
and
the
calamity
stayed
the
king
was
eager
to
comply
he
said
name
any
terms
reverend
sir
even
to
the
halving
of
my
kingdom
but
banish
this
calamity
spare
the
sun
my
fortune
was
made
i
would
have
taken
him
up
in
a
minute
but
i
couldnt
stop
an
eclipse
the
thing
was
out
of
the
question
so
i
asked
time
to
consider
the
king
said
how
longah
how
long
good
sir
be
merciful
look
it
groweth
darker
moment
by
moment
prithee
how
long
not
long
half
an
hourmaybe
an
hour
there
were
a
thousand
pathetic
protests
but
i
couldnt
shorten
up
any
for
i
couldnt
remember
how
long
a
total
eclipse
lasts
i
was
in
a
puzzled
condition
anyway
and
wanted
to
think
something
was
wrong
about
that
eclipse
and
the
fact
was
very
unsettling
if
this
wasnt
the
one
i
was
after
how
was
i
to
tell
whether
this
was
the
sixth
century
or
nothing
but
a
dream
dear
me
if
i
could
only
prove
it
was
the
latter
here
was
a
glad
new
hope
if
the
boy
was
right
about
the
date
and
this
was
surely
the
20th
it
wasnt
the
sixth
century
i
reached
for
the
monks
sleeve
in
considerable
excitement
and
asked
him
what
day
of
the
month
it
was
hang
him
he
said
it
was
the
twentyfirst
it
made
me
turn
cold
to
hear
him
i
begged
him
not
to
make
any
mistake
about
it
but
he
was
sure
he
knew
it
was
the
21st
so
that
featherheaded
boy
had
botched
things
again
the
time
of
the
day
was
right
for
the
eclipse
i
had
seen
that
for
myself
in
the
beginning
by
the
dial
that
was
near
by
yes
i
was
in
king
arthurs
court
and
i
might
as
well
make
the
most
out
of
it
i
could
the
darkness
was
steadily
growing
the
people
becoming
more
and
more
distressed
i
now
said
i
have
reflected
sir
king
for
a
lesson
i
will
let
this
darkness
proceed
and
spread
night
in
the
world
but
whether
i
blot
out
the
sun
for
good
or
restore
it
shall
rest
with
you
these
are
the
terms
to
wit
you
shall
remain
king
over
all
your
dominions
and
receive
all
the
glories
and
honors
that
belong
to
the
kingship
but
you
shall
appoint
me
your
perpetual
minister
and
executive
and
give
me
for
my
services
one
per
cent
of
such
actual
increase
of
revenue
over
and
above
its
present
amount
as
i
may
succeed
in
creating
for
the
state
if
i
cant
live
on
that
i
shant
ask
anybody
to
give
me
a
lift
is
it
satisfactory
there
was
a
prodigious
roar
of
applause
and
out
of
the
midst
of
it
the
kings
voice
rose
saying
away
with
his
bonds
and
set
him
free
and
do
him
homage
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
for
he
is
become
the
kings
right
hand
is
clothed
with
power
and
authority
and
his
seat
is
upon
the
highest
step
of
the
throne
now
sweep
away
this
creeping
night
and
bring
the
light
and
cheer
again
that
all
the
world
may
bless
thee
but
i
said
that
a
common
man
should
be
shamed
before
the
world
is
nothing
but
it
were
dishonor
to
the
king
if
any
that
saw
his
minister
naked
should
not
also
see
him
delivered
from
his
shame
if
i
might
ask
that
my
clothes
be
brought
again
they
are
not
meet
the
king
broke
in
fetch
raiment
of
another
sort
clothe
him
like
a
prince
my
idea
worked
i
wanted
to
keep
things
as
they
were
till
the
eclipse
was
total
otherwise
they
would
be
trying
again
to
get
me
to
dismiss
the
darkness
and
of
course
i
couldnt
do
it
sending
for
the
clothes
gained
some
delay
but
not
enough
so
i
had
to
make
another
excuse
i
said
it
would
be
but
natural
if
the
king
should
change
his
mind
and
repent
to
some
extent
of
what
he
had
done
under
excitement
therefore
i
would
let
the
darkness
grow
a
while
and
if
at
the
end
of
a
reasonable
time
the
king
had
kept
his
mind
the
same
the
darkness
should
be
dismissed
neither
the
king
nor
anybody
else
was
satisfied
with
that
arrangement
but
i
had
to
stick
to
my
point
it
grew
darker
and
darker
and
blacker
and
blacker
while
i
struggled
with
those
awkward
sixthcentury
clothes
it
got
to
be
pitch
dark
at
last
and
the
multitude
groaned
with
horror
to
feel
the
cold
uncanny
night
breezes
fan
through
the
place
and
see
the
stars
come
out
and
twinkle
in
the
sky
at
last
the
eclipse
was
total
and
i
was
very
glad
of
it
but
everybody
else
was
in
misery
which
was
quite
natural
i
said
the
king
by
his
silence
still
stands
to
the
terms
then
i
lifted
up
my
handsstood
just
so
a
momentthen
i
said
with
the
most
awful
solemnity
let
the
enchantment
dissolve
and
pass
harmless
away
there
was
no
response
for
a
moment
in
that
deep
darkness
and
that
graveyard
hush
but
when
the
silver
rim
of
the
sun
pushed
itself
out
a
moment
or
two
later
the
assemblage
broke
loose
with
a
vast
shout
and
came
pouring
down
like
a
deluge
to
smother
me
with
blessings
and
gratitude
and
clarence
was
not
the
last
of
the
wash
to
be
sure

merlins
tower
inasmuch
as
i
was
now
the
second
personage
in
the
kingdom
as
far
as
political
power
and
authority
were
concerned
much
was
made
of
me
my
raiment
was
of
silks
and
velvets
and
cloth
of
gold
and
by
consequence
was
very
showy
also
uncomfortable
but
habit
would
soon
reconcile
me
to
my
clothes
i
was
aware
of
that
i
was
given
the
choicest
suite
of
apartments
in
the
castle
after
the
kings
they
were
aglow
with
loudcolored
silken
hangings
but
the
stone
floors
had
nothing
but
rushes
on
them
for
a
carpet
and
they
were
misfit
rushes
at
that
being
not
all
of
one
breed
as
for
conveniences
properly
speaking
there
werent
any
i
mean
little
conveniences
it
is
the
little
conveniences
that
make
the
real
comfort
of
life
the
big
oaken
chairs
graced
with
rude
carvings
were
well
enough
but
that
was
the
stopping
place
there
was
no
soap
no
matches
no
lookingglassexcept
a
metal
one
about
as
powerful
as
a
pail
of
water
and
not
a
chromo
i
had
been
used
to
chromos
for
years
and
i
saw
now
that
without
my
suspecting
it
a
passion
for
art
had
got
worked
into
the
fabric
of
my
being
and
was
become
a
part
of
me
it
made
me
homesick
to
look
around
over
this
proud
and
gaudy
but
heartless
barrenness
and
remember
that
in
our
house
in
east
hartford
all
unpretending
as
it
was
you
couldnt
go
into
a
room
but
you
would
find
an
insurancechromo
or
at
least
a
threecolor
godblessourhome
over
the
door
and
in
the
parlor
we
had
nine
but
here
even
in
my
grand
room
of
state
there
wasnt
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
picture
except
a
thing
the
size
of
a
bedquilt
which
was
either
woven
or
knitted
it
had
darned
places
in
it
and
nothing
in
it
was
the
right
color
or
the
right
shape
and
as
for
proportions
even
raphael
himself
couldnt
have
botched
them
more
formidably
after
all
his
practice
on
those
nightmares
they
call
his
celebrated
hampton
court
cartoons
raphael
was
a
bird
we
had
several
of
his
chromos
one
was
his
miraculous
draught
of
fishes
where
he
puts
in
a
miracle
of
his
ownputs
three
men
into
a
canoe
which
wouldnt
have
held
a
dog
without
upsetting
i
always
admired
to
study
rs
art
it
was
so
fresh
and
unconventional
there
wasnt
even
a
bell
or
a
speakingtube
in
the
castle
i
had
a
great
many
servants
and
those
that
were
on
duty
lolled
in
the
anteroom
and
when
i
wanted
one
of
them
i
had
to
go
and
call
for
him
there
was
no
gas
there
were
no
candles
a
bronze
dish
half
full
of
boardinghouse
butter
with
a
blazing
rag
floating
in
it
was
the
thing
that
produced
what
was
regarded
as
light
a
lot
of
these
hung
along
the
walls
and
modified
the
dark
just
toned
it
down
enough
to
make
it
dismal
if
you
went
out
at
night
your
servants
carried
torches
there
were
no
books
pens
paper
or
ink
and
no
glass
in
the
openings
they
believed
to
be
windows
it
is
a
little
thingglass
isuntil
it
is
absent
then
it
becomes
a
big
thing
but
perhaps
the
worst
of
all
was
that
there
wasnt
any
sugar
coffee
tea
or
tobacco
i
saw
that
i
was
just
another
robinson
crusoe
cast
away
on
an
uninhabited
island
with
no
society
but
some
more
or
less
tame
animals
and
if
i
wanted
to
make
life
bearable
i
must
do
as
he
didinvent
contrive
create
reorganize
things
set
brain
and
hand
to
work
and
keep
them
busy
well
that
was
in
my
line
one
thing
troubled
me
along
at
firstthe
immense
interest
which
people
took
in
me
apparently
the
whole
nation
wanted
a
look
at
me
it
soon
transpired
that
the
eclipse
had
scared
the
british
world
almost
to
death
that
while
it
lasted
the
whole
country
from
one
end
to
the
other
was
in
a
pitiable
state
of
panic
and
the
churches
hermitages
and
monkeries
overflowed
with
praying
and
weeping
poor
creatures
who
thought
the
end
of
the
world
was
come
then
had
followed
the
news
that
the
producer
of
this
awful
event
was
a
stranger
a
mighty
magician
at
arthurs
court
that
he
could
have
blown
out
the
sun
like
a
candle
and
was
just
going
to
do
it
when
his
mercy
was
purchased
and
he
then
dissolved
his
enchantments
and
was
now
recognized
and
honored
as
the
man
who
had
by
his
unaided
might
saved
the
globe
from
destruction
and
its
peoples
from
extinction
now
if
you
consider
that
everybody
believed
that
and
not
only
believed
it
but
never
even
dreamed
of
doubting
it
you
will
easily
understand
that
there
was
not
a
person
in
all
britain
that
would
not
have
walked
fifty
miles
to
get
a
sight
of
me
of
course
i
was
all
the
talkall
other
subjects
were
dropped
even
the
king
became
suddenly
a
person
of
minor
interest
and
notoriety
within
twentyfour
hours
the
delegations
began
to
arrive
and
from
that
time
onward
for
a
fortnight
they
kept
coming
the
village
was
crowded
and
all
the
countryside
i
had
to
go
out
a
dozen
times
a
day
and
show
myself
to
these
reverent
and
awestricken
multitudes
it
came
to
be
a
great
burden
as
to
time
and
trouble
but
of
course
it
was
at
the
same
time
compensatingly
agreeable
to
be
so
celebrated
and
such
a
center
of
homage
it
turned
brer
merlin
green
with
envy
and
spite
which
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
but
there
was
one
thing
i
couldnt
understandnobody
had
asked
for
an
autograph
i
spoke
to
clarence
about
it
by
george
i
had
to
explain
to
him
what
it
was
then
he
said
nobody
in
the
country
could
read
or
write
but
a
few
dozen
priests
land
think
of
that
there
was
another
thing
that
troubled
me
a
little
those
multitudes
presently
began
to
agitate
for
another
miracle
that
was
natural
to
be
able
to
carry
back
to
their
far
homes
the
boast
that
they
had
seen
the
man
who
could
command
the
sun
riding
in
the
heavens
and
be
obeyed
would
make
them
great
in
the
eyes
of
their
neighbors
and
envied
by
them
all
but
to
be
able
to
also
say
they
had
seen
him
work
a
miracle
themselveswhy
people
would
come
a
distance
to
see
them
the
pressure
got
to
be
pretty
strong
there
was
going
to
be
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
and
i
knew
the
date
and
hour
but
it
was
too
far
away
two
years
i
would
have
given
a
good
deal
for
license
to
hurry
it
up
and
use
it
now
when
there
was
a
big
market
for
it
it
seemed
a
great
pity
to
have
it
wasted
so
and
come
lagging
along
at
a
time
when
a
body
wouldnt
have
any
use
for
it
as
like
as
not
if
it
had
been
booked
for
only
a
month
away
i
could
have
sold
it
short
but
as
matters
stood
i
couldnt
seem
to
cipher
out
any
way
to
make
it
do
me
any
good
so
i
gave
up
trying
next
clarence
found
that
old
merlin
was
making
himself
busy
on
the
sly
among
those
people
he
was
spreading
a
report
that
i
was
a
humbug
and
that
the
reason
i
didnt
accommodate
the
people
with
a
miracle
was
because
i
couldnt
i
saw
that
i
must
do
something
i
presently
thought
out
a
plan
by
my
authority
as
executive
i
threw
merlin
into
prisonthe
same
cell
i
had
occupied
myself
then
i
gave
public
notice
by
herald
and
trumpet
that
i
should
be
busy
with
affairs
of
state
for
a
fortnight
but
about
the
end
of
that
time
i
would
take
a
moments
leisure
and
blow
up
merlins
stone
tower
by
fires
from
heaven
in
the
meantime
whoso
listened
to
evil
reports
about
me
let
him
beware
furthermore
i
would
perform
but
this
one
miracle
at
this
time
and
no
more
if
it
failed
to
satisfy
and
any
murmured
i
would
turn
the
murmurers
into
horses
and
make
them
useful
quiet
ensued
i
took
clarence
into
my
confidence
to
a
certain
degree
and
we
went
to
work
privately
i
told
him
that
this
was
a
sort
of
miracle
that
required
a
trifle
of
preparation
and
that
it
would
be
sudden
death
to
ever
talk
about
these
preparations
to
anybody
that
made
his
mouth
safe
enough
clandestinely
we
made
a
few
bushels
of
firstrate
blasting
powder
and
i
superintended
my
armorers
while
they
constructed
a
lightningrod
and
some
wires
this
old
stone
tower
was
very
massiveand
rather
ruinous
too
for
it
was
roman
and
four
hundred
years
old
yes
and
handsome
after
a
rude
fashion
and
clothed
with
ivy
from
base
to
summit
as
with
a
shirt
of
scale
mail
it
stood
on
a
lonely
eminence
in
good
view
from
the
castle
and
about
half
a
mile
away
working
by
night
we
stowed
the
powder
in
the
towerdug
stones
out
on
the
inside
and
buried
the
powder
in
the
walls
themselves
which
were
fifteen
feet
thick
at
the
base
we
put
in
a
peck
at
a
time
in
a
dozen
places
we
could
have
blown
up
the
tower
of
london
with
these
charges
when
the
thirteenth
night
was
come
we
put
up
our
lightningrod
bedded
it
in
one
of
the
batches
of
powder
and
ran
wires
from
it
to
the
other
batches
everybody
had
shunned
that
locality
from
the
day
of
my
proclamation
but
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
i
thought
best
to
warn
the
people
through
the
heralds
to
keep
clear
awaya
quarter
of
a
mile
away
then
added
by
command
that
at
some
time
during
the
twentyfour
hours
i
would
consummate
the
miracle
but
would
first
give
a
brief
notice
by
flags
on
the
castle
towers
if
in
the
daytime
by
torchbaskets
in
the
same
places
if
at
night
thundershowers
had
been
tolerably
frequent
of
late
and
i
was
not
much
afraid
of
a
failure
still
i
shouldnt
have
cared
for
a
delay
of
a
day
or
two
i
should
have
explained
that
i
was
busy
with
affairs
of
state
yet
and
the
people
must
wait
of
course
we
had
a
blazing
sunny
dayalmost
the
first
one
without
a
cloud
for
three
weeks
things
always
happen
so
i
kept
secluded
and
watched
the
weather
clarence
dropped
in
from
time
to
time
and
said
the
public
excitement
was
growing
and
growing
all
the
time
and
the
whole
country
filling
up
with
human
masses
as
far
as
one
could
see
from
the
battlements
at
last
the
wind
sprang
up
and
a
cloud
appearedin
the
right
quarter
too
and
just
at
nightfall
for
a
little
while
i
watched
that
distant
cloud
spread
and
blacken
then
i
judged
it
was
time
for
me
to
appear
i
ordered
the
torchbaskets
to
be
lit
and
merlin
liberated
and
sent
to
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
i
ascended
the
parapet
and
there
found
the
king
and
the
court
assembled
and
gazing
off
in
the
darkness
toward
merlins
tower
already
the
darkness
was
so
heavy
that
one
could
not
see
far
these
people
and
the
old
turrets
being
partly
in
deep
shadow
and
partly
in
the
red
glow
from
the
great
torchbaskets
overhead
made
a
good
deal
of
a
picture
merlin
arrived
in
a
gloomy
mood
i
said
you
wanted
to
burn
me
alive
when
i
had
not
done
you
any
harm
and
latterly
you
have
been
trying
to
injure
my
professional
reputation
therefore
i
am
going
to
call
down
fire
and
blow
up
your
tower
but
it
is
only
fair
to
give
you
a
chance
now
if
you
think
you
can
break
my
enchantments
and
ward
off
the
fires
step
to
the
bat
its
your
innings
i
can
fair
sir
and
i
will
doubt
it
not
he
drew
an
imaginary
circle
on
the
stones
of
the
roof
and
burnt
a
pinch
of
powder
in
it
which
sent
up
a
small
cloud
of
aromatic
smoke
whereat
everybody
fell
back
and
began
to
cross
themselves
and
get
uncomfortable
then
he
began
to
mutter
and
make
passes
in
the
air
with
his
hands
he
worked
himself
up
slowly
and
gradually
into
a
sort
of
frenzy
and
got
to
thrashing
around
with
his
arms
like
the
sails
of
a
windmill
by
this
time
the
storm
had
about
reached
us
the
gusts
of
wind
were
flaring
the
torches
and
making
the
shadows
swash
about
the
first
heavy
drops
of
rain
were
falling
the
world
abroad
was
black
as
pitch
the
lightning
began
to
wink
fitfully
of
course
my
rod
would
be
loading
itself
now
in
fact
things
were
imminent
so
i
said
you
have
had
time
enough
i
have
given
you
every
advantage
and
not
interfered
it
is
plain
your
magic
is
weak
it
is
only
fair
that
i
begin
now
i
made
about
three
passes
in
the
air
and
then
there
was
an
awful
crash
and
that
old
tower
leaped
into
the
sky
in
chunks
along
with
a
vast
volcanic
fountain
of
fire
that
turned
night
to
noonday
and
showed
a
thousand
acres
of
human
beings
groveling
on
the
ground
in
a
general
collapse
of
consternation
well
it
rained
mortar
and
masonry
the
rest
of
the
week
this
was
the
report
but
probably
the
facts
would
have
modified
it
it
was
an
effective
miracle
the
great
bothersome
temporary
population
vanished
there
were
a
good
many
thousand
tracks
in
the
mud
the
next
morning
but
they
were
all
outward
bound
if
i
had
advertised
another
miracle
i
couldnt
have
raised
an
audience
with
a
sheriff
merlins
stock
was
flat
the
king
wanted
to
stop
his
wages
he
even
wanted
to
banish
him
but
i
interfered
i
said
he
would
be
useful
to
work
the
weather
and
attend
to
small
matters
like
that
and
i
would
give
him
a
lift
now
and
then
when
his
poor
little
parlormagic
soured
on
him
there
wasnt
a
rag
of
his
tower
left
but
i
had
the
government
rebuild
it
for
him
and
advised
him
to
take
boarders
but
he
was
too
hightoned
for
that
and
as
for
being
grateful
he
never
even
said
thank
you
he
was
a
rather
hard
lot
take
him
how
you
might
but
then
you
couldnt
fairly
expect
a
man
to
be
sweet
that
had
been
set
back
so
chapter
viii
the
boss
to
be
vested
with
enormous
authority
is
a
fine
thing
but
to
have
the
onlooking
world
consent
to
it
is
a
finer
the
tower
episode
solidified
my
power
and
made
it
impregnable
if
any
were
perchance
disposed
to
be
jealous
and
critical
before
that
they
experienced
a
change
of
heart
now
there
was
not
any
one
in
the
kingdom
who
would
have
considered
it
good
judgment
to
meddle
with
my
matters
i
was
fast
getting
adjusted
to
my
situation
and
circumstances
for
a
time
i
used
to
wake
up
mornings
and
smile
at
my
dream
and
listen
for
the
colts
factory
whistle
but
that
sort
of
thing
played
itself
out
gradually
and
at
last
i
was
fully
able
to
realize
that
i
was
actually
living
in
the
sixth
century
and
in
arthurs
court
not
a
lunatic
asylum
after
that
i
was
just
as
much
at
home
in
that
century
as
i
could
have
been
in
any
other
and
as
for
preference
i
wouldnt
have
traded
it
for
the
twentieth
look
at
the
opportunities
here
for
a
man
of
knowledge
brains
pluck
and
enterprise
to
sail
in
and
grow
up
with
the
country
the
grandest
field
that
ever
was
and
all
my
own
not
a
competitor
not
a
man
who
wasnt
a
baby
to
me
in
acquirements
and
capacities
whereas
what
would
i
amount
to
in
the
twentieth
century
i
should
be
foreman
of
a
factory
that
is
about
all
and
could
drag
a
seine
down
street
any
day
and
catch
a
hundred
better
men
than
myself
what
a
jump
i
had
made
i
couldnt
keep
from
thinking
about
it
and
contemplating
it
just
as
one
does
who
has
struck
oil
there
was
nothing
back
of
me
that
could
approach
it
unless
it
might
be
josephs
case
and
josephs
only
approached
it
it
didnt
equal
it
quite
for
it
stands
to
reason
that
as
josephs
splendid
financial
ingenuities
advantaged
nobody
but
the
king
the
general
public
must
have
regarded
him
with
a
good
deal
of
disfavor
whereas
i
had
done
my
entire
public
a
kindness
in
sparing
the
sun
and
was
popular
by
reason
of
it
i
was
no
shadow
of
a
king
i
was
the
substance
the
king
himself
was
the
shadow
my
power
was
colossal
and
it
was
not
a
mere
name
as
such
things
have
generally
been
it
was
the
genuine
article
i
stood
here
at
the
very
spring
and
source
of
the
second
great
period
of
the
worlds
history
and
could
see
the
trickling
stream
of
that
history
gather
and
deepen
and
broaden
and
roll
its
mighty
tides
down
the
far
centuries
and
i
could
note
the
upspringing
of
adventurers
like
myself
in
the
shelter
of
its
long
array
of
thrones
de
montforts
gavestons
mortimers

the
warmaking

and

the
seconds
scepterwielding
drabs
but
nowhere
in
the
procession
was
my
fullsized
fellow
visible
i
was
a
unique
and
glad
to
know
that
that
fact
could
not
be
dislodged
or
challenged
for
thirteen
centuries
and
a
half
for
sure
yes
in
power
i
was
equal
to
the
king
at
the
same
time
there
was
another
power
that
was
a
trifle
stronger
than
both
of
us
put
together
that
was
the
church
i
do
not
wish
to
disguise
that
fact
i
couldnt
if
i
wanted
to
but
never
mind
about
that
now
it
will
show
up
in
its
proper
place
later
on
it
didnt
cause
me
any
trouble
in
the
beginning
at
least
any
of
consequence
well
it
was
a
curious
country
and
full
of
interest
and
the
people
they
were
the
quaintest
and
simplest
and
trustingest
race
why
they
were
nothing
but
rabbits
it
was
pitiful
for
a
person
born
in
a
wholesome
free
atmosphere
to
listen
to
their
humble
and
hearty
outpourings
of
loyalty
toward
their
king
and
church
and
nobility
as
if
they
had
any
more
occasion
to
love
and
honor
king
and
church

a

dear
me
any
kind
of
royalty
howsoever
modified
any
kind
of
aristocracy
howsoever
pruned
is
rightly
an
insult
but
if
you
are
born
and
brought
up
under
that
sort
of
arrangement
you
probably
never
find
it
out
for
yourself
and
dont
believe
it
when
somebody
else
tells
you
it
is
enough
to
make
a
body
ashamed
of
his
race
to
think
of
the
sort
of
froth
that
has
always
occupied
its
thrones
without
shadow
of
right
or
reason
and
the
seventhrate
people
that
have
always
figured
as
its
aristocraciesa
company
of
monarchs
and
nobles
who
as
a
rule
would
have
achieved
only
poverty
and
obscurity
if
left
like
their
betters
to
their
own
exertions
the
most
of
king
arthurs
british
nation
were
slaves
pure
and
simple
and
bore
that
name
and
wore
the
iron
collar
on
their
necks
and
the
rest
were
slaves
in
fact
but
without
the
name
they
imagined
themselves
men
and
freemen
and
called
themselves
so
the
truth
was
the
nation
as
a
body
was
in
the
world
for
one
object
and
one
only
to
grovel
before
king
and
church
and
noble
to
slave
for
them
sweat
blood
for
them
starve
that
they
might
be
fed
work
that
they
might
play
drink
misery
to
the
dregs
that
they
might
be
happy
go
naked
that
they
might
wear
silks
and
jewels
pay
taxes
that
they
might
be
spared
from
paying
them
be
familiar
all
their
lives
with
the
degrading
language
and
postures
of
adulation
that
they
might
walk
in
pride
and
think
themselves
the
gods
of
this
world
and
for
all
this
the
thanks
they
got
were
cuffs
and
contempt
and
so
poorspirited
were
they
that
they
took
even
this
sort
of
attention
as
an
honor
inherited
ideas
are
a
curious
thing
and
interesting
to
observe
and
examine
i
had
mine
the
king
and
his
people
had
theirs
in
both
cases
they
flowed
in
ruts
worn
deep
by
time
and
habit
and
the
man
who
should
have
proposed
to
divert
them
by
reason
and
argument
would
have
had
a
long
contract
on
his
hands
for
instance
those
people
had
inherited
the
idea
that
all
men
without
title
and
a
long
pedigree
whether
they
had
great
natural
gifts
and
acquirements
or
hadnt
were
creatures
of
no
more
consideration
than
so
many
animals
bugs
insects
whereas
i
had
inherited
the
idea
that
human
daws
who
can
consent
to
masquerade
in
the
peacockshams
of
inherited
dignities
and
unearned
titles
are
of
no
good
but
to
be
laughed
at
the
way
i
was
looked
upon
was
odd
but
it
was
natural
you
know
how
the
keeper
and
the
public
regard
the
elephant
in
the
menagerie
well
that
is
the
idea
they
are
full
of
admiration
of
his
vast
bulk
and
his
prodigious
strength
they
speak
with
pride
of
the
fact
that
he
can
do
a
hundred
marvels
which
are
far
and
away
beyond
their
own
powers
and
they
speak
with
the
same
pride
of
the
fact
that
in
his
wrath
he
is
able
to
drive
a
thousand
men
before
him
but
does
that
make
him
one
of
them
no
the
raggedest
tramp
in
the
pit
would
smile
at
the
idea
he
couldnt
comprehend
it
couldnt
take
it
in
couldnt
in
any
remote
way
conceive
of
it
well
to
the
king
the
nobles
and
all
the
nation
down
to
the
very
slaves
and
tramps
i
was
just
that
kind
of
an
elephant
and
nothing
more
i
was
admired
also
feared
but
it
was
as
an
animal
is
admired
and
feared
the
animal
is
not
reverenced
neither
was
i
i
was
not
even
respected
i
had
no
pedigree
no
inherited
title
so
in
the
kings
and
nobles
eyes
i
was
mere
dirt
the
people
regarded
me
with
wonder
and
awe
but
there
was
no
reverence
mixed
with
it
through
the
force
of
inherited
ideas
they
were
not
able
to
conceive
of
anything
being
entitled
to
that
except
pedigree
and
lordship
there
you
see
the
hand
of
that
awful
power
the
roman
catholic
church
in
two
or
three
little
centuries
it
had
converted
a
nation
of
men
to
a
nation
of
worms
before
the
day
of
the
churchs
supremacy
in
the
world
men
were
men
and
held
their
heads
up
and
had
a
mans
pride
and
spirit
and
independence
and
what
of
greatness
and
position
a
person
got
he
got
mainly
by
achievement
not
by
birth
but
then
the
church
came
to
the
front
with
an
axe
to
grind
and
she
was
wise
subtle
and
knew
more
than
one
way
to
skin
a
cator
a
nation
she
invented
divine
right
of
kings
and
propped
it
all
around
brick
by
brick
with
the
beatitudes
wrenching
them
from
their
good
purpose
to
make
them
fortify
an
evil
one
she
preached
to
the
commoner
humility
obedience
to
superiors
the
beauty
of
selfsacrifice
she
preached
to
the
commoner
meekness
under
insult
preached
still
to
the
commoner
always
to
the
commoner
patience
meanness
of
spirit
nonresistance
under
oppression
and
she
introduced
heritable
ranks
and
aristocracies
and
taught
all
the
christian
populations
of
the
earth
to
bow
down
to
them
and
worship
them
even
down
to
my
birthcentury
that
poison
was
still
in
the
blood
of
christendom
and
the
best
of
english
commoners
was
still
content
to
see
his
inferiors
impudently
continuing
to
hold
a
number
of
positions
such
as
lordships
and
the
throne
to
which
the
grotesque
laws
of
his
country
did
not
allow
him
to
aspire
in
fact
he
was
not
merely
contented
with
this
strange
condition
of
things
he
was
even
able
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
proud
of
it
it
seems
to
show
that
there
isnt
anything
you
cant
stand
if
you
are
only
born
and
bred
to
it
of
course
that
taint
that
reverence
for
rank
and
title
had
been
in
our
american
blood
tooi
know
that
but
when
i
left
america
it
had
disappearedat
least
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
remnant
of
it
was
restricted
to
the
dudes
and
dudesses
when
a
disease
has
worked
its
way
down
to
that
level
it
may
fairly
be
said
to
be
out
of
the
system
but
to
return
to
my
anomalous
position
in
king
arthurs
kingdom
here
i
was
a
giant
among
pigmies
a
man
among
children
a
master
intelligence
among
intellectual
moles
by
all
rational
measurement
the
one
and
only
actually
great
man
in
that
whole
british
world
and
yet
there
and
then
just
as
in
the
remote
england
of
my
birthtime
the
sheepwitted
earl
who
could
claim
long
descent
from
a
kings
leman
acquired
at
secondhand
from
the
slums
of
london
was
a
better
man
than
i
was
such
a
personage
was
fawned
upon
in
arthurs
realm
and
reverently
looked
up
to
by
everybody
even
though
his
dispositions
were
as
mean
as
his
intelligence
and
his
morals
as
base
as
his
lineage
there
were
times
when
he
could
sit
down
in
the
kings
presence
but
i
couldnt
i
could
have
got
a
title
easily
enough
and
that
would
have
raised
me
a
large
step
in
everybodys
eyes
even
in
the
kings
the
giver
of
it
but
i
didnt
ask
for
it
and
i
declined
it
when
it
was
offered
i
couldnt
have
enjoyed
such
a
thing
with
my
notions
and
it
wouldnt
have
been
fair
anyway
because
as
far
back
as
i
could
go
our
tribe
had
always
been
short
of
the
bar
sinister
i
couldnt
have
felt
really
and
satisfactorily
fine
and
proud
and
setup
over
any
title
except
one
that
should
come
from
the
nation
itself
the
only
legitimate
source
and
such
an
one
i
hoped
to
win
and
in
the
course
of
years
of
honest
and
honorable
endeavor
i
did
win
it
and
did
wear
it
with
a
high
and
clean
pride
this
title
fell
casually
from
the
lips
of
a
blacksmith
one
day
in
a
village
was
caught
up
as
a
happy
thought
and
tossed
from
mouth
to
mouth
with
a
laugh
and
an
affirmative
vote
in
ten
days
it
had
swept
the
kingdom
and
was
become
as
familiar
as
the
kings
name
i
was
never
known
by
any
other
designation
afterward
whether
in
the
nations
talk
or
in
grave
debate
upon
matters
of
state
at
the
councilboard
of
the
sovereign
this
title
translated
into
modern
speech
would
be
the
boss
elected
by
the
nation
that
suited
me
and
it
was
a
pretty
high
title
there
were
very
few
thes
and
i
was
one
of
them
if
you
spoke
of
the
duke
or
the
earl
or
the
bishop
how
could
anybody
tell
which
one
you
meant
but
if
you
spoke
of
the
king
or
the
queen
or
the
boss
it
was
different
well
i
liked
the
king
and
as
king
i
respected
himrespected
the
office
at
least
respected
it
as
much
as
i
was
capable
of
respecting
any
unearned
supremacy
but
as
men
i
looked
down
upon
him
and
his
noblesprivately
and
he
and
they
liked
me
and
respected
my
office
but
as
an
animal
without
birth
or
sham
title
they
looked
down
upon
meand
were
not
particularly
private
about
it
either
i
didnt
charge
for
my
opinion
about
them
and
they
didnt
charge
for
their
opinion
about
me
the
account
was
square
the
books
balanced
everybody
was
satisfied
chapter
ix
the
tournament
they
were
always
having
grand
tournaments
there
at
camelot
and
very
stirring
and
picturesque
and
ridiculous
human
bullfights
they
were
too
but
just
a
little
wearisome
to
the
practical
mind
however
i
was
generally
on
handfor
two
reasons
a
man
must
not
hold
himself
aloof
from
the
things
which
his
friends
and
his
community
have
at
heart
if
he
would
be
likedespecially
as
a
statesman
and
both
as
business
man
and
statesman
i
wanted
to
study
the
tournament
and
see
if
i
couldnt
invent
an
improvement
on
it
that
reminds
me
to
remark
in
passing
that
the
very
first
official
thing
i
did
in
my
administrationand
it
was
on
the
very
first
day
of
it
toowas
to
start
a
patent
office
for
i
knew
that
a
country
without
a
patent
office
and
good
patent
laws
was
just
a
crab
and
couldnt
travel
any
way
but
sideways
or
backways
things
ran
along
a
tournament
nearly
every
week
and
now
and
then
the
boys
used
to
want
me
to
take
a
handi
mean
sir
launcelot
and
the
restbut
i
said
i
would
by
and
by
no
hurry
yet
and
too
much
government
machinery
to
oil
up
and
set
to
rights
and
start
agoing
we
had
one
tournament
which
was
continued
from
day
to
day
during
more
than
a
week
and
as
many
as
five
hundred
knights
took
part
in
it
from
first
to
last
they
were
weeks
gathering
they
came
on
horseback
from
everywhere
from
the
very
ends
of
the
country
and
even
from
beyond
the
sea
and
many
brought
ladies
and
all
brought
squires
and
troops
of
servants
it
was
a
most
gaudy
and
gorgeous
crowd
as
to
costumery
and
very
characteristic
of
the
country
and
the
time
in
the
way
of
high
animal
spirits
innocent
indecencies
of
language
and
happyhearted
indifference
to
morals
it
was
fight
or
look
on
all
day
and
every
day
and
sing
gamble
dance
carouse
half
the
night
every
night
they
had
a
most
noble
good
time
you
never
saw
such
people
those
banks
of
beautiful
ladies
shining
in
their
barbaric
splendors
would
see
a
knight
sprawl
from
his
horse
in
the
lists
with
a
lanceshaft
the
thickness
of
your
ankle
clean
through
him
and
the
blood
spouting
and
instead
of
fainting
they
would
clap
their
hands
and
crowd
each
other
for
a
better
view
only
sometimes
one
would
dive
into
her
handkerchief
and
look
ostentatiously
brokenhearted
and
then
you
could
lay
two
to
one
that
there
was
a
scandal
there
somewhere
and
she
was
afraid
the
public
hadnt
found
it
out
the
noise
at
night
would
have
been
annoying
to
me
ordinarily
but
i
didnt
mind
it
in
the
present
circumstances
because
it
kept
me
from
hearing
the
quacks
detaching
legs
and
arms
from
the
days
cripples
they
ruined
an
uncommon
good
old
crosscut
saw
for
me
and
broke
the
sawbuck
too
but
i
let
it
pass
and
as
for
my
axewell
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
next
time
i
lent
an
axe
to
a
surgeon
i
would
pick
my
century
i
not
only
watched
this
tournament
from
day
to
day
but
detailed
an
intelligent
priest
from
my
department
of
public
morals
and
agriculture
and
ordered
him
to
report
it
for
it
was
my
purpose
by
and
by
when
i
should
have
gotten
the
people
along
far
enough
to
start
a
newspaper
the
first
thing
you
want
in
a
new
country
is
a
patent
office
then
work
up
your
school
system
and
after
that
out
with
your
paper
a
newspaper
has
its
faults
and
plenty
of
them
but
no
matter
its
hark
from
the
tomb
for
a
dead
nation
and
dont
you
forget
it
you
cant
resurrect
a
dead
nation
without
it
there
isnt
any
way
so
i
wanted
to
sample
things
and
be
finding
out
what
sort
of
reportermaterial
i
might
be
able
to
rake
together
out
of
the
sixth
century
when
i
should
come
to
need
it
well
the
priest
did
very
well
considering
he
got
in
all
the
details
and
that
is
a
good
thing
in
a
local
item
you
see
he
had
kept
books
for
the
undertakerdepartment
of
his
church
when
he
was
younger
and
there
you
know
the
moneys
in
the
details
the
more
details
the
more
swag
bearers
mutes
candles
prayers
everything
counts
and
if
the
bereaved
dont
buy
prayers
enough
you
mark
up
your
candles
with
a
forked
pencil
and
your
bill
shows
up
all
right
and
he
had
a
good
knack
at
getting
in
the
complimentary
thing
here
and
there
about
a
knight
that
was
likely
to
advertiseno
i
mean
a
knight
that
had
influence
and
he
also
had
a
neat
gift
of
exaggeration
for
in
his
time
he
had
kept
door
for
a
pious
hermit
who
lived
in
a
sty
and
worked
miracles
of
course
this
novices
report
lacked
whoop
and
crash
and
lurid
description
and
therefore
wanted
the
true
ring
but
its
antique
wording
was
quaint
and
sweet
and
simple
and
full
of
the
fragrances
and
flavors
of
the
time
and
these
little
merits
made
up
in
a
measure
for
its
more
important
lacks
here
is
an
extract
from
it
then
sir
brian
de
les
isles
and
grummore
grummorsum
knights
of
the
castle
encountered
with
sir
aglovale
and
sir
tor
and
sir
tor
smote
down
sir
grummore
grummorsum
to
the
earth
then
came
sir
carados
of
the
dolorous
tower
and
sir
turquine
knights
of
the
castle
and
there
encountered
with
them
sir
percivale
de
galis
and
sir
lamorak
de
galis
that
were
two
brethren
and
there
encountered
sir
percivale
with
sir
carados
and
either
brake
their
spears
unto
their
hands
and
then
sir
turquine
with
sir
lamorak
and
either
of
them
smote
down
other
horse
and
all
to
the
earth
and
either
parties
rescued
other
and
horsed
them
again
and
sir
arnold
and
sir
gauter
knights
of
the
castle
encountered
with
sir
brandiles
and
sir
kay
and
these
four
knights
encountered
mightily
and
brake
their
spears
to
their
hands
then
came
sir
pertolope
from
the
castle
and
there
encountered
with
him
sir
lionel
and
there
sir
pertolope
the
green
knight
smote
down
sir
lionel
brother
to
sir
launcelot
all
this
was
marked
by
noble
heralds
who
bare
him
best
and
their
names
then
sir
bleobaris
brake
his
spear
upon
sir
gareth
but
of
that
stroke
sir
bleobaris
fell
to
the
earth
when
sir
galihodin
saw
that
he
bad
sir
gareth
keep
him
and
sir
gareth
smote
him
to
the
earth
then
sir
galihud
gat
a
spear
to
avenge
his
brother
and
in
the
same
wise
sir
gareth
served
him
and
sir
dinadan
and
his
brother
la
cote
male
taile
and
sir
sagramore
le
disirous
and
sir
dodinas
le
savage
all
these
he
bare
down
with
one
spear
when
king
aswisance
of
ireland
saw
sir
gareth
fare
so
he
marvelled
what
he
might
be
that
one
time
seemed
green
and
another
time
at
his
again
coming
he
seemed
blue
and
thus
at
every
course
that
he
rode
to
and
fro
he
changed
his
color
so
that
there
might
neither
king
nor
knight
have
ready
cognizance
of
him
then
sir
agwisance
the
king
of
ireland
encountered
with
sir
gareth
and
there
sir
gareth
smote
him
from
his
horse
saddle
and
all
and
then
came
king
carados
of
scotland
and
sir
gareth
smote
him
down
horse
and
man
and
in
the
same
wise
he
served
king
uriens
of
the
land
of
gore
and
then
there
came
in
sir
bagdemagus
and
sir
gareth
smote
him
down
horse
and
man
to
the
earth
and
bagdemaguss
son
meliganus
brake
a
spear
upon
sir
gareth
mightily
and
knightly
and
then
sir
galahault
the
noble
prince
cried
on
high
knight
with
the
many
colors
well
hast
thou
justed
now
make
thee
ready
that
i
may
just
with
thee
sir
gareth
heard
him
and
he
gat
a
great
spear
and
so
they
encountered
together
and
there
the
prince
brake
his
spear
but
sir
gareth
smote
him
upon
the
left
side
of
the
helm
that
he
reeled
here
and
there
and
he
had
fallen
down
had
not
his
men
recovered
him
truly
said
king
arthur
that
knight
with
the
many
colors
is
a
good
knight
wherefore
the
king
called
unto
him
sir
launcelot
and
prayed
him
to
encounter
with
that
knight
sir
said
launcelot
i
may
as
well
find
in
my
heart
for
to
forbear
him
at
this
time
for
he
hath
had
travail
enough
this
day
and
when
a
good
knight
doth
so
well
upon
some
day
it
is
no
good
knights
part
to
let
him
of
his
worship
and
namely
when
he
seeth
a
knight
hath
done
so
great
labour
for
peradventure
said
sir
launcelot
his
quarrel
is
here
this
day
and
peradventure
he
is
best
beloved
with
this
lady
of
all
that
be
here
for
i
see
well
he
paineth
himself
and
enforceth
him
to
do
great
deeds
and
therefore
said
sir
launcelot
as
for
me
this
day
he
shall
have
the
honour
though
it
lay
in
my
power
to
put
him
from
it
i
would
not
there
was
an
unpleasant
little
episode
that
day
which
for
reasons
of
state
i
struck
out
of
my
priests
report
you
will
have
noticed
that
garry
was
doing
some
great
fighting
in
the
engagement
when
i
say
garry
i
mean
sir
gareth
garry
was
my
private
pet
name
for
him
it
suggests
that
i
had
a
deep
affection
for
him
and
that
was
the
case
but
it
was
a
private
pet
name
only
and
never
spoken
aloud
to
any
one
much
less
to
him
being
a
noble
he
would
not
have
endured
a
familiarity
like
that
from
me
well
to
proceed
i
sat
in
the
private
box
set
apart
for
me
as
the
kings
minister
while
sir
dinadan
was
waiting
for
his
turn
to
enter
the
lists
he
came
in
there
and
sat
down
and
began
to
talk
for
he
was
always
making
up
to
me
because
i
was
a
stranger
and
he
liked
to
have
a
fresh
market
for
his
jokes
the
most
of
them
having
reached
that
stage
of
wear
where
the
teller
has
to
do
the
laughing
himself
while
the
other
person
looks
sick
i
had
always
responded
to
his
efforts
as
well
as
i
could
and
felt
a
very
deep
and
real
kindness
for
him
too
for
the
reason
that
if
by
malice
of
fate
he
knew
the
one
particular
anecdote
which
i
had
heard
oftenest
and
had
most
hated
and
most
loathed
all
my
life
he
had
at
least
spared
it
me
it
was
one
which
i
had
heard
attributed
to
every
humorous
person
who
had
ever
stood
on
american
soil
from
columbus
down
to
artemus
ward
it
was
about
a
humorous
lecturer
who
flooded
an
ignorant
audience
with
the
killingest
jokes
for
an
hour
and
never
got
a
laugh
and
then
when
he
was
leaving
some
gray
simpletons
wrung
him
gratefully
by
the
hand
and
said
it
had
been
the
funniest
thing
they
had
ever
heard
and
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
keep
from
laughin
right
out
in
meetin
that
anecdote
never
saw
the
day
that
it
was
worth
the
telling
and
yet
i
had
sat
under
the
telling
of
it
hundreds
and
thousands
and
millions
and
billions
of
times
and
cried
and
cursed
all
the
way
through
then
who
can
hope
to
know
what
my
feelings
were
to
hear
this
armorplated
ass
start
in
on
it
again
in
the
murky
twilight
of
tradition
before
the
dawn
of
history
while
even
lactantius
might
be
referred
to
as
the
late
lactantius
and
the
crusades
wouldnt
be
born
for
five
hundred
years
yet
just
as
he
finished
the
callboy
came
so
hawhawing
like
a
demon
he
went
rattling
and
clanking
out
like
a
crate
of
loose
castings
and
i
knew
nothing
more
it
was
some
minutes
before
i
came
to
and
then
i
opened
my
eyes
just
in
time
to
see
sir
gareth
fetch
him
an
awful
welt
and
i
unconsciously
out
with
the
prayer
i
hope
to
gracious
hes
killed
but
by
illluck
before
i
had
got
half
through
with
the
words
sir
gareth
crashed
into
sir
sagramor
le
desirous
and
sent
him
thundering
over
his
horses
crupper
and
sir
sagramor
caught
my
remark
and
thought
i
meant
it
for
him
well
whenever
one
of
those
people
got
a
thing
into
his
head
there
was
no
getting
it
out
again
i
knew
that
so
i
saved
my
breath
and
offered
no
explanations
as
soon
as
sir
sagramor
got
well
he
notified
me
that
there
was
a
little
account
to
settle
between
us
and
he
named
a
day
three
or
four
years
in
the
future
place
of
settlement
the
lists
where
the
offense
had
been
given
i
said
i
would
be
ready
when
he
got
back
you
see
he
was
going
for
the
holy
grail
the
boys
all
took
a
flier
at
the
holy
grail
now
and
then
it
was
a
several
years
cruise
they
always
put
in
the
long
absence
snooping
around
in
the
most
conscientious
way
though
none
of
them
had
any
idea
where
the
holy
grail
really
was
and
i
dont
think
any
of
them
actually
expected
to
find
it
or
would
have
known
what
to
do
with
it
if
he
had
run
across
it
you
see
it
was
just
the
northwest
passage
of
that
day
as
you
may
say
that
was
all
every
year
expeditions
went
out
holy
grailing
and
next
year
relief
expeditions
went
out
to
hunt
for
them
there
was
worlds
of
reputation
in
it
but
no
money
why
they
actually
wanted
me
to
put
in
well
i
should
smile
chapter
x
beginnings
of
civilization
the
round
table
soon
heard
of
the
challenge
and
of
course
it
was
a
good
deal
discussed
for
such
things
interested
the
boys
the
king
thought
i
ought
now
to
set
forth
in
quest
of
adventures
so
that
i
might
gain
renown
and
be
the
more
worthy
to
meet
sir
sagramor
when
the
several
years
should
have
rolled
away
i
excused
myself
for
the
present
i
said
it
would
take
me
three
or
four
years
yet
to
get
things
well
fixed
up
and
going
smoothly
then
i
should
be
ready
all
the
chances
were
that
at
the
end
of
that
time
sir
sagramor
would
still
be
out
grailing
so
no
valuable
time
would
be
lost
by
the
postponement
i
should
then
have
been
in
office
six
or
seven
years
and
i
believed
my
system
and
machinery
would
be
so
well
developed
that
i
could
take
a
holiday
without
its
working
any
harm
i
was
pretty
well
satisfied
with
what
i
had
already
accomplished
in
various
quiet
nooks
and
corners
i
had
the
beginnings
of
all
sorts
of
industries
under
waynuclei
of

vast
factories
the
iron
and
steel
missionaries
of
my
future
civilization
in
these
were
gathered
together
the
brightest
young
minds
i
could
find
and
i
kept
agents
out
raking
the
country
for
more
all
the
time
i
was
training
a
crowd
of
ignorant
folk
into
expertsexperts
in
every
sort
of
handiwork
and
scientific
calling
these
nurseries
of
mine
went
smoothly
and
privately
along
undisturbed
in
their
obscure
country
retreats
for
nobody
was
allowed
to
come
into
their
precincts
without
a
special
permitfor
i
was
afraid
of
the
church
i
had
started
a
teacherfactory
and
a
lot
of
sundayschools
the
first
thing
as
a
result
i
now
had
an
admirable
system
of
graded
schools
in
full
blast
in
those
places
and
also
a
complete
variety
of
protestant
congregations
all
in
a
prosperous
and
growing
condition
everybody
could
be
any
kind
of
a
christian
he
wanted
to
there
was
perfect
freedom
in
that
matter
but
i
confined
public
religious
teaching
to
the
churches
and
the
sundayschools
permitting
nothing
of
it
in
my
other
educational
buildings
i
could
have
given
my
own
sect
the
preference
and
made
everybody
a
presbyterian
without
any
trouble
but
that
would
have
been
to
affront
a
law
of
human
nature
spiritual
wants
and
instincts
are
as
various
in
the
human
family
as
are
physical
appetites
complexions
and
features
and
a
man
is
only
at
his
best
morally
when
he
is
equipped
with
the
religious
garment
whose
color
and
shape
and
size
most
nicely
accommodate
themselves
to
the
spiritual
complexion
angularities
and
stature
of
the
individual
who
wears
it
and
besides
i
was
afraid
of
a
united
church
it
makes
a
mighty
power
the
mightiest
conceivable
and
then
when
it
by
and
by
gets
into
selfish
hands
as
it
is
always
bound
to
do
it
means
death
to
human
liberty
and
paralysis
to
human
thought
all
mines
were
royal
property
and
there
were
a
good
many
of
them
they
had
formerly
been
worked
as
savages
always
work
minesholes
grubbed
in
the
earth
and
the
mineral
brought
up
in
sacks
of
hide
by
hand
at
the
rate
of
a
ton
a
day
but
i
had
begun
to
put
the
mining
on
a
scientific
basis
as
early
as
i
could
yes
i
had
made
pretty
handsome
progress
when
sir
sagramors
challenge
struck
me
four
years
rolled
byand
then
well
you
would
never
imagine
it
in
the
world
unlimited
power
is
the
ideal
thing
when
it
is
in
safe
hands
the
despotism
of
heaven
is
the
one
absolutely
perfect
government
an
earthly
despotism
would
be
the
absolutely
perfect
earthly
government
if
the
conditions
were
the
same
namely
the
despot
the
perfectest
individual
of
the
human
race
and
his
lease
of
life
perpetual
but
as
a
perishable
perfect
man
must
die
and
leave
his
despotism
in
the
hands
of
an
imperfect
successor
an
earthly
despotism
is
not
merely
a
bad
form
of
government
it
is
the
worst
form
that
is
possible
my
works
showed
what
a
despot
could
do
with
the
resources
of
a
kingdom
at
his
command
unsuspected
by
this
dark
land
i
had
the
civilization
of
the
nineteenth
century
booming
under
its
very
nose
it
was
fenced
away
from
the
public
view
but
there
it
was
a
gigantic
and
unassailable
factand
to
be
heard
from
yet
if
i
lived
and
had
luck
there
it
was
as
sure
a
fact
and
as
substantial
a
fact
as
any
serene
volcano
standing
innocent
with
its
smokeless
summit
in
the
blue
sky
and
giving
no
sign
of
the
rising
hell
in
its
bowels
my
schools
and
churches
were
children
four
years
before
they
were
grownup
now
my
shops
of
that
day
were
vast
factories
now
where
i
had
a
dozen
trained
men
then
i
had
a
thousand
now
where
i
had
one
brilliant
expert
then
i
had
fifty
now
i
stood
with
my
hand
on
the
cock
so
to
speak
ready
to
turn
it
on
and
flood
the
midnight
world
with
light
at
any
moment
but
i
was
not
going
to
do
the
thing
in
that
sudden
way
it
was
not
my
policy
the
people
could
not
have
stood
it
and
moreover
i
should
have
had
the
established
roman
catholic
church
on
my
back
in
a
minute
no
i
had
been
going
cautiously
all
the
while
i
had
had
confidential
agents
trickling
through
the
country
some
time
whose
office
was
to
undermine
knighthood
by
imperceptible
degrees
and
to
gnaw
a
little
at
this
and
that
and
the
other
superstition
and
so
prepare
the
way
gradually
for
a
better
order
of
things
i
was
turning
on
my
light
onecandlepower
at
a
time
and
meant
to
continue
to
do
so
i
had
scattered
some
branch
schools
secretly
about
the
kingdom
and
they
were
doing
very
well
i
meant
to
work
this
racket
more
and
more
as
time
wore
on
if
nothing
occurred
to
frighten
me
one
of
my
deepest
secrets
was
my
west
pointmy
military
academy
i
kept
that
most
jealously
out
of
sight
and
i
did
the
same
with
my
naval
academy
which
i
had
established
at
a
remote
seaport
both
were
prospering
to
my
satisfaction
clarence
was
twentytwo
now
and
was
my
head
executive
my
right
hand
he
was
a
darling
he
was
equal
to
anything
there
wasnt
anything
he
couldnt
turn
his
hand
to
of
late
i
had
been
training
him
for
journalism
for
the
time
seemed
about
right
for
a
start
in
the
newspaper
line
nothing
big
but
just
a
small
weekly
for
experimental
circulation
in
my
civilizationnurseries
he
took
to
it
like
a
duck
there
was
an
editor
concealed
in
him
sure
already
he
had
doubled
himself
in
one
way
he
talked
sixth
century
and
wrote
nineteenth
his
journalistic
style
was
climbing
steadily
it
was
already
up
to
the
back
settlement
alabama
mark
and
couldnt
be
told
from
the
editorial
output
of
that
region
either
by
matter
or
flavor
we
had
another
large
departure
on
hand
too
this
was
a
telegraph
and
a
telephone
our
first
venture
in
this
line
these
wires
were
for
private
service
only
as
yet
and
must
be
kept
private
until
a
riper
day
should
come
we
had
a
gang
of
men
on
the
road
working
mainly
by
night
they
were
stringing
ground
wires
we
were
afraid
to
put
up
poles
for
they
would
attract
too
much
inquiry
ground
wires
were
good
enough
in
both
instances
for
my
wires
were
protected
by
an
insulation
of
my
own
invention
which
was
perfect
my
men
had
orders
to
strike
across
country
avoiding
roads
and
establishing
connection
with
any
considerable
towns
whose
lights
betrayed
their
presence
and
leaving
experts
in
charge
nobody
could
tell
you
how
to
find
any
place
in
the
kingdom
for
nobody
ever
went
intentionally
to
any
place
but
only
struck
it
by
accident
in
his
wanderings
and
then
generally
left
it
without
thinking
to
inquire
what
its
name
was
at
one
time
and
another
we
had
sent
out
topographical
expeditions
to
survey
and
map
the
kingdom
but
the
priests
had
always
interfered
and
raised
trouble
so
we
had
given
the
thing
up
for
the
present
it
would
be
poor
wisdom
to
antagonize
the
church
as
for
the
general
condition
of
the
country
it
was
as
it
had
been
when
i
arrived
in
it
to
all
intents
and
purposes
i
had
made
changes
but
they
were
necessarily
slight
and
they
were
not
noticeable
thus
far
i
had
not
even
meddled
with
taxation
outside
of
the
taxes
which
provided
the
royal
revenues
i
had
systematized
those
and
put
the
service
on
an
effective
and
righteous
basis
as
a
result
these
revenues
were
already
quadrupled
and
yet
the
burden
was
so
much
more
equably
distributed
than
before
that
all
the
kingdom
felt
a
sense
of
relief
and
the
praises
of
my
administration
were
hearty
and
general
personally
i
struck
an
interruption
now
but
i
did
not
mind
it
it
could
not
have
happened
at
a
better
time
earlier
it
could
have
annoyed
me
but
now
everything
was
in
good
hands
and
swimming
right
along
the
king
had
reminded
me
several
times
of
late
that
the
postponement
i
had
asked
for
four
years
before
had
about
run
out
now
it
was
a
hint
that
i
ought
to
be
starting
out
to
seek
adventures
and
get
up
a
reputation
of
a
size
to
make
me
worthy
of
the
honor
of
breaking
a
lance
with
sir
sagramor
who
was
still
out
grailing
but
was
being
hunted
for
by
various
relief
expeditions
and
might
be
found
any
year
now
so
you
see
i
was
expecting
this
interruption
it
did
not
take
me
by
surprise

xi
the
yankee
in
search
of
adventures
there
never
was
such
a
country
for
wandering
liars
and
they
were
of
both
sexes
hardly
a
month
went
by
without
one
of
these
tramps
arriving
and
generally
loaded
with
a
tale
about
some
princess
or
other
wanting
help
to
get
her
out
of
some
faraway
castle
where
she
was
held
in
captivity
by
a
lawless
scoundrel
usually
a
giant
now
you
would
think
that
the
first
thing
the
king
would
do
after
listening
to
such
a
novelette
from
an
entire
stranger
would
be
to
ask
for
credentialsyes
and

pointer
or
two
as
to
locality
of

best

to
it
and
so
on
but
nobody
ever
thought
of
so
simple
and
commonsense
a
thing
at
that
no
everybody
swallowed
these
peoples
lies
whole
and
never
asked
a
question
of
any
sort
or
about
anything
well
one
day
when
i
was
not
around
one
of
these
people
came
alongit
was
a
she
one
this
timeand
told
a
tale
of
the
usual
pattern
her
mistress
was
a
captive
in
a
vast
and
gloomy
castle
along
with
fortyfour
other
young
and
beautiful
girls
pretty
much
all
of
them
princesses
they
had
been
languishing
in
that
cruel
captivity
for
twentysix
years
the
masters
of
the
castle
were
three
stupendous
brothers
each
with
four
arms
and
one
eyethe
eye
in
the
center
of
the
forehead
and
as
big
as
a
fruit
sort
of
fruit
not
mentioned
their
usual
slovenliness
in
statistics
would
you
believe
it
the
king
and
the
whole
round
table
were
in
raptures
over
this
preposterous
opportunity
for
adventure
every
knight
of
the
table
jumped
for
the
chance
and
begged
for
it
but
to
their
vexation
and
chagrin
the
king
conferred
it
upon
me
who
had
not
asked
for
it
at
all
by
an
effort
i
contained
my
joy
when
clarence
brought
me
the
news
but
hehe
could
not
contain
his
his
mouth
gushed
delight
and
gratitude
in
a
steady
dischargedelight
in
my
good
fortune
gratitude
to
the
king
for
this
splendid
mark
of
his
favor
for
me
he
could
keep
neither
his
legs
nor
his
body
still
but
pirouetted
about
the
place
in
an
airy
ecstasy
of
happiness
on
my
side
i
could
have
cursed
the
kindness
that
conferred
upon
me
this
benefaction
but
i
kept
my
vexation
under
the
surface
for
policys
sake
and
did
what
i
could
to
let
on
to
be
glad
indeed
i
said
i
was
glad
and
in
a
way
it
was
true
i
was
as
glad
as
a
person
is
when
he
is
scalped
well
one
must
make
the
best
of
things
and
not
waste
time
with
useless
fretting
but
get
down
to
business
and
see
what
can
be
done
in
all
lies
there
is
wheat
among
the
chaff
i
must
get
at
the
wheat
in
this
case
so
i
sent
for
the
girl
and
she
came
she
was
a
comely
enough
creature
and
soft
and
modest
but
if
signs
went
for
anything
she
didnt
know
as
much
as
a
ladys
watch
i
said
my
dear
have
you
been
questioned
as
to
particulars
she
said
she
hadnt
well
i
didnt
expect
you
had
but
i
thought
i
would
ask
to
make
sure
its
the
way
ive
been
raised
now
you
mustnt
take
it
unkindly
if
i
remind
you
that
as
we
dont
know
you
we
must
go
a
little
slow
you
may
be
all
right
of
course
and
well
hope
that
you
are
but
to
take
it
for
granted
isnt
business
you
understand
that
im
obliged

of
it
dont
mind
my
seeming
excited
im
not
let
us
change
the
subject
now
as
to
this
castle
with
fortyfive
princesses
in
it
and
three
ogres
at
the
head
of
it
tell
mewhere
is
this
harem
harem
the
castle
you
understand
where
is
the
castle
oh
as
to
that
it
is
great
and
strong
and
well
beseen
and
lieth
in
a
far
country
yes
it
is
many
leagues
how
many
ah
fair
sir
it
were
woundily
hard
to
tell
they
are
so
many
and
do
so
lap
the
one
upon
the
other
and
being
made
all
in
the
same
image
and
tincted
with
the
same
color
one
may
not
know
the
one
league
from
its
fellow
nor
how
to
count
them
except
they
be
taken
apart
and
ye
wit
well
it
were
gods
work
to
do
that
being
not
within
mans
capacity
for
ye
will
note
hold
on
hold
on
never
mind
about
the
distance
whereabouts
does
the
castle
lie
whats
the
direction
from
here
ah
please
you
sir
it
hath
no
direction
from
here
by
reason
that
the
road
lieth
not
straight
but
turneth
evermore
wherefore
the
direction
of
its
place
abideth
not
but
is
some
time
under
the
one
sky
and
anon
under
another
whereso
if
ye
be
minded
that
it
is
in
the
east
and
wend
thitherward
ye
shall
observe
that
the
way
of
the
road
doth
yet
again
turn
upon
itself
by
the
space
of
half
a
circle
and
this
marvel
happing
again
and
yet
again
and
still
again
it
will
grieve
you
that
you
had
thought
by
vanities
of
the
mind
to
thwart
and
bring
to
naught
the
will
of
him
that
giveth
not
a
castle
a
direction
from
a
place
except
it
pleaseth
him
and
if
it
please
him
not
will
the
rather
that
even
all
castles
and
all
directions
thereunto
vanish
out
of
the
earth
leaving
the
places
wherein
they
tarried
desolate
and
vacant
so
warning
his
creatures
that
where
he
will
he
will
and
where
he
will
not
he
oh
thats
all
right
thats
all
right
give
us
a
rest
never
mind
about
the
direction
hang
the
directioni
beg
pardon
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
i
am
not
well
today
pay
no
attention
when
i
soliloquize
it
is
an
old
habit
an
old
bad
habit
and
hard
to
get
rid
of
when
ones
digestion
is
all
disordered
with
eating
food
that
was
raised
forever
and
ever
before
he
was
born
good
land
a
man
cant
keep
his
functions
regular
on
spring
chickens
thirteen
hundred
years
old
but
comenever
mind
about
that
letshave
you
got
such
a
thing
as
a
map
of
that
region
about
you
now
a
good
map
is
it
peradventure
that
manner
of
thing
which
of
late
the
unbelievers
have
brought
from
over
the
great
seas
which
being
boiled
in
oil
and
an
onion
and
salt
added
thereto
doth
what
a
map
what
are
you
talking
about
dont
you
know
what
a
map
is
there
there
never
mind
dont
explain
i
hate
explanations
they
fog
a
thing
up
so
that
you
cant
tell
anything
about
it
run
along
dear
goodday
show
her
the
way
clarence
oh
well
it
was
reasonably
plain
now
why
these
donkeys
didnt
prospect
these
liars
for
details
it
may
be
that
this
girl
had
a
fact
in
her
somewhere
but
i
dont
believe
you
could
have
sluiced
it
out
with
a
hydraulic
nor
got
it
with
the
earlier
forms
of
blasting
even
it
was
a
case
for
dynamite
why
she
was
a
perfect
ass
and
yet
the
king
and
his
knights
had
listened
to
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
leaf
out
of
the
gospel
it
kind
of
sizes
up
the
whole
party
and
think
of
the
simple
ways
of
this
court
this
wandering
wench
hadnt
any
more
trouble
to
get
access
to
the
king
in
his
palace
than
she
would
have
had
to
get
into
the
poorhouse
in
my
day
and
country
in
fact
he
was
glad
to
see
her
glad
to
hear
her
tale
with
that
adventure
of
hers
to
offer
she
was
as
welcome
as
a
corpse
is
to
a
coroner
just
as
i
was
endingup
these
reflections
clarence
came
back
i
remarked
upon
the
barren
result
of
my
efforts
with
the
girl
hadnt
got
hold
of
a
single
point
that
could
help
me
to
find
the
castle
the
youth
looked
a
little
surprised
or
puzzled
or
something
and
intimated
that
he
had
been
wondering
to
himself
what
i
had
wanted
to
ask
the
girl
all
those
questions
for
why
great
guns
i
said
dont
i
want
to
find
the
castle
and
how
else
would
i
go
about
it
la
sweet
your
worship
one
may
lightly
answer
that
i
ween
she
will
go
with
thee
they
always
do
she
will
ride
with
thee
ride
with
me
nonsense
but
of
a
truth
she
will
she
will
ride
with
thee
thou
shalt
see
what
she
browse
around
the
hills
and
scour
the
woods
with
me
aloneand
i
as
good
as
engaged
to
be
married
why
its
scandalous
think
how
it
would
look
my
the
dear
face
that
rose
before
me
the
boy
was
eager
to
know
all
about
this
tender
matter
i
swore
him
to
secrecy
and
then
whispered
her
namepuss
flanagan
he
looked
disappointed
and
said
he
didnt
remember
the
countess
how
natural
it
was
for
the
little
courtier
to
give
her
a
rank
he
asked
me
where
she
lived
in
east
har
i
came
to
myself
and
stopped
a
little
confused
then
i
said
never
mind
now
ill
tell
you
some
time
and
might
he
see
her
would
i
let
him
see
her
some
day
it
was
but
a
little
thing
to
promisethirteen
hundred
years
or
soand
he
so
eager
so
i
said
yes
but
i
sighed
i
couldnt
help
it
and
yet
there
was
no
sense
in
sighing
for
she
wasnt
born
yet
but
that
is
the
way
we
are
made
we
dont
reason
where
we
feel
we
just
feel
my
expedition
was
all
the
talk
that
day
and
that
night
and
the
boys
were
very
good
to
me
and
made
much
of
me
and
seemed
to
have
forgotten
their
vexation
and
disappointment
and
come
to
be
as
anxious
for
me
to
hive
those
ogres
and
set
those
ripe
old
virgins
loose
as
if
it
were
themselves
that
had
the
contract
well
they
were
good
childrenbut
just
children
that
is
all
and
they
gave
me
no
end
of
points
about
how
to
scout
for
giants
and
how
to
scoop
them
in
and
they
told
me
all
sorts
of
charms
against
enchantments
and
gave
me
salves
and
other
rubbish
to
put
on
my
wounds
but
it
never
occurred
to
one
of
them
to
reflect
that
if
i
was
such
a
wonderful
necromancer
as
i
was
pretending
to
be
i
ought
not
to
need
salves
or
instructions
or
charms
against
enchantments
and
least
of
all
arms
and
armor
on
a
foray
of
any
kindeven
against
firespouting
dragons
and
devils
hot
from
perdition
let
alone
such
poor
adversaries
as
these
i
was
after
these
commonplace
ogres
of
the
back
settlements
i
was
to
have
an
early
breakfast
and
start
at
dawn
for
that
was
the
usual
way
but
i
had
the
demons
own
time
with
my
armor
and
this
delayed
me
a
little
it
is
troublesome
to
get
into
and
there
is
so
much
detail
first
you
wrap
a
layer
or
two
of
blanket
around
your
body
for
a
sort
of
cushion
and
to
keep
off
the
cold
iron
then
you
put
on
your
sleeves
and
shirt
of
chain
mailthese
are
made
of
small
steel
links
woven
together
and
they
form
a
fabric
so
flexible
that
if
you
toss
your
shirt
onto
the
floor
it
slumps
into
a
pile
like
a
peck
of
wet
fishnet
it
is
very
heavy
and
is
nearly
the
uncomfortablest
material
in
the
world
for
a
night
shirt
yet
plenty
used
it
for
thattax
collectors
and
reformers
and
onehorse
kings
with
a
defective
title
and
those
sorts
of
people
then
you
put
on
your
shoesflatboats
roofed
over
with
interleaving
bands
of
steeland
screw
your
clumsy
spurs
into
the
heels
next
you
buckle
your
greaves
on
your
legs
and
your
cuisses
on
your
thighs
then
come
your
backplate
and
your
breastplate
and
you
begin
to
feel
crowded
then
you
hitch
onto
the
breastplate
the
halfpetticoat
of
broad
overlapping
bands
of
steel
which
hangs
down
in
front
but
is
scolloped
out
behind
so
you
can
sit
down
and
isnt
any
real
improvement
on
an
inverted
coal
scuttle
either
for
looks
or
for
wear
or
to
wipe
your
hands
on
next
you
belt
on
your
sword
then
you
put
your
stovepipe
joints
onto
your
arms
your
iron
gauntlets
onto
your
hands
your
iron
rattrap
onto
your
head
with
a
rag
of
steel
web
hitched
onto
it
to
hang
over
the
back
of
your
neckand
there
you
are
snug
as
a
candle
in
a
candlemould
this
is
no
time
to
dance
well
a
man
that
is
packed
away
like
that
is
a
nut
that
isnt
worth
the
cracking
there
is
so
little
of
the
meat
when
you
get
down
to
it
by
comparison
with
the
shell
the
boys
helped
me
or
i
never
could
have
got
in
just
as
we
finished
sir
bedivere
happened
in
and
i
saw
that
as
like
as
not
i
hadnt
chosen
the
most
convenient
outfit
for
a
long
trip
how
stately
he
looked
and
tall
and
broad
and
grand
he
had
on
his
head
a
conical
steel
casque
that
only
came
down
to
his
ears
and
for
visor
had
only
a
narrow
steel
bar
that
extended
down
to
his
upper
lip
and
protected
his
nose
and
all
the
rest
of
him
from
neck
to
heel
was
flexible
chain
mail
trousers
and
all
but
pretty
much
all
of
him
was
hidden
under
his
outside
garment
which
of
course
was
of
chain
mail
as
i
said
and
hung
straight
from
his
shoulders
to
his
ankles
and
from
his
middle
to
the
bottom
both
before
and
behind
was
divided
so
that
he
could
ride
and
let
the
skirts
hang
down
on
each
side
he
was
going
grailing
and
it
was
just
the
outfit
for
it
too
i
would
have
given
a
good
deal
for
that
ulster
but
it
was
too
late
now
to
be
fooling
around
the
sun
was
just
up
the
king
and
the
court
were
all
on
hand
to
see
me
off
and
wish
me
luck
so
it
wouldnt
be
etiquette
for
me
to
tarry
you
dont
get
on
your
horse
yourself
no
if
you
tried
it
you
would
get
disappointed
they
carry
you
out
just
as
they
carry
a
sunstruck
man
to
the
drug
store
and
put
you
on
and
help
get
you
to
rights
and
fix
your
feet
in
the
stirrups
and
all
the
while
you
do
feel
so
strange
and
stuffy
and
like
somebody
elselike
somebody
that
has
been
married
on
a
sudden
or
struck
by
lightning
or
something
like
that
and
hasnt
quite
fetched
around
yet
and
is
sort
of
numb
and
cant
just
get
his
bearings
then
they
stood
up
the
mast
they
called
a
spear
in
its
socket
by
my
left
foot
and
i
gripped
it
with
my
hand
lastly
they
hung
my
shield
around
my
neck
and
i
was
all
complete
and
ready
to
up
anchor
and
get
to
sea
everybody
was
as
good
to
me
as
they
could
be
and
a
maid
of
honor
gave
me
the
stirrupcup
her
own
self
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
now
but
for
that
damsel
to
get
up
behind
me
on
a
pillion
which
she
did
and
put
an
arm
or
so
around
me
to
hold
on
and
so
we
started
and
everybody
gave
us
a
goodbye
and
waved
their
handkerchiefs
or
helmets
and
everybody
we
met
going
down
the
hill
and
through
the
village
was
respectful
to
us
except
some
shabby
little
boys
on
the
outskirts
they
said
oh
what
a
guy
and
hove
clods
at
us
in
my
experience
boys
are
the
same
in
all
ages
they
dont
respect
anything
they
dont
care
for
anything
or
anybody
they
say
go
up
baldhead
to
the
prophet
going
his
unoffending
way
in
the
gray
of
antiquity
they
sass
me
in
the
holy
gloom
of
the
middle
ages
and
i
had
seen
them
act
the
same
way
in
buchanans
administration
i
remember
because
i
was
there
and
helped
the
prophet
had
his
bears
and
settled
with
his
boys
and
i
wanted
to
get
down
and
settle
with
mine
but
it
wouldnt
answer
because
i
couldnt
have
got
up
again
i
hate
a
country
without
a
derrick
chapter
xii
slow
torture
straight
off
we
were
in
the
country
it
was
most
lovely
and
pleasant
in
those
sylvan
solitudes
in
the
early
cool
morning
in
the
first
freshness
of
autumn
from
hilltops
we
saw
fair
green
valleys
lying
spread
out
below
with
streams
winding
through
them
and
island
groves
of
trees
here
and
there
and
huge
lonely
oaks
scattered
about
and
casting
black
blots
of
shade
and
beyond
the
valleys
we
saw
the
ranges
of
hills
blue
with
haze
stretching
away
in
billowy
perspective
to
the
horizon
with
at
wide
intervals
a
dim
fleck
of
white
or
gray
on
a
wavesummit
which
we
knew
was
a
castle
we
crossed
broad
natural
lawns
sparkling
with
dew
and
we
moved
like
spirits
the
cushioned
turf
giving
out
no
sound
of
footfall
we
dreamed
along
through
glades
in
a
mist
of
green
light
that
got
its
tint
from
the
sundrenched
roof
of
leaves
overhead
and
by
our
feet
the
clearest
and
coldest
of
runlets
went
frisking
and
gossiping
over
its
reefs
and
making
a
sort
of
whispering
music
comfortable
to
hear
and
at
times
we
left
the
world
behind
and
entered
into
the
solemn
great
deeps
and
rich
gloom
of
the
forest
where
furtive
wild
things
whisked
and
scurried
by
and
were
gone
before
you
could
even
get
your
eye
on
the
place
where
the
noise
was
and
where
only
the
earliest
birds
were
turning
out
and
getting
to
business
with
a
song
here
and
a
quarrel
yonder
and
a
mysterious
faroff
hammering
and
drumming
for
worms
on
a
tree
trunk
away
somewhere
in
the
impenetrable
remotenesses
of
the
woods
and
by
and
by
out
we
would
swing
again
into
the
glare
about
the
third
or
fourth
or
fifth
time
that
we
swung
out
into
the
glareit
was
along
there
somewhere
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
after
sunupit
wasnt
as
pleasant
as
it
had
been
it
was
beginning
to
get
hot
this
was
quite
noticeable
we
had
a
very
long
pull
after
that
without
any
shade
now
it
is
curious
how
progressively
little
frets
grow
and
multiply
after
they
once
get
a
start
things
which
i
didnt
mind
at
all
at
first
i
began
to
mind
nowand
more
and
more
too
all
the
time
the
first
ten
or
fifteen
times
i
wanted
my
handkerchief
i
didnt
seem
to
care
i
got
along
and
said
never
mind
it
isnt
any
matter
and
dropped
it
out
of
my
mind
but
now
it
was
different
i
wanted
it
all
the
time
it
was
nag
nag
nag
right
along
and
no
rest
i
couldnt
get
it
out
of
my
mind
and
so
at
last
i
lost
my
temper
and
said
hang
a
man
that
would
make
a
suit
of
armor
without
any
pockets
in
it
you
see
i
had
my
handkerchief
in
my
helmet
and
some
other
things
but
it
was
that
kind
of
a
helmet
that
you
cant
take
off
by
yourself
that
hadnt
occurred
to
me
when
i
put
it
there
and
in
fact
i
didnt
know
it
i
supposed
it
would
be
particularly
convenient
there
and
so
now
the
thought
of
its
being
there
so
handy
and
close
by
and
yet
not
getatable
made
it
all
the
worse
and
the
harder
to
bear
yes
the
thing
that
you
cant
get
is
the
thing
that
you
want
mainly
every
one
has
noticed
that
well
it
took
my
mind
off
from
everything
else
took
it
clear
off
and
centered
it
in
my
helmet
and
mile
after
mile
there
it
stayed
imagining
the
handkerchief
picturing
the
handkerchief
and
it
was
bitter
and
aggravating
to
have
the
salt
sweat
keep
trickling
down
into
my
eyes
and
i
couldnt
get
at
it
it
seems
like
a
little
thing
on
paper
but
it
was
not
a
little
thing
at
all
it
was
the
most
real
kind
of
misery
i
would
not
say
it
if
it
was
not
so
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
carry
along
a
reticule
next
time
let
it
look
how
it
might
and
people
say
what
they
would
of
course
these
iron
dudes
of
the
round
table
would
think
it
was
scandalous
and
maybe
raise
sheol
about
it
but
as
for
me
give
me
comfort
first
and
style
afterwards
so
we
jogged
along
and
now
and
then
we
struck
a
stretch
of
dust
and
it
would
tumble
up
in
clouds
and
get
into
my
nose
and
make
me
sneeze
and
cry
and
of
course
i
said
things
i
oughtnt
to
have
said
i
dont
deny
that
i
am
not
better
than
others
we
couldnt
seem
to
meet
anybody
in
this
lonesome
britain
not
even
an
ogre
and
in
the
mood
i
was
in
then
it
was
well
for
the
ogre
that
is
an
ogre
with
a
handkerchief
most
knights
would
have
thought
of
nothing
but
getting
his
armor
but
so
i
got
his
bandanna
he
could
keep
his
hardware
for
all
of
me
meantime
it
was
getting
hotter
and
hotter
in
there
you
see
the
sun
was
beating
down
and
warming
up
the
iron
more
and
more
all
the
time
well
when
you
are
hot
that
way
every
little
thing
irritates
you
when
i
trotted
i
rattled
like
a
crate
of
dishes
and
that
annoyed
me
and
moreover
i
couldnt
seem
to
stand
that
shield
slatting
and
banging
now
about
my
breast
now
around
my
back
and
if
i
dropped
into
a
walk
my
joints
creaked
and
screeched
in
that
wearisome
way
that
a
wheelbarrow
does
and
as
we
didnt
create
any
breeze
at
that
gait
i
was
like
to
get
fried
in
that
stove
and
besides
the
quieter
you
went
the
heavier
the
iron
settled
down
on
you
and
the
more
and
more
tons
you
seemed
to
weigh
every
minute
and
you
had
to
be
always
changing
hands
and
passing
your
spear
over
to
the
other
foot
it
got
so
irksome
for
one
hand
to
hold
it
long
at
a
time
well
you
know
when
you
perspire
that
way
in
rivers
there
comes
a
time
when
youwhen
youwell
when
you
itch
you
are
inside
your
hands
are
outside
so
there
you
are
nothing
but
iron
between
it
is
not
a
light
thing
let
it
sound
as
it
may
first
it
is
one
place
then
another
then
some
more
and
it
goes
on
spreading
and
spreading
and
at
last
the
territory
is
all
occupied
and
nobody
can
imagine
what
you
feel
like
nor
how
unpleasant
it
is
and
when
it
had
got
to
the
worst
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
not
stand
anything
more
a
fly
got
in
through
the
bars
and
settled
on
my
nose
and
the
bars
were
stuck
and
wouldnt
work
and
i
couldnt
get
the
visor
up
and
i
could
only
shake
my
head
which
was
baking
hot
by
this
time
and
the
flywell
you
know
how
a
fly
acts
when
he
has
got
a
certaintyhe
only
minded
the
shaking
enough
to
change
from
nose
to
lip
and
lip
to
ear
and
buzz
and
buzz
all
around
in
there
and
keep
on
lighting
and
biting
in
a
way
that
a
person
already
so
distressed
as
i
was
simply
could
not
stand
so
i
gave
in
and
got
alisande
to
unship
the
helmet
and
relieve
me
of
it
then
she
emptied
the
conveniences
out
of
it
and
fetched
it
full
of
water
and
i
drank
and
then
stood
up
and
she
poured
the
rest
down
inside
the
armor
one
cannot
think
how
refreshing
it
was
she
continued
to
fetch
and
pour
until
i
was
well
soaked
and
thoroughly
comfortable
it
was
good
to
have
a
restand
peace
but
nothing
is
quite
perfect
in
this
life
at
any
time
i
had
made
a
pipe
a
while
back
and
also
some
pretty
fair
tobacco
not
the
real
thing
but
what
some
of
the
indians
use
the
inside
bark
of
the
willow
dried
these
comforts
had
been
in
the
helmet
and
now
i
had
them
again
but
no
matches
gradually
as
the
time
wore
along
one
annoying
fact
was
borne
in
upon
my
understandingthat
we
were
weatherbound
an
armed
novice
cannot
mount
his
horse
without
help
and
plenty
of
it
sandy
was
not
enough
not
enough
for
me
anyway
we
had
to
wait
until
somebody
should
come
along
waiting
in
silence
would
have
been
agreeable
enough
for
i
was
full
of
matter
for
reflection
and
wanted
to
give
it
a
chance
to
work
i
wanted
to
try
and
think
out
how
it
was
that
rational
or
even
halfrational
men
could
ever
have
learned
to
wear
armor
considering
its
inconveniences
and
how
they
had
managed
to
keep
up
such
a
fashion
for
generations
when
it
was
plain
that
what
i
had
suffered
today
they
had
had
to
suffer
all
the
days
of
their
lives
i
wanted
to
think
that
out
and
moreover
i
wanted
to
think
out
some
way
to
reform
this
evil
and
persuade
the
people
to
let
the
foolish
fashion
die
out
but
thinking
was
out
of
the
question
in
the
circumstances
you
couldnt
think
where
sandy
was
she
was
a
quite
biddable
creature
and
goodhearted
but
she
had
a
flow
of
talk
that
was
as
steady
as
a
mill
and
made
your
head
sore
like
the
drays
and
wagons
in
a
city
if
she
had
had
a
cork
she
would
have
been
a
comfort
but
you
cant
cork
that
kind
they
would
die
her
clack
was
going
all
day
and
you
would
think
something
would
surely
happen
to
her
works
by
and
by
but
no
they
never
got
out
of
order
and
she
never
had
to
slack
up
for
words
she
could
grind
and
pump
and
churn
and
buzz
by
the
week
and
never
stop
to
oil
up
or
blow
out
and
yet
the
result
was
just
nothing
but
wind
she
never
had
any
ideas
any
more
than
a
fog
has
she
was
a
perfect
blatherskite
i
mean
for
jaw
jaw
jaw
talk
talk
talk
jabber
jabber
jabber
but
just
as
good
as
she
could
be
i
hadnt
minded
her
mill
that
morning
on
account
of
having
that
hornets
nest
of
other
troubles
but
more
than
once
in
the
afternoon
i
had
to
say
take
a
rest
child
the
way
you
are
using
up
all
the

freemen
yes
it
is
strange
how
little
a
while
at
a
time
a
person
can
be
contented
only
a
little
while
back
when
i
was
riding
and
suffering
what
a
heaven
this
peace
this
rest
this
sweet
serenity
in
this
secluded
shady
nook
by
this
purling
stream
would
have
seemed
where
i
could
keep
perfectly
comfortable
all
the
time
by
pouring
a
dipper
of
water
into
my
armor
now
and
then
yet
already
i
was
getting
dissatisfied
partly
because
i
could
not
light
my
pipefor
although
i
had
long
ago
started
a
match
factory
i
had
forgotten
to
bring
matches
with
meand
partly
because
we
had
nothing
to
eat
here
was
another
illustration
of
the
childlike
improvidence
of
this
age
and
people
a
man
in
armor
always
trusted
to
chance
for
his
food
on
a
journey
and
would
have
been
scandalized
at
the
idea
of
hanging
a
basket
of
sandwiches
on
his
spear
there
was
probably
not
a
knight
of
all
the
round
table
combination
who
would
not
rather
have
died
than
been
caught
carrying
such
a
thing
as
that
on
his
flagstaff
and
yet
there
could
not
be
anything
more
sensible
it
had
been
my
intention
to
smuggle
a
couple
of
sandwiches
into
my
helmet
but
i
was
interrupted
in
the
act
and
had
to
make
an
excuse
and
lay
them
aside
and
a
dog
got
them
night
approached
and
with
it
a
storm
the
darkness
came
on
fast
we
must
camp
of
course
i
found
a
good
shelter
for
the
demoiselle
under
a
rock
and
went
off
and
found
another
for
myself
but
i
was
obliged
to
remain
in
my
armor
because
i
could
not
get
it
off
by
myself
and
yet
could
not
allow
alisande
to
help
because
it
would
have
seemed
so
like
undressing
before
folk
it
would
not
have
amounted
to
that
in
reality
because
i
had
clothes
on
underneath
but
the
prejudices
of
ones
breeding
are
not
gotten
rid
of
just
at
a
jump
and
i
knew
that
when
it
came
to
stripping
off
that
bobtailed
iron
petticoat
i
should
be
embarrassed
with
the
storm
came
a
change
of
weather
and
the
stronger
the
wind
blew
and
the
wilder
the
rain
lashed
around
the
colder
and
colder
it
got
pretty
soon
various
kinds
of
bugs
and
ants
and
worms
and
things
began
to
flock
in
out
of
the
wet
and
crawl
down
inside
my
armor
to
get
warm
and
while
some
of
them
behaved
well
enough
and
snuggled
up
amongst
my
clothes
and
got
quiet
the
majority
were
of
a
restless
uncomfortable
sort
and
never
stayed
still
but
went
on
prowling
and
hunting
for
they
did
not
know
what
especially
the
ants
which
went
tickling
along
in
wearisome
procession
from
one
end
of
me
to
the
other
by
the
hour
and
are
a
kind
of
creatures
which
i
never
wish
to
sleep
with
again
it
would
be
my
advice
to
persons
situated
in
this
way
to
not
roll
or
thrash
around
because
this
excites
the
interest
of
all
the
different
sorts
of
animals
and
makes
every
last
one
of
them
want
to
turn
out
and
see
what
is
going
on
and
this
makes
things
worse
than
they
were
before
and
of
course
makes
you
objurgate
harder
too
if
you
can
still
if
one
did
not
roll
and
thrash
around
he
would
die
so
perhaps
it
is
as
well
to
do
one
way
as
the
other
there
is
no
real
choice
even
after
i
was
frozen
solid
i
could
still
distinguish
that
tickling
just
as
a
corpse
does
when
he
is
taking
electric
treatment
i
said
i
would
never
wear
armor
after
this
trip
all
those
trying
hours
whilst
i
was
frozen
and
yet
was
in
a
living
fire
as
you
may
say
on
account
of
that
swarm
of
crawlers
that
same
unanswerable
question
kept
circling
and
circling
through
my
tired
head
how
do
people
stand
this
miserable
armor
how
have
they
managed
to
stand
it
all
these
generations
how
can
they
sleep
at
night
for
dreading
the
tortures
of
next
day
when
the
morning
came
at
last
i
was
in
a
bad
enough
plight
seedy
drowsy
fagged
from
want
of
sleep
weary
from
thrashing
around
famished
from
long
fasting
pining
for
a
bath
and
to
get
rid
of
the
animals
and
crippled
with
rheumatism
and
how
had
it
fared
with
the
nobly
born
the
titled
aristocrat
the
demoiselle
alisande
la
carteloise
why
she
was
as
fresh
as
a
squirrel
she
had
slept
like
the
dead
and
as
for
a
bath
probably
neither
she
nor
any
other
noble
in
the
land
had
ever
had
one
and
so
she
was
not
missing
it
measured
by
modern
standards
they
were
merely
modified
savages
those
people
this
noble
lady
showed
no
impatience
to
get
to
breakfastand
that
smacks
of
the
savage
too
on
their
journeys
those
britons
were
used
to
long
fasts
and
knew
how
to
bear
them
and
also
how
to
freight
up
against
probable
fasts
before
starting
after
the
style
of
the
indian
and
the
anaconda
as
like
as
not
sandy
was
loaded
for
a
threeday
stretch
we
were
off
before
sunrise
sandy
riding
and
i
limping
along
behind
in
half
an
hour
we
came
upon
a
group
of
ragged
poor
creatures
who
had
assembled
to
mend
the
thing
which
was
regarded
as
a
road
they
were
as
humble
as
animals
to
me
and
when
i
proposed
to
breakfast
with
them
they
were
so
flattered
so
overwhelmed
by
this
extraordinary
condescension
of
mine
that
at
first
they
were
not
able
to
believe
that
i
was
in
earnest
my
lady
put
up
her
scornful
lip
and
withdrew
to
one
side
she
said
in
their
hearing
that
she
would
as
soon
think
of
eating
with
the
other
cattlea
remark
which
embarrassed
these
poor
devils
merely
because
it
referred
to
them
and
not
because
it
insulted
or
offended
them
for
it
didnt
and
yet
they
were
not
slaves
not
chattels
by
a
sarcasm
of
law
and
phrase
they
were
freemen
seventenths
of
the
free
population
of
the
country
were
of
just
their
class
and
degree
small
independent
farmers
artisans
etc
which
is
to
say
they
were
the
nation
the
actual
nation
they
were
about
all
of
it
that
was
useful
or
worth
saving
or
really
respectworthy
and
to
subtract
them
would
have
been
to
subtract
the
nation
and
leave
behind
some
dregs
some
refuse
in
the
shape
of
a
king
nobility
and
gentry
idle
unproductive
acquainted
mainly
with
the
arts
of
wasting
and
destroying
and
of
no
sort
of
use
or
value
in
any
rationally
constructed
world
and
yet
by
ingenious
contrivance
this
gilded
minority
instead
of
being
in
the
tail
of
the
procession
where
it
belonged
was
marching
head
up
and
banners
flying
at
the
other
end
of
it
had
elected
itself
to
be
the
nation
and
these
innumerable
clams
had
permitted
it
so
long
that
they
had
come
at
last
to
accept
it
as
a
truth
and
not
only
that
but
to
believe
it
right
and
as
it
should
be
the
priests
had
told
their
fathers
and
themselves
that
this
ironical
state
of
things
was
ordained
of
god
and
so
not
reflecting
upon
how
unlike
god
it
would
be
to
amuse
himself
with
sarcasms
and
especially
such
poor
transparent
ones
as
this
they
had
dropped
the
matter
there
and
become
respectfully
quiet
the
talk
of
these
meek
people
had
a
strange
enough
sound
in
a
formerly
american
ear
they
were
freemen
but
they
could
not
leave
the
estates
of
their
lord
or
their
bishop
without
his
permission
they
could
not
prepare
their
own
bread
but
must
have
their
corn
ground
and
their
bread
baked
at
his
mill
and
his
bakery
and
pay
roundly
for
the
same
they
could
not
sell
a
piece
of
their
own
property
without
paying
him
a
handsome
percentage
of
the
proceeds
nor
buy
a
piece
of
somebody
elses
without
remembering
him
in
cash
for
the
privilege
they
had
to
harvest
his
grain
for
him
gratis
and
be
ready
to
come
at
a
moments
notice
leaving
their
own
crop
to
destruction
by
the
threatened
storm
they
had
to
let
him
plant
fruit
trees
in
their
fields
and
then
keep
their
indignation
to
themselves
when
his
heedless
fruitgatherers
trampled
the
grain
around
the
trees
they
had
to
smother
their
anger
when
his
hunting
parties
galloped
through
their
fields
laying
waste
the
result
of
their
patient
toil
they
were
not
allowed
to
keep
doves
themselves
and
when
the
swarms
from
my
lords
dovecote
settled
on
their
crops
they
must
not
lose
their
temper
and
kill
a
bird
for
awful
would
the
penalty
be
when
the
harvest
was
at
last
gathered
then
came
the
procession
of
robbers
to
levy
their
blackmail
upon
it
first
the
church
carted
off
its
fat
tenth
then
the
kings
commissioner
took
his
twentieth
then
my
lords
people
made
a
mighty
inroad
upon
the
remainder
after
which
the
skinned
freeman
had
liberty
to
bestow
the
remnant
in
his
barn
in
case
it
was
worth
the
trouble
there
were
taxes
and
taxes
and
taxes
and
more
taxes
and
taxes
again
and
yet
other
taxesupon
this
free
and
independent
pauper
but
none
upon
his
lord
the
baron
or
the
bishop
none
upon
the
wasteful
nobility
or
the
alldevouring
church
if
the
baron
would
sleep
unvexed
the
freeman
must
sit
up
all
night
after
his
days
work
and
whip
the
ponds
to
keep
the
frogs
quiet
if
the
freemans
daughterbut
no
that
last
infamy
of
monarchical
government
is
unprintable
and
finally
if
the
freeman
grown
desperate
with
his
tortures
found
his
life
unendurable
under
such
conditions
and
sacrificed
it
and
fled
to
death
for
mercy
and
refuge
the
gentle
church
condemned
him
to
eternal
fire
the
gentle
law
buried
him
at
midnight
at
the
crossroads
with
a
stake
through
his
back
and
his
master
the
baron
or
the
bishop
confiscated
all
his
property
and
turned
his
widow
and
his
orphans
out
of
doors
and
here
were
these
freemen
assembled
in
the
early
morning
to
work
on
their
lord
the
bishops
road
three
days
eachgratis
every
head
of
a
family
and
every
son
of
a
family
three
days
each
gratis
and
a
day
or
so
added
for
their
servants
why
it
was
like
reading
about
france
and
the
french
before
the
ever
memorable
and
blessed
revolution
which
swept
a
thousand
years
of
such
villany
away
in
one
swift
tidalwave
of
bloodone
a
settlement
of
that
hoary
debt
in
the
proportion
of
half
a
drop
of
blood
for
each
hogshead
of
it
that
had
been
pressed
by
slow
tortures
out
of
that
people
in
the
weary
stretch
of
ten
centuries
of
wrong
and
shame
and
misery
the
like
of
which
was
not
to
be
mated
but
in
hell
there
were
two
reigns
of
terror
if
we
would
but
remember
it
and
consider
it
the
one
wrought
murder
in
hot
passion
the
other
in
heartless
cold
blood
the
one
lasted
mere
months
the
other
had
lasted
a
thousand
years
the
one
inflicted
death
upon
ten
thousand
persons
the
other
upon
a
hundred
millions
but
our
shudders
are
all
for
the
horrors
of
the
minor
terror
the
momentary
terror
so
to
speak
whereas
what
is
the
horror
of
swift
death
by
the
axe
compared
with
lifelong
death
from
hunger
cold
insult
cruelty
and
heartbreak
what
is
swift
death
by
lightning
compared
with
death
by
slow
fire
at
the
stake
a
city
cemetery
could
contain
the
coffins
filled
by
that
brief
terror
which
we
have
all
been
so
diligently
taught
to
shiver
at
and
mourn
over
but
all
france
could
hardly
contain
the
coffins
filled
by
that
older
and
real
terror
that
unspeakably
bitter
and
awful
terror
which
none
of
us
has
been
taught
to
see
in
its
vastness
or
pity
as
it
deserves
these
poor
ostensible
freemen
who
were
sharing
their
breakfast
and
their
talk
with
me
were
as
full
of
humble
reverence
for
their
king
and
church
and
nobility
as
their
worst
enemy
could
desire
there
was
something
pitifully
ludicrous
about
it
i
asked
them
if
they
supposed
a
nation
of
people
ever
existed
who
with
a
free
vote
in
every
mans
hand
would
elect
that
a
single
family
and
its
descendants
should
reign
over
it
forever
whether
gifted
or
boobies
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
familiesincluding
the
voters
and
would
also
elect
that
a
certain
hundred
families
should
be
raised
to
dizzy
summits
of
rank
and
clothed
on
with
offensive
transmissible
glories
and
privileges
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest
of
the
nations
familiesincluding
his
own
they
all
looked
unhit
and
said
they
didnt
know
that
they
had
never
thought
about
it
before
and
it
hadnt
ever
occurred
to
them
that
a
nation
could
be
so
situated
that
every
man
could
have
a
say
in
the
government
i
said
i
had
seen
oneand
that
it
would
last
until
it
had
an
established
church
again
they
were
all
unhitat
first
but
presently
one
man
looked
up
and
asked
me
to
state
that
proposition
again
and
state
it
slowly
so
it
could
soak
into
his
understanding
i
did
it
and
after
a
little
he
had
the
idea
and
he
brought
his
fist
down
and
said
he
didnt
believe
a
nation
where
every
man
had
a
vote
would
voluntarily
get
down
in
the
mud
and
dirt
in
any
such
way
and
that
to
steal
from
a
nation
its
will
and
preference
must
be
a
crime
and
the
first
of
all
crimes
i
said
to
myself
this
ones
a
man
if
i
were
backed
by
enough
of
his
sort
i
would
make
a
strike
for
the
welfare
of
this
country
and
try
to
prove
myself
its
loyalest
citizen
by
making
a
wholesome
change
in
its
system
of
government
you
see
my
kind
of
loyalty
was
loyalty
to
ones
country
not
to
its
institutions
or
its
officeholders
the
country
is
the
real
thing
the
substantial
thing
the
eternal
thing
it
is
the
thing
to
watch
over
and
care
for
and
be
loyal
to
institutions
are
extraneous
they
are
its
mere
clothing
and
clothing
can
wear
out
become
ragged
cease
to
be
comfortable
cease
to
protect
the
body
from
winter
disease
and
death
to
be
loyal
to
rags
to
shout
for
rags
to
worship
rags
to
die
for
ragsthat
is
a
loyalty
of
unreason
it
is
pure
animal
it
belongs
to
monarchy
was
invented
by
monarchy
let
monarchy
keep
it
i
was
from
connecticut
whose
constitution
declares
that
all
political
power
is
inherent
in
the
people
and
all
free
governments
are
founded
on
their
authority
and
instituted
for
their
benefit
and
that
they
have
at
all
times
an
undeniable
and
indefeasible
right
to
alter
their
form
of
government
in
such
a
manner
as
they
may
think
expedient
under
that
gospel
the
citizen
who
thinks
he
sees
that
the
commonwealths
political
clothes
are
worn
out
and
yet
holds
his
peace
and
does
not
agitate
for
a
new
suit
is
disloyal
he
is
a
traitor
that
he
may
be
the
only
one
who
thinks
he
sees
this
decay
does
not
excuse
him
it
is
his
duty
to
agitate
anyway
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
others
to
vote
him
down
if
they
do
not
see
the
matter
as
he
does
and
now
here
i
was
in
a
country
where
a
right
to
say
how
the
country
should
be
governed
was
restricted
to
six
persons
in
each
thousand
of
its
population
for
the
nine
hundred
and
ninetyfour
to
express
dissatisfaction
with
the
regnant
system
and
propose
to
change
it
would
have
made
the
whole
six
shudder
as
one
man
it
would
have
been
so
disloyal
so
dishonorable
such
putrid
black
treason
so
to
speak
i
was
become
a
stockholder
in
a
corporation
where
nine
hundred
and
ninetyfour
of
the
members
furnished
all
the
money
and
did
all
the
work
and
the
other
six
elected
themselves
a
permanent
board
of
direction
and
took
all
the
dividends
it
seemed
to
me
that
what
the
nine
hundred
and
ninetyfour
dupes
needed
was
a
new
deal
the
thing
that
would
have
best
suited
the
circus
side
of
my
nature
would
have
been
to
resign
the
bossship
and
get
up
an
insurrection
and
turn
it
into
a
revolution
but
i
knew
that
the
jack
cade
or
the
wat
tyler
who
tries
such
a
thing
without
first
educating
his
materials
up
to
revolution
grade
is
almost
absolutely
certain
to
get
left
i
had
never
been
accustomed
to
getting
left
even
if
i
do
say
it
myself
wherefore
the
deal
which
had
been
for
some
time
working
into
shape
in
my
mind
was
of
a
quite
different
pattern
from
the
cadetyler
sort
so
i
did
not
talk
blood
and
insurrection
to
that
man
there
who
sat
munching
black
bread
with
that
abused
and
mistaught
herd
of
human
sheep
but
took
him
aside
and
talked
matter
of
another
sort
to
him
after
i
had
finished
i
got
him
to
lend
me
a
little
ink
from
his
veins
and
with
this
and
a
sliver
i
wrote
on
a
piece
of
bark
put
him
in
the
manfactory
and
gave
it
to
him
and
said
take
it
to
the
palace
at
camelot
and
give
it
into
the
hands
of
amyas
le
poulet
whom
i
call
clarence
and
he
will
understand
he
is
a
priest
then
said
the
man
and
some
of
the
enthusiasm
went
out
of
his
face
howa
priest
didnt
i
tell
you
that
no
chattel
of
the
church
no
bondslave
of
pope
or
bishop
can
enter
my
manfactory
didnt
i
tell
you
that
you
couldnt
enter
unless
your
religion
whatever
it
might
be
was
your
own
free
property
marry
it
is
so
and
for
that
i
was
glad
wherefore
it
liked
me
not
and
bred
in
me
a
cold
doubt
to
hear
of
this
priest
being
there
but
he
isnt
a
priest
i
tell
you
the
man
looked
far
from
satisfied
he
said
he
is
not
a
priest
and
yet
can
read
he
is
not
a
priest
and
yet
can
readyes
and
write
too
for
that
matter
i
taught
him
myself
the
mans
face
cleared
and
it
is
the
first
thing
that
you
yourself
will
be
taught
in
that
factory
i
i
would
give
blood
out
of
my
heart
to
know
that
art
why
i
will
be
your
slave
your
no
you
wont
you
wont
be
anybodys

your
family
and
go
along
your
lord
the
bishop
will
confiscate
your
small
property
but
no

you
all
right
chapter
xiv
defend
thee
lord
i
paid
three
pennies
for
my
breakfast
and
a
most
extravagant
price
it
was
too
seeing
that
one
could
have
breakfasted
a
dozen
persons
for
that
money
but
i
was
feeling
good
by
this
time
and
i
had
always
been
a
kind
of
spendthrift
anyway
and
then
these
people
had
wanted
to
give
me
the
food
for
nothing
scant
as
their
provision
was
and
so
it
was
a
grateful
pleasure
to
emphasize
my
appreciation
and
sincere
thankfulness
with
a
good
big
financial
lift
where
the
money
would
do
so
much
more
good
than
it
would
in
my
helmet
where
these
pennies
being
made
of
iron
and
not
stinted
in
weight
my
halfdollars
worth
was
a
good
deal
of
a
burden
to
me
i
spent
money
rather
too
freely
in
those
days
it
is
true
but
one
reason
for
it
was
that
i
hadnt
got
the
proportions
of
things
entirely
adjusted
even
yet
after
so
long
a
sojourn
in
britainhadnt
got
along
to
where
i
was
able
to
absolutely
realize
that
a
penny
in
arthurs
land
and
a
couple
of
dollars
in
connecticut
were
about
one
and
the
same
thing
just
twins
as
you
may
say
in
purchasing
power
if
my
start
from
camelot
could
have
been
delayed
a
very
few
days
i
could
have
paid
these
people
in
beautiful
new
coins
from
our
own
mint
and
that
would
have
pleased
me
and
them
too
not
less
i
had
adopted
the
american
values
exclusively
in
a
week
or
two
now
cents
nickels
dimes
quarters
and
halfdollars
and
also
a
trifle
of
gold
would
be
trickling
in
thin
but
steady
streams
all
through
the
commercial
veins
of
the
kingdom
and
i
looked
to
see
this
new
blood
freshen
up
its
life
the
farmers
were
bound
to
throw
in
something
to
sort
of
offset
my
liberality
whether
i
would
or
no
so
i
let
them
give
me
a
flint
and
steel
and
as
soon
as
they
had
comfortably
bestowed
sandy
and
me
on
our
horse
i
lit
my
pipe
when
the
first
blast
of
smoke
shot
out
through
the
bars
of
my
helmet
all
those
people
broke
for
the
woods
and
sandy
went
over
backwards
and
struck
the
ground
with
a
dull
thud
they
thought
i
was
one
of
those
firebelching
dragons
they
had
heard
so
much
about
from
knights
and
other
professional
liars
i
had
infinite
trouble
to
persuade
those
people
to
venture
back
within
explaining
distance
then
i
told
them
that
this
was
only
a
bit
of
enchantment
which
would
work
harm
to
none
but
my
enemies
and
i
promised
with
my
hand
on
my
heart
that
if
all
who
felt
no
enmity
toward
me
would
come
forward
and
pass
before
me
they
should
see
that
only
those
who
remained
behind
would
be
struck
dead
the
procession
moved
with
a
good
deal
of
promptness
there
were
no
casualties
to
report
for
nobody
had
curiosity
enough
to
remain
behind
to
see
what
would
happen
i
lost
some
time
now
for
these
big
children
their
fears
gone
became
so
ravished
with
wonder
over
my
awecompelling
fireworks
that
i
had
to
stay
there
and
smoke
a
couple
of
pipes
out
before
they
would
let
me
go
still
the
delay
was
not
wholly
unproductive
for
it
took
all
that
time
to
get
sandy
thoroughly
wonted
to
the
new
thing
she
being
so
close
to
it
you
know
it
plugged
up
her
conversation
mill
too
for
a
considerable
while
and
that
was
a
gain
but
above
all
other
benefits
accruing
i
had
learned
something
i
was
ready
for
any
giant
or
any
ogre
that
might
come
along
now
we
tarried
with
a
holy
hermit
that
night
and
my
opportunity
came
about
the
middle
of
the
next
afternoon
we
were
crossing
a
vast
meadow
by
way
of
shortcut
and
i
was
musing
absently
hearing
nothing
seeing
nothing
when
sandy
suddenly
interrupted
a
remark
which
she
had
begun
that
morning
with
the
cry
defend
thee
lordperil
of
life
is
toward
and
she
slipped
down
from
the
horse
and
ran
a
little
way
and
stood
i
looked
up
and
saw
far
off
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
half
a
dozen
armed
knights
and
their
squires
and
straightway
there
was
bustle
among
them
and
tightening
of
saddlegirths
for
the
mount
my
pipe
was
ready
and
would
have
been
lit
if
i
had
not
been
lost
in
thinking
about
how
to
banish
oppression
from
this
land
and
restore
to
all
its
people
their
stolen
rights
and
manhood
without
disobliging
anybody
i
lit
up
at
once
and
by
the
time
i
had
got
a
good
head
of
reserved
steam
on
here
they
came
all
together
too
none
of
those
chivalrous
magnanimities
which
one
reads
so
much
about
one
courtly
rascal
at
a
time
and
the
rest
standing
by
to
see
fair
play
no
they
came
in
a
body
they
came
with
a
whirr
and
a
rush
they
came
like
a
volley
from
a
battery
came
with
heads
low
down
plumes
streaming
out
behind
lances
advanced
at
a
level
it
was
a
handsome
sight
a
beautiful
sightfor
a
man
up
a
tree
i
laid
my
lance
in
rest
and
waited
with
my
heart
beating
till
the
iron
wave
was
just
ready
to
break
over
me
then
spouted
a
column
of
white
smoke
through
the
bars
of
my
helmet
you
should
have
seen
the
wave
go
to
pieces
and
scatter
this
was
a
finer
sight
than
the
other
one
but
these
people
stopped
two
or
three
hundred
yards
away
and
this
troubled
me
my
satisfaction
collapsed
and
fear
came
i
judged
i
was
a
lost
man
but
sandy
was
radiant
and
was
going
to
be
eloquentbut
i
stopped
her
and
told
her
my
magic
had
miscarried
somehow
or
other
and
she
must
mount
with
all
despatch
and
we
must
ride
for
life
no
she
wouldnt
she
said
that
my
enchantment
had
disabled
those
knights
they
were
not
riding
on
because
they
couldnt
wait
they
would
drop
out
of
their
saddles
presently
and
we
would
get
their
horses
and
harness
i
could
not
deceive
such
trusting
simplicity
so
i
said
it
was
a
mistake
that
when
my
fireworks
killed
at
all
they
killed
instantly
no
the
men
would
not
die
there
was
something
wrong
about
my
apparatus
i
couldnt
tell
what
but
we
must
hurry
and
get
away
for
those
people
would
attack
us
again
in
a
minute
sandy
laughed
and
said
lackaday
sir
they
be
not
of
that
breed
sir
launcelot
will
give
battle
to
dragons
and
will
abide
by
them
and
will
assail
them
again
and
yet
again
and
still
again
until
he
do
conquer
and
destroy
them
and
so
likewise
will
sir
pellinore
and
sir
aglovale
and
sir
carados
and
mayhap
others
but
there
be
none
else
that
will
venture
it
let
the
idle
say
what
the
idle
will
and
la
as
to
yonder
base
rufflers
think
ye
they
have
not
their
fill
but
yet
desire
more
well
then
what
are
they
waiting
for
why
dont
they
leave
nobodys
hindering
good
land
im
willing
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
im
sure
leave
is
it
oh
give
thyself
easement
as
to
that
they
dream
not
of
it
no
not
they
they
wait
to
yield
them
comereally
is
that
soothas
you
people
say
if
they
want
to
why
dont
they
it
would
like
them
much
but
an
ye
wot
how
dragons
are
esteemed
ye
would
not
hold
them
blamable
they
fear
to
come
well
then
suppose
i
go
to
them
instead
and
ah
wit
ye
well
they
would
not
abide
your
coming
i
will
go
and
she
did
she
was
a
handy
person
to
have
along
on
a
raid
i
would
have
considered
this
a
doubtful
errand
myself
i
presently
saw
the
knights
riding
away
and
sandy
coming
back
that
was
a
relief
i
judged
she
had
somehow
failed
to
get
the
first
innings
i
mean
in
the
conversation
otherwise
the
interview
wouldnt
have
been
so
short
but
it
turned
out
that
she
had
managed
the
business
well
in
fact
admirably
she
said
that
when
she
told
those
people
i
was
the
boss
it
hit
them
where
they
lived
smote
them
sore
with
fear
and
dread
was
her
word
and
then
they
were
ready
to
put
up
with
anything
she
might
require
so
she
swore
them
to
appear
at
arthurs
court
within
two
days
and
yield
them
with
horse
and
harness
and
be
my
knights
henceforth
and
subject
to
my
command
how
much
better
she
managed
that
thing
than
i
should
have
done
it
myself
she
was

so
im
proprietor
of
some

said
i
as
we
rode
off
who
would
ever
have
supposed
that
i
should
live
to
list
up
assets
of
that
sort
i
shant
know
what

of

yes
where

ah
i
understood
thee
not
that
will
i
tell
eftsoons
then
she
said
musingly
and
softly
turning
the
words
daintily
over
her
tongue
hang
they
outhang
they
outwhere

do
they

eh
right
so
where

they
hang
out
of
a
truth
the
phrase
hath
a
fair
and
winsome
grace
and
is
prettily
worded
withal

will
repeat
it
anon
and
anon
in
mine

whereby
i
may
peradventure
learn
it
where
do
they
hang
out
even
so
already
it
falleth
trippingly
from
my
tongue
and
forasmuch
as
dont
forget
the
cowboys
sandy
cowboys
yes
the
knights
you
know
you
were
going
to
tell
me
about
them
a
while
back
you
remember
figuratively
speaking
games
called
game
yes
yes
yes
go
to
the
bat
i
mean
get
to
work
on
your
statistics
and
dont
burn
so
much
kindling
getting
your
fire
started
tell
me
about
the
knights
i
will
well
and
lightly
will
begin
so
they
two
departed
and
rode
into
a
great
forest
and
great
scott
you
see
i
recognized
my
mistake
at
once
i
had
set
her
works
agoing
it
was
my
own
fault
she
would
be
thirty
days
getting
down
to
those
facts
and
she
generally
began
without
a
preface
and
finished
without
a
result
if
you
interrupted
her
she
would
either
go
right
along
without
noticing
or
answer
with
a
couple
of
words
and
go
back
and
say
the
sentence
over
again
so
interruptions
only
did
harm
and
yet
i
had
to
interrupt
and
interrupt
pretty
frequently
too
in
order
to
save
my
life
a
person
would
die
if
he
let
her
monotony
drip
on
him
right
along
all
day
great
scott
i
said
in
my
distress
she
went
right
back
and
began
over
again
so
they
two
departed
and
rode
into
a
great
forest
and
which
two
sir
gawaine
and
sir
uwaine
and
so
they
came
to
an
abbey
of
monks
and
there
were
well
lodged
so
on
the
morn
they
heard
their
masses
in
the
abbey
and
so
they
rode
forth
till
they
came
to
a
great
forest
then
was
sir
gawaine
ware
in
a
valley
by
a
turret
of
twelve
fair
damsels
and
two
knights
armed
on
great
horses
and
the
damsels
went
to
and
fro
by
a
tree
and
then
was
sir
gawaine
ware
how
there
hung
a
white
shield
on
that
tree
and
ever
as
the
damsels
came
by
it
they
spit
upon
it
and
some
threw
mire
upon
the
shield
now
if
i
hadnt
seen
the
like
myself
in
this
country
sandy
i
wouldnt
believe
it
but
ive
seen
it
and
i
can
just
see
those
creatures
now
parading
before
that
shield
and
acting
like
that
the
women
here
do
certainly
act
like
all
possessed
yes
and
i
mean
your
best
too
societys
very
choicest
brands
the
humblest
hellogirl
along
ten
thousand
miles
of
wire
could
teach
gentleness
patience
modesty
manners
to
the
highest
duchess
in
arthurs
land
hellogirl
yes
but
dont
you
ask
me
to
explain
its
a
new
kind
of
a
girl
they
dont
have
them
here
one
often
speaks
sharply
to
them
when
they
are
not
the
least
in
fault
and
he
cant
get
over
feeling
sorry
for
it
and
ashamed
of
himself
in
thirteen
hundred
years
its
such
shabby
mean
conduct
and
so
unprovoked
the
fact
is
no
gentleman
ever
does
itthough
iwell
i
myself
if
ive
got
to
confess
peradventure
she
never
mind
her
never
mind
her
i
tell
you
i
couldnt
ever
explain
her
so
you
would
understand
even
so
be
it
sith
ye
are
so
minded
then
sir
gawaine
and
sir
uwaine
went
and
saluted
them
and
asked
them
why
they
did
that
despite
to
the
shield
sirs
said
the
damsels
we
shall
tell
you
there
is
a
knight
in
this
country
that
owneth
this
white
shield
and
he
is
a
passing
good
man
of
his
hands
but
he
hateth
all
ladies
and
gentlewomen
and
therefore
we
do
all
this
despite
to
the
shield
i
will
say
you
said
sir
gawaine
it
beseemeth
evil
a
good
knight
to
despise
all
ladies
and
gentlewomen
and
peradventure
though
he
hate
you
he
hath
some
cause
and
peradventure
he
loveth
in
some
other
places
ladies
and
gentlewomen
and
to
be
loved
again
and
he
such
a
man
of
prowess
as
ye
speak
of
man
of
prowessyes
that
is
the
man
to
please
them
sandy
man
of
brainsthat
is
a
thing
they
never
think
of
tom
sayers
john
heenanjohn
l
sullivanpity
but
you
could
be
here
you
would
have
your
legs
under
the
round
table
and
a
sir
in
front
of
your
names
within
the
twentyfour
hours
and
you
could
bring
about
a
new
distribution
of
the
married
princesses
and
duchesses
of
the
court
in
another
twentyfour
the
fact
is
it
is
just
a
sort
of
polishedup
court
of
comanches
and
there
isnt
a
squaw
in
it
who
doesnt
stand
ready
at
the
dropping
of
a
hat
to
desert
to
the
buck
with
the
biggest
string
of
scalps
at
his
belt
and
he
be
such
a
man
of
prowess
as
ye
speak
of
said
sir
gawaine
now
what
is
his
name
sir
said
they
his
name
is
marhaus
the
kings
son
of
ireland
son
of
the
king
of
ireland
you
mean
the
other
form
doesnt
mean
anything
and
look
out
and
hold
on
tight
now
we
must
jump
this
gully
there
we
are
all
right
now
this
horse
belongs
in
the
circus
he
is
born
before
his
time
i
know
him
well
said
sir
uwaine
he
is
a
passing
good
knight
as
any
is
on
live
on
live
if
youve
got
a
fault
in
the
world
sandy
it
is
that
you
are
a
shade
too
archaic
but
it
isnt
any
matter
for
i
saw
him
once
proved
at
a
justs
where
many
knights
were
gathered
and
that
time
there
might
no
man
withstand
him
ah
said
sir
gawaine
damsels
methinketh
ye
are
to
blame
for
it
is
to
suppose
he
that
hung
that
shield
there
will
not
be
long
therefrom
and
then
may
those
knights
match
him
on
horseback
and
that
is
more
your
worship
than
thus
for
i
will
abide
no
longer
to
see
a
knights
shield
dishonored
and
therewith
sir
uwaine
and
sir
gawaine
departed
a
little
from
them
and
then
were
they
ware
where
sir
marhaus
came
riding
on
a
great
horse
straight
toward
them
and
when
the
twelve
damsels
saw
sir
marhaus
they
fled
into
the
turret
as
they
were
wild
so
that
some
of
them
fell
by
the
way
then
the
one
of
the
knights
of
the
tower
dressed
his
shield
and
said
on
high
sir
marhaus
defend
thee
and
so
they
ran
together
that
the
knight
brake
his
spear
on
marhaus
and
sir
marhaus
smote
him
so
hard
that
he
brake
his
neck
and
the
horses
back
well
that
is
just
the
trouble
about
this
state
of
things
it
ruins
so
many
horses
that
saw
the
other
knight
of
the
turret
and
dressed
him
toward
marhaus
and
they
went
so
eagerly
together
that
the
knight
of
the
turret
was
soon
smitten
down
horse
and
man
stark
dead
another
horse
gone
i
tell
you
it
is
a
custom
that
ought
to
be
broken
up
i
dont
see
how
people
with
any
feeling
can
applaud
and
support
it




so
these
two
knights
came
together
with
great
random
i
saw
that
i
had
been
asleep
and
missed
a
chapter
but
i
didnt
say
anything
i
judged
that
the
irish
knight
was
in
trouble
with
the
visitors
by
this
time
and
this
turned
out
to
be
the
case
that
sir
uwaine
smote
sir
marhaus
that
his
spear
brast
in
pieces
on
the
shield
and
sir
marhaus
smote
him
so
sore
that
horse
and
man
he
bare
to
the
earth
and
hurt
sir
uwaine
on
the
left
side
the
truth
is
alisande
these
archaics
are
a
little
too
simple
the
vocabulary
is
too
limited
and
so
by
consequence
descriptions
suffer
in
the
matter
of
variety
they
run
too
much
to
level
saharas
of
fact
and
not
enough
to
picturesque
detail
this
throws
about
them
a
certain
air
of
the
monotonous
in
fact
the
fights
are
all
alike
a
couple
of
people
come
together
with
great
random
random
is
a
good
word
and
so
is
exegesis
for
that
matter
and
so
is
holocaust
and
defalcation
and
usufruct
and
a
hundred
others
but
land
a
body
ought
to
discriminatethey
come
together
with
great
random
and
a
spear
is
brast
and
one
party
brake
his
shield
and
the
other
one
goes
down
horse
and
man
over
his
horsetail

sir

turned
his
horse
and
rode
toward
gawaine
with
his
spear
and
when
sir
gawaine
saw
that
he
dressed
his
shield
and
they
aventred
their
spears
and
they
came
together
with
all
the
might
of
their
horses
that
either
knight
smote
other
so
hard
in

therewith

rushed
down
to

brake
his
back
and
lightly
sir
gawaine
rose
upon
his
feet
and
pulled
out
his
sword
and
dressed
him
toward
sir
marhaus
on
foot
and
therewith
either
came
unto
other
eagerly
and
smote
together
with
their
swords
that
their
shields
flew
in
cantels
and
they
bruised
their
helms

their

wounded

stronger
and

increased
all
this
espied
sir
marhaus
and
had
great
wonder
how
his
might
increased
and
so
they
wounded
other
passing
sore
and
then
when
it
was
come
noon
the

and
waxed
passing
faint
that
unnethes
he
might

and
sir
marhaus
was
then
bigger
and
bigger
which
strained
his
armor
of
course
and
yet
little
would
one
of
these
people
mind
a
small
thing
like
that
and
so
sir
knight
said
sir
marhaus
i
have
well
felt
that
ye
are
a
passing
good
knight
and
a
marvelous
man
of
might
as
ever
i
felt
any
while
it
lasteth
and
our
quarrels
are
not
great
and
therefore
it
were
a
pity
to
do
you
hurt
for
i
feel
you
are
passing
feeble
ah
said
sir
gawaine
gentle
knight
ye
say
the
word
that
i
should
say
and
therewith
they
took
off
their
helms
and
either
kissed
other
and
there
they
swore
together
either
to
love
other
as
brethren
but
i
lost
the
thread
there
and
dozed
off
to
slumber
thinking
about
what
a
pity
it
was
that
men
with
such
superb
strength
strength
enabling
them
to
stand
up
cased
in
cruelly
burdensome
iron
and
drenched
with
perspiration
and
hack
and
batter
and
bang
each
other
for
six
hours
on
a
stretchshould
not
have
been
born
at
a
time
when
they
could
put
it
to
some
useful
purpose
take
a
jackass
for
instance
a
jackass
has
that
kind
of
strength
and
puts
it
to
a
useful
purpose
and
is
valuable
to
this
world
because
he
is
a
jackass
but
a
nobleman
is
not
valuable
because
he
is
a
jackass
it
is
a
mixture
that
is
always
ineffectual
and
should
never
have
been
attempted
in
the
first
place
and
yet
once
you
start
a
mistake
the
trouble
is
done
and
you
never
know
what
is
going
to
come
of
it
when
i
came
to
myself
again
and
began
to
listen
i
perceived
that
i
had
lost
another
chapter
and
that
alisande
had
wandered
a
long
way
off
with
her
people
and
so
they
rode
and
came
into
a
deep
valley
full
of
stones
and
thereby
they
saw
a
fair
stream
of
water
above
thereby
was
the
head
of
the
stream
a
fair
fountain
and
three
damsels
sitting
thereby
in
this
country
said
sir
marhaus
came
never
knight
since
it
was
christened
but
he
found
strange
adventures
this
is
not
good
form
alisande
sir
marhaus
the
kings
son
of
ireland
talks
like
all
the
rest
you
ought
to
give
him
a
brogue
or
at
least
a
characteristic
expletive
by
this
means
one
would
recognize
him
as
soon
as
he
spoke
without
his
ever
being
named
it
is
a
common
literary
device
with
the
great
authors
you
should
make

you
see
how
much
better
that
sounds
came
never

but
he
found
strange
adventures
be
jabers
of
a
truth
it

indeed
fair

albeit
tis
passing
hard
to
say
though
peradventure
that
will
not
tarry
but
better
speed
with
usage
and
then
they
rode
to
the
damsels
and
either
saluted
other
and
the
eldest
had
a
garland
of
gold
about
her
head
and
she
was
threescore
winter
of
age
or
more
the
damsel
was
even
so
dear
lordand
her
hair
was
white
under
the
garland

teeth
nine

like
as

up
and
down
like
a
portcullis
when
you
eat
and
fall
out
when
you
laugh
the
second
damsel
was
of
thirty
winter
of
age
with
a
circlet
of
gold
about
her
head
the
third
damsel
was
but
fifteen
year
of
age
billows
of
thought
came
rolling
over
my
soul
and
the
voice
faded
out
of
my
hearing
fifteen
breakmy
heart
oh
my
lost
darling
just
her
age
who
was
so
gentle
and
lovely
and
all
the
world
to
me
and
whom
i
shall
never
see
again
how
the
thought
of
her
carries
me
back
over
wide
seas
of
memory
to
a
vague
dim
time
a
happy
time
so
many
many
centuries
hence
when
i
used
to
wake
in
the
soft
summer
mornings
out
of
sweet
dreams
of
her
and
say
hello
central
just
to
hear
her
dear
voice
come
melting
back
to
me
with
a
hello
hank
that
was
music
of
the
spheres
to
my
enchanted
ear
she
got
three
dollars
a
week
but
she
was
worth
it
i
could
not
follow
alisandes
further
explanation
of
who
our
captured
knights
were
nowi
mean
in
case
she
should
ever
get
to
explaining
who
they
were
my
interest
was
gone
my
thoughts
were
far
away
and
sad
by
fitful
glimpses
of
the
drifting
tale
caught
here
and
there
and
now
and
then
i
merely
noted
in
a
vague
way
that
each
of
these
three
knights
took
one
of
these
three
damsels
up
behind
him
on
his
horse
and
one
rode
north
another
east
the
other
south
to
seek
adventures
and
meet
again
and
lie
after
year
and
day
year
and
dayand
without
baggage
it
was
of
a
piece
with
the
general
simplicity
of
the
country
the
sun
was
now
setting
it
was
about
three
in
the
afternoon
when
alisande
had
begun
to
tell
me
who
the
cowboys
were
so
she
had
made
pretty
good
progress
with
itfor
her
she
would
arrive
some
time
or
other
no
doubt
but
she
was
not
a
person
who
could
be
hurried
we
were
approaching
a
castle
which
stood
on
high
ground
a
huge
strong
venerable
structure
whose
gray
towers
and
battlements
were
charmingly
draped
with
ivy
and
whose
whole
majestic
mass
was
drenched
with
splendors
flung
from
the
sinking
sun
it
was
the
largest
castle
we
had
seen
and
so
i
thought
it
might
be
the
one
we
were
after
but
sandy
said
no
she
did
not
know
who
owned
it
she
said
she
had
passed
it
without
calling
when
she
went
down
to
camelot
chapter
xvi
morgan
le
fay
if
knights
errant
were
to
be
believed
not
all
castles
were
desirable
places
to
seek
hospitality
in
as
a
matter
of
fact
knights
errant
were
not
persons
to
be
believedthat
is
measured
by
modern
standards
of
veracity
yet
measured
by
the
standards
of
their
own
time
and
scaled
accordingly
you
got
the
truth
it
was
very
simple
you
discounted
a
statement
ninetyseven
per
cent
the
rest
was
fact
now
after
making
this
allowance
the
truth
remained
that
if
i
could
find
out
something
about
a
castle
before
ringing
the
doorbelli
mean
hailing
the
wardersit
was
the
sensible
thing
to
do
so
i
was
pleased
when
i
saw
in
the
distance
a
horseman
making
the
bottom
turn
of
the
road
that
wound
down
from
this
castle
as
we
approached
each
other
i
saw
that
he
wore
a
plumed
helmet
and
seemed
to
be
otherwise
clothed
in
steel
but
bore
a
curious
addition
alsoa
stiff
square
garment
like
a
heralds
tabard
however
i
had
to
smile
at
my
own
forgetfulness
when
i
got
nearer
and
read
this
sign
on
his
tabard
persimmons
soap

all
the
primedonna
use
it
that
was
a
little
idea
of
my
own
and
had
several
wholesome
purposes
in
view
toward
the
civilizing
and
uplifting
of
this
nation
in
the
first
place
it
was
a
furtive
underhand
blow
at
this
nonsense
of
knight
errantry
though
nobody
suspected
that
but
me
i
had
started
a
number
of
these
people
outthe
bravest
knights
i
could
geteach
sandwiched
between
bulletinboards
bearing
one
device
or
another
and
i
judged
that
by
and
by
when
they
got
to
be
numerous
enough
they
would
begin
to
look
ridiculous
and
then
even
the
steelclad
ass
that
hadnt
any
board
would
himself
begin
to
look
ridiculous
because
he
was
out
of
the
fashion
secondly
these
missionaries
would
gradually
and
without
creating
suspicion
or
exciting
alarm
introduce
a
rudimentary
cleanliness
among
the
nobility
and
from
them
it
would
work
down
to
the
people
if
the
priests
could
be
kept
quiet
this
would
undermine
the
church
i
mean
would
be
a
step
toward
that
next
educationnext
freedom
and
then
she
would
begin
to
crumble
it
being
my
conviction
that
any
established
church
is
an
established
crime
an
established
slavepen
i
had
no
scruples
but
was
willing
to
assail
it
in
any
way
or
with
any
weapon
that
promised
to
hurt
it
why
in
my
own
former
dayin
remote
centuries
not
yet
stirring
in
the
womb
of
timethere
were
old
englishmen
who
imagined
that
they
had
been
born
in
a
free
country
a
free
country
with
the
corporation
act
and
the
test
still
in
force
in
ittimbers
propped
against
mens
liberties
and
dishonored
consciences
to
shore
up
an
established
anachronism
with
my
missionaries
were
taught
to
spell
out
the
gilt
signs
on
their
tabardsthe
showy
gilding
was
a
neat
idea
i
could
have
got
the
king
to
wear
a
bulletinboard
for
the
sake
of
that
barbaric
splendorthey
were
to
spell
out
these
signs
and
then
explain
to
the
lords
and
ladies
what
soap
was
and
if
the
lords
and
ladies
were
afraid
of
it
get
them
to
try
it
on
a
dog
the
missionarys
next
move
was
to
get
the
family
together
and
try
it
on
himself
he
was
to
stop
at
no
experiment
however
desperate
that
could
convince
the
nobility
that
soap
was
harmless
if
any
final
doubt
remained
he
must
catch
a
hermitthe
woods
were
full
of
them
saints
they
called
themselves
and
saints
they
were
believed
to
be
they
were
unspeakably
holy
and
worked
miracles
and
everybody
stood
in
awe
of
them
if
a
hermit
could
survive
a
wash
and
that
failed
to
convince
a
duke
give
him
up
let
him
alone
whenever
my
missionaries
overcame
a
knight
errant
on
the
road
they
washed
him
and
when
he
got
well
they
swore
him
to
go
and
get
a
bulletinboard
and
disseminate
soap
and
civilization
the
rest
of
his
days
as
a
consequence
the
workers
in
the
field
were
increasing
by
degrees
and
the
reform
was
steadily
spreading
my
soap
factory
felt
the
strain
early
at
first
i
had
only
two
hands
but
before
i
had
left
home
i
was
already
employing
fifteen
and
running
night
and
day
and
the
atmospheric
result
was
getting
so
pronounced
that
the
king
went
sort
of
fainting
and
gasping
around
and
said
he
did
not
believe
he
could
stand
it
much
longer
and
sir
launcelot
got
so
that
he
did
hardly
anything
but
walk
up
and
down
the
roof
and
swear
although
i
told
him
it
was
worse
up
there
than
anywhere
else
but
he
said
he
wanted
plenty
of
air
and
he
was
always
complaining
that
a
palace
was
no
place
for
a
soap
factory
anyway
and
said
if
a
man
was
to
start
one
in
his
house
he
would
be
damned
if
he
wouldnt
strangle
him
there
were
ladies
present
too
but
much
these
people
ever
cared
for
that
they
would
swear
before
children
if
the
wind
was
their
way
when
the
factory
was
going
this
missionary
knights
name
was
la
cote
male
taile
and
he
said
that
this
castle
was
the
abode
of
morgan
le
fay
sister
of
king
arthur
and
wife
of
king
uriens
monarch
of
a
realm
about
as
big
as
the
district
of
columbiayou
could
stand
in
the
middle
of
it
and
throw
bricks
into
the
next
kingdom
kings
and
kingdoms
were
as
thick
in
britain
as
they
had
been
in
little
palestine
in
joshuas
time
when
people
had
to
sleep
with
their
knees
pulled
up
because
they
couldnt
stretch
out
without
a
passport
la
cote
was
much
depressed
for
he
had
scored
here
the
worst
failure
of
his
campaign
he
had
not
worked
off
a
cake
yet
he
had
tried
all
the
tricks
of
the
trade
even
to
the
washing
of
a
hermit
but
the
hermit
died
this
was
indeed
a
bad
failure
for
this
animal
would
now
be
dubbed
a
martyr
and
would
take
his
place
among
the
saints
of
the
roman
calendar
thus
made
he
his
moan
this
poor
sir
la
cote
male
taile
and
sorrowed
passing
sore
and
so
my
heart
bled
for
him
and
i
was
moved
to
comfort
and
stay
him
wherefore
i
said
forbear
to
grieve
fair
knight
for
this
is
not
a
defeat
we
have
brains
you
and
i
and
for
such
as
have
brains
there
are
no
defeats
but
only
victories
observe
how
we
will
turn
this
seeming
disaster
into
an
advertisement
an
advertisement
for
our
soap
and
the
biggest
one
to
draw
that
was
ever
thought
of
an
advertisement
that
will
transform
that
mount
washington
defeat
into
a
matterhorn
victory
we
will
put
on
your
bulletinboard
patronized
by
the
elect
how
does
that
strike
you
verily
it
is
wonderly
bethought
well
a
body
is
bound
to
admit
that
for
just
a
modest
little
oneline
ad
its
a
corker
so
the
poor
colporteurs
griefs
vanished
away
he
was
a
brave
fellow
and
had
done
mighty
feats
of
arms
in
his
time
his
chief
celebrity
rested
upon
the
events
of
an
excursion
like
this
one
of
mine
which
he
had
once
made
with
a
damsel
named
maledisant
who
was
as
handy
with
her
tongue
as
was
sandy
though
in
a
different
way
for
her
tongue
churned
forth
only
railings
and
insult
whereas
sandys
music
was
of
a
kindlier
sort
i
knew
his
story
well
and
so
i
knew
how
to
interpret
the
compassion
that
was
in
his
face
when
he
bade
me
farewell
he
supposed
i
was
having
a
bitter
hard
time
of
it
sandy
and
i
discussed
his
story
as
we
rode
along
and
she
said
that
la
cotes
bad
luck
had
begun
with
the
very
beginning
of
that
trip
for
the
kings
fool
had
overthrown
him
on
the
first
day
and
in
such
cases
it
was
customary
for
the
girl
to
desert
to
the
conqueror
but
maledisant
didnt
do
it
and
also
persisted
afterward
in
sticking
to
him
after
all
his
defeats
but
said
i
suppose
the
victor
should
decline
to
accept
his
spoil
she
said
that
that
wouldnt
answerhe
must
he
couldnt
decline
it
wouldnt
be
regular
i
made
a
note
of
that
if
sandys
music
got
to
be
too
burdensome
some
time
i
would
let
a
knight
defeat
me
on
the
chance
that
she
would
desert
to
him
in
due
time
we
were
challenged
by
the
warders
from
the
castle
walls
and
after
a
parley
admitted
i
have
nothing
pleasant
to
tell
about
that
visit
but
it
was
not
a
disappointment
for
i
knew
mrs
le
fay
by
reputation
and
was
not
expecting
anything
pleasant
she
was
held
in
awe
by
the
whole
realm
for
she
had
made
everybody
believe
she
was
a
great
sorceress
all
her
ways
were
wicked
all
her
instincts
devilish
she
was
loaded
to
the
eyelids
with
cold
malice
all
her
history
was
black
with
crime
and
among
her
crimes
murder
was
common
i
was
most
curious
to
see
her
as
curious
as
i
could
have
been
to
see
satan
to
my
surprise
she
was
beautiful
black
thoughts
had
failed
to
make
her
expression
repulsive
age
had
failed
to
wrinkle
her
satin
skin
or
mar
its
bloomy
freshness
she
could
have
passed
for
old
uriens
granddaughter
she
could
have
been
mistaken
for
sister
to
her
own
son
as
soon
as
we
were
fairly
within
the
castle
gates
we
were
ordered
into
her
presence
king
uriens
was
there
a
kindfaced
old
man
with
a
subdued
look
and
also
the
son
sir
uwaine
le
blanchemains
in
whom
i
was
of
course
interested
on
account
of
the
tradition
that
he
had
once
done
battle
with
thirty
knights
and
also
on
account
of
his
trip
with
sir
gawaine
and
sir
marhaus
which
sandy
had
been
aging
me
with
but
morgan
was
the
main
attraction
the
conspicuous
personality
here
she
was
head
chief
of
this
household
that
was
plain
she
caused
us
to
be
seated
and
then
she
began
with
all
manner
of
pretty
graces
and
graciousnesses
to
ask
me
questions
dear
me
it
was
like
a
bird
or
a
flute
or
something
talking
i
felt
persuaded
that
this
woman
must
have
been
misrepresented
lied
about
she
trilled
along
and
trilled
along
and
presently
a
handsome
young
page
clothed
like
the
rainbow
and
as
easy
and
undulatory
of
movement
as
a
wave
came
with
something
on
a
golden
salver
and
kneeling
to
present
it
to
her
overdid
his
graces
and
lost
his
balance
and
so
fell
lightly
against
her
knee
she
slipped
a
dirk
into
him
in
as
matterofcourse
a
way
as
another
person
would
have
harpooned
a
rat
poor
child
he
slumped
to
the
floor
twisted
his
silken
limbs
in
one
great
straining
contortion
of
pain
and
was
dead
out
of
the
old
king
was
wrung
an
involuntary
oh
of
compassion
the
look
he
got
made
him
cut
it
suddenly
short
and
not
put
any
more
hyphens
in
it
sir
uwaine
at
a
sign
from
his
mother
went
to
the
anteroom
and
called
some
servants
and
meanwhile
madame
went
rippling
sweetly
along
with
her
talk
i
saw
that
she
was
a
good
housekeeper
for
while
she
talked
she
kept
a
corner
of
her
eye
on
the
servants
to
see
that
they
made
no
balks
in
handling
the
body
and
getting
it
out
when
they
came
with
fresh
clean
towels
she
sent
back
for
the
other
kind
and
when
they
had
finished
wiping
the
floor
and
were
going
she
indicated
a
crimson
fleck
the
size
of
a
tear
which
their
duller
eyes
had
overlooked
it
was
plain
to
me
that
la
cote
male
taile
had
failed
to
see
the
mistress
of
the
house
often
how
louder
and
clearer
than
any
tongue
does
dumb
circumstantial
evidence
speak
morgan
le
fay
rippled
along
as
musically
as
ever
marvelous
woman
and
what
a
glance
she
had
when
it
fell
in
reproof
upon
those
servants
they
shrunk
and
quailed
as
timid
people
do
when
the
lightning
flashes
out
of
a
cloud
i
could
have
got
the
habit
myself
it
was
the
same
with
that
poor
old
brer
uriens
he
was
always
on
the
ragged
edge
of
apprehension
she
could
not
even
turn
toward
him
but
he
winced
in
the
midst
of
the
talk
i
let
drop
a
complimentary
word
about
king
arthur
forgetting
for
the
moment
how
this
woman
hated
her
brother
that
one
little
compliment
was
enough
she
clouded
up
like
storm
she
called
for
her
guards
and
said
hale
me
these
varlets
to
the
dungeons
that
struck
cold
on
my
ears
for
her
dungeons
had
a
reputation
nothing
occurred
to
me
to
sayor
do
but
not
so
with
sandy
as
the
guard
laid
a
hand
upon
me
she
piped
up
with
the
tranquilest
confidence
and
said
gods
wounds
dost
thou
covet
destruction
thou
maniac
it
is
the
boss
now
what
a
happy
idea
that
wasand
so
simple
yet
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
i
was
born
modest
not
all
over
but
in
spots
and
this
was
one
of
the
spots
the
effect
upon
madame
was
electrical
it
cleared
her
countenance
and
brought
back
her
smiles
and
all
her
persuasive
graces
and
blandishments
but
nevertheless
she
was
not
able
to
entirely
cover
up
with
them
the
fact
that
she
was
in
a
ghastly
fright
she
said
la
but
do
list
to
thine
handmaid
as
if
one
gifted
with
powers
like
to
mine
might
say
the
thing
which
i
have
said
unto
one
who
has
vanquished
merlin
and
not
be
jesting
by
mine
enchantments
i
foresaw
your
coming
and
by
them
i
knew
you
when
you
entered
here
i
did
but
play
this
little
jest
with
hope
to
surprise
you
into
some
display
of
your
art
as
not
doubting
you
would
blast
the
guards
with
occult
fires
consuming
them
to
ashes
on
the
spot
a
marvel
much
beyond
mine
own
ability
yet
one
which
i
have
long
been
childishly
curious
to
see
the
guards
were
less
curious
and
got
out
as
soon
as
they
got
permission
chapter
xvii
a
royal
banquet
madame
seeing
me
pacific
and
unresentful
no
doubt
judged
that
i
was
deceived
by
her
excuse
for
her
fright
dissolved
away
and
she
was
soon
so
importunate
to
have
me
give
an
exhibition
and
kill
somebody
that
the
thing
grew
to
be
embarrassing
however
to
my
relief
she
was
presently
interrupted
by
the
call
to
prayers
i
will
say
this
much
for
the
nobility
that
tyrannical
murderous
rapacious
and
morally
rotten
as
they
were
they
were
deeply
and
enthusiastically
religious
nothing
could
divert
them
from
the
regular
and
faithful
performance
of
the
pieties
enjoined
by
the
church
more
than
once
i
had
seen
a
noble
who
had
gotten
his
enemy
at
a
disadvantage
stop
to
pray
before
cutting
his
throat
more
than
once
i
had
seen
a
noble
after
ambushing
and
despatching
his
enemy
retire
to
the
nearest
wayside
shrine
and
humbly
give
thanks
without
even
waiting
to
rob
the
body
there
was
to
be
nothing
finer
or
sweeter
in
the
life
of
even
benvenuto
cellini
that
roughhewn
saint
ten
centuries
later
all
the
nobles
of
britain
with
their
families
attended
divine
service
morning
and
night
daily
in
their
private
chapels
and
even
the
worst
of
them
had
family
worship
five
or
six
times
a
day
besides
the
credit
of
this
belonged
entirely
to
the
church
although
i
was
no
friend
to
that
catholic
church
i
was
obliged
to
admit
this
and
often
in
spite
of
me
i
found
myself
saying
what
would
this
country
be
without
the
church
after
prayers
we
had
dinner
in
a
great
banqueting
hall
which
was
lighted
by
hundreds
of
greasejets
and
everything
was
as
fine
and
lavish
and
rudely
splendid
as
might
become
the
royal
degree
of
the
hosts
at
the
head
of
the
hall
on
a
dais
was
the
table
of
the
king
queen
and
their
son
prince
uwaine
stretching
down
the
hall
from
this
was
the
general
table
on
the
floor
at
this
above
the
salt
sat
the
visiting
nobles

families

persons
below

sat
minor
officers
of
the
household
with
their
principal
subordinates
altogether
a
hundred
and
eighteen
persons
sitting
and
about
as
many
liveried
servants
standing
behind
their
chairs
or
serving
in
one
capacity
or
another
it
was
a
very
fine
show
in
a
gallery
a
band
with
cymbals
horns
harps
and
other
horrors
opened
the
proceedings
with
what
seemed
to
be
the
crude
firstdraft
or
original
agony
of
the
wail
known
to
later
centuries
as
in
the
sweet
bye
and
bye
it
was
new
and
ought
to
have
been
rehearsed
a
little
more
for
some
reason
or
other
the
queen
had
the
composer
hanged
after
dinner
after
this
music
the
priest
who
stood
behind
the
royal
table
said
a
noble
long
grace
in
ostensible
latin
then
the
battalion
of
waiters
broke
away
from
their
posts
and
darted
rushed
flew
fetched
and
carried
and
the
mighty
feeding
began
no
words
anywhere
but
absorbing
attention
to
business
the
rows
of
chops
opened
and
shut
in
vast
unison
and
the
sound
of
it
was
like
to
the
muffled
burr
of
subterranean
machinery
the
havoc
continued
an
hour
and
a
half
and
unimaginable
was
the
destruction
of
substantials
of
the
chief
feature
of
the
feast
the
huge
wild
boar
that
lay
stretched
out
so
portly
and
imposing
at
the
startnothing
was
left
but
the
semblance
of
a
hoopskirt
and
he
was
but
the
type
and
symbol
of
what
had
happened
to
all
the
other
dishes
with
the
pastries
and
so
on
the
heavy
drinking
beganand
the
talk
gallon
after
gallon
of
wine
and
mead
disappeared
and
everybody
got
comfortable
then
happy
then
sparklingly
joyousboth
sexes
and
by
and
by
pretty
noisy
men
told
anecdotes
that
were
terrific
to
hear
but
nobody
blushed
and
when
the
nub
was
sprung
the
assemblage
let
go
with
a
horselaugh
that
shook
the
fortress
ladies
answered
back
with
historiettes
that
would
almost
have
made
queen
margaret
of
navarre
or
even
the
great
elizabeth
of
england
hide
behind
a
handkerchief
but
nobody
hid
here
but
only
laughed
howled
you
may
say
in
pretty
much
all
of
these
dreadful
stories
ecclesiastics
were
the
hardy
heroes
but
that
didnt
worry
the
chaplain
any
he
had
his
laugh
with
the
rest
more
than
that
upon
invitation
he
roared
out
a
song
which
was
of
as
daring
a
sort
as
any
that
was
sung
that
night
by
midnight
everybody
was
fagged
out
and
sore
with
laughing
and
as
a
rule
drunk
some
weepingly
some
affectionately
some
hilariously
some
quarrelsomely
some
dead
and
under
the
table
of
the
ladies
the
worst
spectacle
was
a
lovely
young
duchess
whose
weddingeve
this
was
and
indeed
she
was
a
spectacle
sure
enough
just
as
she
was
she
could
have
sat
in
advance
for
the
portrait
of
the
young
daughter
of
the
regent
dorleans
at
the
famous
dinner
whence
she
was
carried
foulmouthed
intoxicated
and
helpless
to
her
bed
in
the
lost
and
lamented
days
of
the
ancient
regime
suddenly
even
while
the
priest
was
lifting
his
hands
and
all
conscious
heads
were
bowed
in
reverent
expectation
of
the
coming
blessing
there
appeared
under
the
arch
of
the
faroff
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
hall
an
old
and
bent
and
whitehaired
lady
leaning
upon
a
crutchstick
and
she
lifted
the
stick
and
pointed
it
toward
the
queen
and
cried
out
the
wrath
and
curse
of
god
fall
upon
you
woman
without
pity
who
have
slain
mine
innocent
grandchild
and
made
desolate
this
old
heart
that
had
nor
chick
nor
friend
nor
stay
nor
comfort
in
all
this
world
but
him
everybody
crossed
himself
in
a
grisly
fright
for
a
curse
was
an
awful
thing
to
those
people
but
the
queen
rose
up
majestic
with
the
deathlight
in
her
eye
and
flung
back
this
ruthless
command
lay
hands
on
her
to
the
stake
with
her
the
guards
left
their
posts
to
obey
it
was
a
shame
it
was
a
cruel
thing
to
see
what
could
be
done
sandy
gave
me
a
look
i
knew
she
had
another
inspiration
i
said
do
what
you
choose
she
was
up
and
facing
toward
the
queen
in
a
moment
she
indicated
me
and
said
madame
he
saith
this
may
not
be
recall
the
commandment
or
he
will
dissolve
the
castle
and
it
shall
vanish
away
like
the
instable
fabric
of
a
dream
confound
it
what
a
crazy
contract
to
pledge
a
person
to
what
if
the
queen
but
my
consternation
subsided
there
and
my
panic
passed
off
for
the
queen
all
in
a
collapse
made
no
show
of
resistance
but
gave
a
countermanding
sign
and
sunk
into
her
seat
when
she
reached
it
she
was
sober
so
were
many
of
the
others
the
assemblage
rose
whiffed
ceremony
to
the
winds
and
rushed
for
the
door
like
a
mob
overturning
chairs
smashing
crockery
tugging
struggling
shouldering
crowdinganything
to
get
out
before
i
should
change
my
mind
and
puff
the
castle
into
the
measureless
dim
vacancies
of
space
well
well
well
they
were
a
superstitious
lot
it
is
all
a
body
can
do
to
conceive
of
it
the
poor
queen
was
so
scared
and
humbled
that
she
was
even
afraid
to
hang
the
composer
without
first
consulting
me
i
was
very
sorry
for
herindeed
any
one
would
have
been
for
she
was
really
suffering
so
i
was
willing
to
do
anything
that
was
reasonable
and
had
no
desire
to
carry
things
to
wanton
extremities
i
therefore
considered
the
matter
thoughtfully
and
ended
by
having
the
musicians
ordered
into
our
presence
to
play
that
sweet
bye
and
bye
again
which
they
did
then
i
saw
that
she
was
right
and
gave
her
permission
to
hang
the
whole
band
this
little
relaxation
of
sternness
had
a
good
effect
upon
the
queen
a
statesman
gains
little
by
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
ironclad
authority
upon
all
occasions
that
offer
for
this
wounds
the
just
pride
of
his
subordinates
and
thus
tends
to
undermine
his
strength
a
little
concession
now
and
then
where
it
can
do
no
harm
is
the
wiser
policy
now
that
the
queen
was
at
ease
in
her
mind
once
more
and
measurably
happy
her
wine
naturally
began
to
assert
itself
again
and
it
got
a
little
the
start
of
her
i
mean
it
set
her
music
goingher
silver
bell
of
a
tongue
dear
me
she
was
a
master
talker
it
would
not
become
me
to
suggest
that
it
was
pretty
late
and
that
i
was
a
tired
man
and
very
sleepy
i
wished
i
had
gone
off
to
bed
when
i
had
the
chance
now
i
must
stick
it
out
there
was
no
other
way
so
she
tinkled
along
and
along
in
the
otherwise
profound
and
ghostly
hush
of
the
sleeping
castle
until
by
and
by
there
came
as
if
from
deep
down
under
us
a
faraway
sound
as
of
a
muffled
shriek
with
an
expression
of
agony
about
it
that
made
my
flesh
crawl
the
queen
stopped
and
her
eyes
lighted
with
pleasure
she
tilted
her
graceful
head
as
a
bird
does
when
it
listens
the
sound
bored
its
way
up
through
the
stillness
again
what
is
it
i
said
it
is
truly
a
stubborn
soul
and
endureth
long
it
is
many
hours
now
endureth
what
the
rack
comeye
shall
see
a
blithe
sight
an
he
yield
not
his
secret
now
ye
shall
see
him
torn
asunder
what
a
silky
smooth
hellion
she
was
and
so
composed
and
serene
when
the
cords
all
down
my
legs
were
hurting
in
sympathy
with
that
mans
pain
conducted
by
mailed
guards
bearing
flaring
torches
we
tramped
along
echoing
corridors
and
down
stone
stairways
dank
and
dripping
and
smelling
of
mould
and
ages
of
imprisoned
night
a
chill
uncanny
journey
and
a
long
one
and
not
made
the
shorter
or
the
cheerier
by
the
sorceresss
talk
which
was
about
this
sufferer
and
his
crime
he
had
been
accused
by
an
anonymous
informer
of
having
killed
a
stag
in
the
royal
preserves
i
said
anonymous
testimony
isnt
just
the
right
thing
your
highness
it
were
fairer
to
confront
the
accused
with
the
accuser
i
had
not
thought
of
that
it
being
but
of
small
consequence
but
an
i
would
i
could
not
for
that
the
accuser
came
masked
by
night
and
told
the
forester
and
straightway
got
him
hence
again
and
so
the
forester
knoweth
him
not
then
is
this
unknown
the
only
person
who
saw
the
stag
killed
marry
no
man
saw
the
killing
but
this
unknown
saw
this
hardy
wretch
near
to
the
spot
where
the
stag
lay
and
came
with
right
loyal
zeal
and
betrayed
him
to
the
forester
so
the
unknown
was
near
the
dead
stag
too
isnt
it
just
possible
that
he
did
the
killing
himself
his
loyal
zealin
a
masklooks
just
a
shade
suspicious
but
what
is
your
highnesss
idea
for
racking
the
prisoner
where
is
the
profit
he
will
not
confess
else
and
then
were
his
soul
lost
for
his
crime
his
life
is
forfeited
by
the
lawand
of
a
surety
will
i
see
that
he
payeth
itbut
it
were
peril
to
my
own
soul
to
let
him
die
unconfessed
and
unabsolved
nay
i
were
a
fool
to
fling
me
into
hell
for
his
accommodation
but
your
highness
suppose
he
has
nothing
to
confess
as
to
that
we
shall
see
anon
an
i
rack
him
to
death
and
he
confess
not
it
will
peradventure
show
that
he
had
indeed
naught
to
confessye
will
grant
that
that
is
sooth
then
shall
i
not
be
damned
for
an
unconfessed
man
that
had
naught
to
confess
wherefore
i
shall
be
safe
it
was
the
stubborn
unreasoning
of
the
time
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
her
arguments
have
no
chance
against
petrified
training
they
wear
it
as
little
as
the
waves
wear
a
cliff
and
her
training
was
everybodys
the
brightest
intellect
in
the
land
would
not
have
been
able
to
see
that
her
position
was
defective
as
we
entered
the
rackcell
i
caught
a
picture
that
will
not
go
from
me
i
wish
it
would
a
native
young
giant
of
thirty
or
thereabouts
lay
stretched
upon
the
frame
on
his
back
with
his
wrists
and
ankles
tied
to
ropes
which
led
over
windlasses
at
either
end
there
was
no
color
in
him
his
features
were
contorted
and
set
and
sweatdrops
stood
upon
his
forehead
a
priest
bent
over
him
on
each
side
the
executioner
stood
by
guards
were
on
duty
smoking
torches
stood
in
sockets
along
the
walls
in
a
corner
crouched
a
poor
young
creature
her
face
drawn
with
anguish
a
halfwild
and
hunted
look
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
lap
lay
a
little
child
asleep
just
as
we
stepped
across
the
threshold
the
executioner
gave
his
machine
a
slight
turn
which
wrung
a
cry
from
both
the
prisoner
and
the
woman
but
i
shouted
and
the
executioner
released
the
strain
without
waiting
to
see
who
spoke
i
could
not
let
this
horror
go
on
it
would
have
killed
me
to
see
it
i
asked
the
queen
to
let
me
clear
the
place
and
speak
to
the
prisoner
privately
and
when
she
was
going
to
object
i
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
said
i
did
not
want
to
make
a
scene
before
her
servants
but
i
must
have
my
way
for
i
was
king
arthurs
representative
and
was
speaking
in
his
name
she
saw
she
had
to
yield
i
asked
her
to
indorse
me
to
these
people
and
then
leave
me
it
was
not
pleasant
for
her
but
she
took
the
pill
and
even
went
further
than
i
was
meaning
to
require
i
only
wanted
the
backing
of
her
own
authority
but
she
said
ye
will
do
in
all
things
as
this
lord
shall
command
it
is
the
boss
it
was
certainly
a
good
word
to
conjure
with
you
could
see
it
by
the
squirming
of
these
rats
the
queens
guards
fell
into
line
and
she
and
they
marched
away
with
their
torchbearers
and
woke
the
echoes
of
the
cavernous
tunnels
with
the
measured
beat
of
their
retreating
footfalls
i
had
the
prisoner
taken
from
the
rack
and
placed
upon
his
bed
and
medicaments
applied
to
his
hurts
and
wine
given
him
to
drink
the
woman
crept
near
and
looked
on
eagerly
lovingly
but
timorouslylike
one
who
fears
a
repulse
indeed
she
tried
furtively
to
touch
the
mans
forehead
and
jumped
back
the
picture
of
fright
when
i
turned
unconsciously
toward
her
it
was
pitiful
to
see
lord
i
said
stroke
him
lass
if
you
want
to
do
anything
youre
a
mind
to
dont
mind
me
why
her
eyes
were
as
grateful
as
an
animals
when
you
do
it
a
kindness
that
it
understands
the
baby
was
out
of
her
way
and
she
had
her
cheek
against
the
mans
in
a
minute
and
her
hands
fondling
his
hair
and
her
happy
tears
running
down
the
man
revived
and
caressed
his
wife
with
his
eyes
which
was
all
he
could
do
i
judged
i
might
clear
the
den
now
and
i
did
cleared
it
of
all
but
the
family
and
myself
then
i
said
now
my
friend
tell
me
your
side
of
this
matter
i
know
the
other
side
the
man
moved
his
head
in
sign
of
refusal
but
the
woman
looked
pleasedas
it
seemed
to
mepleased
with
my
suggestion
i
went
on
you
know
of
me
yes
all
do
in
arthurs
realms
if
my
reputation
has
come
to
you
right
and
straight
you
should
not
be
afraid
to
speak
the
woman
broke
in
eagerly
ah

my
lord
do
thou
persuade
him
thou
canst
an
thou
wilt
ah
he
suffereth

and
it
is
for

might
see
him
diea
sweet
swift
death
oh
my
hugo
i
cannot
bear
this
one
and
she
fell
to
sobbing
and
grovelling
about
my
feet
and
still
imploring
imploring
what
the
mans
death
i
could
not
quite
get
the
bearings
of
the
thing
but
hugo
interrupted
her
and
said
peace
ye
wit
not
what
ye
ask
shall
i
starve
whom
i
love
to
win
a
gentle
death
i
wend
thou
knewest
me
better
well
i
said
i
cant
quite
make
this
out
it
is
a
puzzle
now
ah
dear
my
lord
an
ye
will
but
persuade
him
consider
how
these
his
tortures
wound
me
oh
and
he
will
not
speakwhereas
the
healing
the
solace
that
lie
in
a
blessed
swift
death
what
are
you
maundering
about
hes
going
out
from
here
a
free
man
and
wholehes
not
going
to
die
the
mans
white
face
lit
up
and
the
woman
flung
herself
at
me
in
a
most
surprising
explosion
of
joy
and
cried
out
he
is
savedfor
it
is
the
kings
word
by
the
mouth
of
the
kings
servantarthur
the
king
whose
word
is
gold
well
then
you
do
believe
i
can
be
trusted
after
all
why
didnt
you
before
who
doubted
not
i
indeed
and
not
she
well
why
wouldnt
you
tell
me
your
story
then
ye
had
made
no
promise
else
had
it
been
otherwise
i
see
i
see
and
yet
i
believe
i
dont
quite
see
after
all
you
stood
the
torture
and
refused
to
confess
which
shows
plain
enough
to
even
the
dullest
understanding
that
you
had
nothing
to
confess
i
my
lord
how
so
it
was
i
that
killed
the
deer
you
did
oh
dear
this
is
the
most
mixedup
business
that
ever
dear
lord
i
begged
him
on
my
knees
to
confess
but
you
did
it
gets
thicker
and
thicker
what
did
you
want
him
to
do
that
for
sith
it
would
bring
him
a
quick
death
and
save
him
all
this
cruel
pain
wellyes
there
is
reason
in
that
but
he
didnt
want
the
quick
death
he
why
of
a
surety
he
did
well
then
why
in
the
world
didnt
he
confess
ah
sweet
sir
and
leave
my
wife
and
chick
without
bread
and
shelter
oh
heart
of
gold
now
i
see
it

bitter
law
takes
the
convicted
mans
estate
and
beggars
his
widow
and
his
orphans
they
could
torture
you
to
death
but
without
conviction
or
confession
they
could
not
rob
your
wife
and
baby
you
stood
by
them
like
a
man
and
youtrue

it

chapter
xviii
in
the
queens
dungeons
well
i
arranged
all
that
and
i
had
the
man
sent
to
his
home
i
had
a
great
desire
to
rack
the
executioner
not
because
he
was
a
good
painstaking
and
paingiving
officialfor
surely
it
was
not
to
his
discredit
that
he
performed
his
functions
wellbut
to
pay
him
back
for
wantonly
cuffing
and
otherwise
distressing
that
young
woman
the
priests
told
me
about
this
and
were
generously
hot
to
have
him
punished
something
of
this
disagreeable
sort
was
turning
up
every
now
and
then
i
mean
episodes
that
showed
that
not
all
priests
were
frauds
and
selfseekers
but
that
many
even
the
great
majority
of
these
that
were
down
on
the
ground
among
the
common
people
were
sincere
and
righthearted
and
devoted
to
the
alleviation
of
human
troubles
and
sufferings
well
it
was
a
thing
which
could
not
be
helped
so
i
seldom
fretted
about
it
and
never
many
minutes
at
a
time
it
has
never
been
my
way
to
bother
much
about
things
which
you
cant
cure
but
i
did
not
like
it
for
it
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
to
keep
people
reconciled
to
an
established
church
we
must
have
a
religion
it
goes
without
sayingbut
my
idea
is
to
have
it
cut
up
into
forty
free
sects
so
that
they
will
police
each
other
as
had
been
the
case
in
the
united
states
in
my
time
concentration
of
power
in
a
political
machine
is
bad
and
an
established
church
is
only
a
political
machine
it
was
invented
for
that
it
is
nursed
cradled
preserved
for
that
it
is
an
enemy
to
human
liberty
and
does
no
good
which
it
could
not
better
do
in
a
splitup
and
scattered
condition
that
wasnt
law
it
wasnt
gospel
it
was
only
an
opinionmy
opinion
and
i
was
only
a
man
one
man
so
it
wasnt
worth
any
more
than
the
popesor
any
less
for
that
matter
well
i
couldnt
rack
the
executioner
neither
would
i
overlook
the
just
complaint
of
the
priests
the
man
must
be
punished
somehow
or
other
so
i
degraded
him
from
his
office
and
made
him
leader
of
the
bandthe
new
one
that
was
to
be
started
he
begged
hard
and
said
he
couldnt
playa
plausible
excuse
but
too
thin
there
wasnt
a
musician
in
the
country
that
could
the
queen
was
a
good
deal
outraged
next
morning
when
she
found
she
was
going
to
have
neither
hugos
life
nor
his
property
but
i
told
her
she
must
bear
this
cross
that
while
by
law
and
custom
she
certainly
was
entitled
to
both
the
mans
life
and
his
property
there
were
extenuating
circumstances
and
so
in
arthur
the
kings
name
i
had
pardoned
him
the
deer
was
ravaging
the
mans
fields
and
he
had
killed
it
in
sudden
passion
and
not
for
gain
and
he
had
carried
it
into
the
royal
forest
in
the
hope
that
that
might
make
detection
of
the
misdoer
impossible
confound
her
i
couldnt
make
her
see
that
sudden
passion
is
an
extenuating
circumstance
in
the
killing
of
venisonor
of
a
personso
i
gave
it
up
and
let
her
sulk
it
out
i
did
think
i
was
going
to
make
her
see
it
by
remarking
that
her
own
sudden
passion
in
the
case
of
the
page
modified
that
crime
crime
she
exclaimed
how
thou
talkest
crime
forsooth
man
i
am
going
to
pay
for
him
oh
it
was
no
use
to
waste
sense
on
her
trainingtraining
is
everything
training
is
all
there
is
to
a
person
we
speak
of
nature
it
is
folly
there
is
no
such
thing
as
nature
what
we
call
by
that
misleading
name
is
merely
heredity
and
training
we
have
no
thoughts
of
our
own
no
opinions
of
our
own
they
are
transmitted
to
us
trained
into
us
all
that
is
original
in
us
and
therefore
fairly
creditable
or
discreditable
to
us
can
be
covered
up
and
hidden
by
the
point
of
a
cambric
needle
all
the
rest
being
atoms
contributed
by
and
inherited
from
a
procession
of
ancestors
that
stretches
back
a
billion
years
to
the
adamclam
or
grasshopper
or
monkey
from
whom
our
race
has
been
so
tediously
and
ostentatiously
and
unprofitably
developed
and
as
for
me
all
that
i
think
about
in
this
plodding
sad
pilgrimage
this
pathetic
drift
between
the
eternities
is
to
look
out
and
humbly
live
a
pure
and
high
and
blameless
life
and
save
that
one
microscopic
atom
in
me
that
is
truly
me
the
rest
may
land
in
sheol
and
welcome
for
all
i
care
no
confound
her
her
intellect
was
good
she
had
brains
enough
but
her
training
made
her
an
assthat
is
from
a
manycenturieslater
point
of
view
to
kill
the
page
was
no
crimeit
was
her
right
and
upon
her
right
she
stood
serenely
and
unconscious
of
offense
she
was
a
result
of
generations
of
training
in
the
unexamined
and
unassailed
belief
that
the
law
which
permitted
her
to
kill
a
subject
when
she
chose
was
a
perfectly
right
and
righteous
one
well
we
must
give
even
satan
his
due
she
deserved
a
compliment
for
one
thing
and
i
tried
to
pay
it
but
the
words
stuck
in
my
throat
she
had
a
right
to
kill
the
boy
but
she
was
in
no
wise
obliged
to
pay
for
him
that
was
law
for
some
other
people
but
not
for
her
she
knew
quite
well
that
she
was
doing
a
large
and
generous
thing
to
pay
for
that
lad
and
that
i
ought
in
common
fairness
to
come
out
with
something
handsome
about
it
but
i
couldntmy
mouth
refused
i
couldnt
help
seeing
in
my
fancy
that
poor
old
grandma
with
the
broken
heart
and
that
fair
young
creature
lying
butchered
his
little
silken
pomps
and
vanities
laced
with
his
golden
blood
how
could
she
pay
for
him
whom
could
she
pay
and
so
well
knowing
that
this
woman
trained
as
she
had
been
deserved
praise
even
adulation
i
was
yet
not
able
to
utter
it
trained
as
i
had
been
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
fish
up
a
compliment
from
outside
so
to
speakand
the
pity
of
it
was
that
it
was
true
madame
your
people
will
adore
you
for
this
quite
true
but
i
meant
to
hang
her
for
it
some
day
if
i
lived
some
of
those
laws
were
too
bad
altogether
too
bad
a
master
might
kill
his
slave
for
nothingfor
mere
spite
malice
or
to
pass
the
timejust
as
we
have
seen
that
the
crowned
head
could
do
it
with
his
slave
that
is
to
say
anybody
a
gentleman
could
kill
a
free
commoner
and
pay
for
himcash
or
gardentruck
a
noble
could
kill
a
noble
without
expense
as
far
as
the
law
was
concerned
but
reprisals
in
kind
were
to
be
expected
anybody
could
kill
somebody
except
the
commoner
and
the
slave
these
had
no
privileges
if
they
killed
it
was
murder
and
the
law
wouldnt
stand
murder
it
made
short
work
of
the
experimenterand
of
his
family
too
if
he
murdered
somebody
who
belonged
up
among
the
ornamental
ranks
if
a
commoner
gave
a
noble
even
so
much
as
a
damiensscratch
which
didnt
kill
or
even
hurt
he
got
damiens
dose
for
it
just
the
same
they
pulled
him
to
rags
and
tatters
with
horses
and
all
the
world
came
to
see
the
show
and
crack
jokes
and
have
a
good
time
and
some
of
the
performances
of
the
best
people
present
were
as
tough
and
as
properly
unprintable
as
any
that
have
been
printed
by
the
pleasant
casanova
in
his
chapter
about
the
dismemberment
of
louis
xvs
poor
awkward
enemy
i
had
had
enough
of
this
grisly
place
by
this
time
and
wanted
to
leave
but
i
couldnt
because
i
had
something
on
my
mind
that
my
conscience
kept
prodding
me
about
and
wouldnt
let
me
forget
if
i
had
the
remaking
of
man
he
wouldnt
have
any
conscience
it
is
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
things
connected
with
a
person
and
although
it
certainly
does
a
great
deal
of
good
it
cannot
be
said
to
pay
in
the
long
run
it
would
be
much
better
to
have
less
good
and
more
comfort
still
this
is
only
my
opinion
and
i
am
only
one
man
others
with
less
experience
may
think
differently
they
have
a
right
to
their
view
i
only
stand
to
this
i
have
noticed
my
conscience
for
many
years
and
i
know
it
is
more
trouble
and
bother
to
me
than
anything
else
i
started
with
i
suppose
that
in
the
beginning
i
prized
it
because
we
prize
anything
that
is
ours
and
yet
how
foolish
it
was
to
think
so
if
we
look
at
it
in
another
way
we
see
how
absurd
it
is
if
i
had
an
anvil
in
me
would
i
prize
it
of
course
not
and
yet
when
you
come
to
think
there
is
no
real
difference
between
a
conscience
and
an
anvili
mean
for
comfort
i
have
noticed
it
a
thousand
times
and
you
could
dissolve
an
anvil
with
acids
when
you
couldnt
stand
it
any
longer
but
there
isnt
any
way
that
you
can
work
off
a
conscienceat
least
so
it
will
stay
worked
off
not
that
i
know
of
anyway
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
do
before
leaving
but
it
was
a
disagreeable
matter
and
i
hated
to
go
at
it
well
it
bothered
me
all
the
morning
i
could
have
mentioned
it
to
the
old
king
but
what
would
be
the
usehe
was
but
an
extinct
volcano
he
had
been
active
in
his
time
but
his
fire
was
out
this
good
while
he
was
only
a
stately
ashpile
now
gentle
enough
and
kindly
enough
for
my
purpose
without
doubt
but
not
usable
he
was
nothing
this
socalled
king
the
queen
was
the
only
power
there
and
she
was
a
vesuvius
as
a
favor
she
might
consent
to
warm
a
flock
of
sparrows
for
you
but
then
she
might
take
that
very
opportunity
to
turn
herself
loose
and
bury
a
city
however
i
reflected
that
as
often
as
any
other
way
when
you
are
expecting
the
worst
you
get
something
that
is
not
so
bad
after
all
so
i
braced
up
and
placed
my
matter
before
her
royal
highness
i
said
i
had
been
having
a
general
jaildelivery
at
camelot
and
among
neighboring
castles
and
with
her
permission
i
would
like
to
examine
her
collection
her
bricabracthat
is
to
say
her
prisoners
she
resisted
but
i
was
expecting
that
but
she
finally
consented
i
was
expecting
that
too
but
not
so
soon
that
about
ended
my
discomfort
she
called
her
guards
and
torches
and
we
went
down
into
the
dungeons
these
were
down
under
the
castles
foundations
and
mainly
were
small
cells
hollowed
out
of
the
living
rock
some
of
these
cells
had
no
light
at
all
in
one
of
them
was
a
woman
in
foul
rags
who
sat
on
the
ground
and
would
not
answer
a
question
or
speak
a
word
but
only
looked
up
at
us
once
or
twice
through
a
cobweb
of
tangled
hair
as
if
to
see
what
casual
thing
it
might
be
that
was
disturbing
with
sound
and
light
the
meaningless
dull
dream
that
was
become
her
life
after
that
she
sat
bowed
with
her
dirtcaked
fingers
idly
interlocked
in
her
lap
and
gave
no
further
sign
this
poor
rack
of
bones
was
a
woman
of
middle
age
apparently
but
only
apparently
she
had
been
there
nine
years
and
was
eighteen
when
she
entered
she
was
a
commoner
and
had
been
sent
here
on
her
bridal
night
by
sir
breuse
sance
pite
a
neighboring
lord
whose
vassal
her
father
was
and
to
which
said
lord
she
had
refused
what
has
since
been
called
le
droit
du
seigneur
and
moreover
had
opposed
violence
to
violence
and
spilt
half
a
gill
of
his
almost
sacred
blood
the
young
husband
had
interfered
at
that
point
believing
the
brides
life
in
danger
and
had
flung
the
noble
out
into
the
midst
of
the
humble
and
trembling
wedding
guests
in
the
parlor
and
left
him
there
astonished
at
this
strange
treatment
and
implacably
embittered
against
both
bride
and
groom
the
said
lord
being
cramped
for
dungeonroom
had
asked
the
queen
to
accommodate
his
two
criminals
and
here
in
her
bastile
they
had
been
ever
since
hither
indeed
they
had
come
before
their
crime
was
an
hour
old
and
had
never
seen
each
other
since
here
they
were
kenneled
like
toads
in
the
same
rock
they
had
passed
nine
pitch
dark
years
within
fifty
feet
of
each
other
yet
neither
knew
whether
the
other
was
alive
or
not
all
the
first
years
their
only
question
had
beenasked
with
beseechings
and
tears
that
might
have
moved
stones
in
time
perhaps
but
hearts
are
not
stones
is
he
alive
is
she
alive
but
they
had
never
got
an
answer
and
at
last
that
question
was
not
asked
any
moreor
any
other
i
wanted
to
see
the
man
after
hearing
all
this
he
was
thirtyfour
years
old
and
looked
sixty
he
sat
upon
a
squared
block
of
stone
with
his
head
bent
down
his
forearms
resting
on
his
knees
his
long
hair
hanging
like
a
fringe
before
his
face
and
he
was
muttering
to
himself
he
raised
his
chin
and
looked
us
slowly
over
in
a
listless
dull
way
blinking
with
the
distress
of
the
torchlight
then
dropped
his
head
and
fell
to
muttering
again
and
took
no
further
notice
of
us
there
were
some
pathetically
suggestive
dumb
witnesses
present
on
his
wrists
and
ankles
were
cicatrices
old
smooth
scars
and
fastened
to
the
stone
on
which
he
sat
was
a
chain
with
manacles
and
fetters
attached
but
this
apparatus
lay
idle
on
the
ground
and
was
thick
with
rust
chains
cease
to
be
needed
after
the
spirit
has
gone
out
of
a
prisoner
i
could
not
rouse
the
man
so
i
said
we
would
take
him
to
her
and
seeto
the
bride
who
was
the
fairest
thing
in
the
earth
to
him
onceroses
pearls
and
dew
made
flesh
for
him
a
wonderwork
the
masterwork
of
nature
with
eyes
like
no
other
eyes
and
voice
like
no
other
voice
and
a
freshness
and
lithe
young
grace
and
beauty
that
belonged
properly
to
the
creatures
of
dreamsas
he
thoughtand
to
no
other
the
sight
of
her
would
set
his
stagnant
blood
leaping
the
sight
of
her
but
it
was
a
disappointment
they
sat
together
on
the
ground
and
looked
dimly
wondering
into
each
others
faces
a
while
with
a
sort
of
weak
animal
curiosity
then
forgot
each
others
presence
and
dropped
their
eyes
and
you
saw
that
they
were
away
again
and
wandering
in
some
far
land
of
dreams
and
shadows
that
we
know
nothing
about
i
had
them
taken
out
and
sent
to
their
friends
the
queen
did
not
like
it
much
not
that
she
felt
any
personal
interest
in
the
matter
but
she
thought
it
disrespectful
to
sir
breuse
sance
pite
however
i
assured
her
that
if
he
found
he
couldnt
stand
it
i
would
fix
him
so
that
he
could
i
set
fortyseven
prisoners
loose
out
of
those
awful
ratholes
and
left
only
one
in
captivity
he
was
a
lord
and
had
killed
another
lord
a
sort
of
kinsman
of
the
queen
that
other
lord
had
ambushed
him
to
assassinate
him
but
this
fellow
had
got
the
best
of
him
and
cut
his
throat
however
it
was
not
for
that
that
i
left
him
jailed
but
for
maliciously
destroying
the
only
public
well
in
one
of
his
wretched
villages
the
queen
was
bound
to
hang
him
for
killing
her
kinsman
but
i
would
not
allow
it
it
was
no
crime
to
kill
an
assassin
but
i
said
i
was
willing
to
let
her
hang
him
for
destroying
the
well
so
she
concluded
to
put
up
with
that
as
it
was
better
than
nothing
dear
me
for
what
trifling
offenses
the
most
of
those
fortyseven
men
and
women
were
shut
up
there
indeed
some
were
there
for
no
distinct
offense
at
all
but
only
to
gratify
somebodys
spite
and
not
always
the
queens
by
any
means
but
a
friends
the
newest
prisoners
crime
was
a
mere
remark
which
he
had
made
he
said
he
believed
that
men
were
about
all
alike
and
one
man
as
good
as
another
barring
clothes
he
said
he
believed
that
if
you
were
to
strip
the
nation
naked
and
send
a
stranger
through
the
crowd
he
couldnt
tell
the
king
from
a
quack
doctor
nor
a
duke
from
a
hotel
clerk
apparently
here
was
a
man
whose
brains
had
not
been
reduced
to
an
ineffectual
mush
by
idiotic
training
i
set
him
loose
and
sent
him
to
the
factory
some
of
the
cells
carved
in
the
living
rock
were
just
behind
the
face
of
the
precipice
and
in
each
of
these
an
arrowslit
had
been
pierced
outward
to
the
daylight
and
so
the
captive
had
a
thin
ray
from
the
blessed
sun
for
his
comfort
the
case
of
one
of
these
poor
fellows
was
particularly
hard
from
his
dusky
swallows
hole
high
up
in
that
vast
wall
of
native
rock
he
could
peer
out
through
the
arrowslit
and
see
his
own
home
off
yonder
in
the
valley
and
for
twentytwo
years
he
had
watched
it
with
heartache
and
longing
through
that
crack
he
could
see
the
lights
shine
there
at
night
and
in
the
daytime
he
could
see
figures
go
in
and
come
outhis
wife
and
children
some
of
them
no
doubt
though
he
could
not
make
out
at
that
distance
in
the
course
of
years
he
noted
festivities
there
and
tried
to
rejoice
and
wondered
if
they
were
weddings
or
what
they
might
be
and
he
noted
funerals
and
they
wrung
his
heart
he
could
make
out
the
coffin
but
he
could
not
determine
its
size
and
so
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
wife
or
child
he
could
see
the
procession
form
with
priests
and
mourners
and
move
solemnly
away
bearing
the
secret
with
them
he
had
left
behind
him
five
children
and
a
wife
and
in
nineteen
years
he
had
seen
five
funerals
issue
and
none
of
them
humble
enough
in
pomp
to
denote
a
servant
so
he
had
lost
five
of
his
treasures
there
must
still
be
one
remainingone
now
infinitely
unspeakably
preciousbut
which
one
wife
or
child
that
was
the
question
that
tortured
him
by
night
and
by
day
asleep
and
awake
well
to
have
an
interest
of
some
sort
and
half
a
ray
of
light
when
you
are
in
a
dungeon
is
a
great
support
to
the
body
and
preserver
of
the
intellect
this
man
was
in
pretty
good
condition
yet
by
the
time
he
had
finished
telling
me
his
distressful
tale
i
was
in
the
same
state
of
mind
that
you
would
have
been
in
yourself
if
you
have
got
average
human
curiosity
that
is
to
say
i
was
as
burning
up
as
he
was
to
find
out
which
member
of
the
family
it
was
that
was
left
so
i
took
him
over
home
myself
and
an
amazing
kind
of
a
surprise
party
it
was
too
typhoons
and
cyclones
of
frantic
joy
and
whole
niagaras
of
happy
tears
and
by
george
we
found
the
aforetime
young
matron
graying
toward
the
imminent
verge
of
her

of
the
ingenious
devilishness
of
that
queen
she
had
a
special
hatred
for
this
prisoner
and
she
had
invented
all
those
funerals
herself
to
scorch
his
heart
with
and
the
sublimest
stroke
of
genius
of
the
whole
thing
was
leaving
the
familyinvoice
a
funeral
short
so
as
to
let
him
wear
his
poor
old
soul
out
guessing
but
for
me
he
never
would
have
got
out
morgan
le
fay
hated
him
with
her
whole
heart
and
she
never
would
have
softened
toward
him
and
yet
his
crime
was
committed
more
in
thoughtlessness
than
deliberate
depravity
he
had
said
she
had
red
hair
well
she
had
but
that
was
no
way
to
speak
of
it
when
redheaded
people
are
above
a
certain
social
grade
their
hair
is
auburn
consider
it
among
these
fortyseven
captives
there
were
five
whose
names
offenses
and
dates
of
incarceration
were
no
longer
known
one
woman
and
four
menall
bent
and
wrinkled
and
mindextinguished
patriarchs
they
themselves
had
long
ago
forgotten
these
details
at
any
rate
they
had
mere
vague
theories
about
them
nothing
definite
and
nothing
that
they
repeated
twice
in
the
same
way
the
succession
of
priests
whose
office
it
had
been
to
pray
daily
with
the
captives
and
remind
them
that
god
had
put
them
there
for
some
wise
purpose
or
other
and
teach
them
that
patience
humbleness
and
submission
to
oppression
was
what
he
loved
to
see
in
parties
of
a
subordinate
rank
had
traditions
about
these
poor
old
human
ruins
but
nothing
more
these
traditions
went
but
little
way
for
they
concerned
the
length
of
the
incarceration
only
and
not
the
names
of
the
offenses
and
even
by
the
help
of
tradition
the
only
thing
that
could
be
proven
was
that
none
of
the
five
had
seen
daylight
for
thirtyfive
years
how
much
longer
this
privation
has
lasted
was
not
guessable
the
king
and
the
queen
knew
nothing
about
these
poor
creatures
except
that
they
were
heirlooms
assets
inherited
along
with
the
throne
from
the
former
firm
nothing
of
their
history
had
been
transmitted
with
their
persons
and
so
the
inheriting
owners
had
considered
them
of
no
value
and
had
felt
no
interest
in
them
i
said
to
the
queen
then
why
in
the
world
didnt
you
set
them
free
the
question
was
a
puzzler
she
didnt
know
why
she
hadnt
the
thing
had
never
come
up
in
her
mind
so
here
she
was
forecasting
the
veritable
history
of
future
prisoners
of
the
castle
dif
without
knowing
it
it
seemed
plain
to
me
now
that
with
her
training
those
inherited
prisoners
were
merely
propertynothing
more
nothing
less
well
when
we
inherit
property
it
does
not
occur
to
us
to
throw
it
away
even
when
we
do
not
value
it
when
i
brought
my
procession
of
human
bats
up
into
the
open
world
and
the
glare
of
the
afternoon

blindfolding
them
in
charity
for
eyes

i
muttered
absently
i
wish
i
could
photograph
them
you
have
seen
that
kind
of
people
who
will
never
let
on
that
they
dont
know
the
meaning
of
a
new

word
the
more
ignorant
they
are
the
more
pitifully
certain
they
are
to
pretend
you
havent
shot
over
their
heads
the
queen
was
just
one
of
that
sort
and
was
always
making
the
stupidest
blunders
by
reason
of
it
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
her
face
brightened
up
with
sudden
comprehension
and
she
said
she
would
do
it
for
me
i
thought
to
myself
she
why
what
can
she
know
about
photography
but
it
was
a
poor
time
to
be
thinking
when
i
looked
around
she
was
moving
on
the
procession
with
an
axe
well
she
certainly
was
a
curious
one
was
morgan
le
fay
i
have
seen
a
good
many
kinds
of
women
in
my
time
but
she
laid
over
them
all
for
variety
and
how
sharply
characteristic
of
her
this
episode
was
she
had
no
more
idea
than
a
horse
of
how
to
photograph
a
procession
but
being
in
doubt
it
was
just
like
her
to
try
to
do
it
with
an
axe

as
a
trade
sandy
and
i
were
on
the
road
again
next
morning
bright
and
early
it
was
so
good
to
open
up
ones
lungs
and
take
in
whole
luscious
barrelsful
of
the
blessed

untainted

woodlandscented
air
once
more
after
suffocating
body
and
mind
for
two
days
and
nights
in
the
moral
and
physical
stenches
of
that
intolerable
old
buzzardroost
i
mean
for
me
of
course
the
place
was
all
right
and
agreeable
enough
for
sandy
for
she
had
been
used
to
high
life
all
her
days
poor
girl
her
jaws
had
had
a
wearisome
rest
now
for
a
while
and
i
was
expecting
to
get
the
consequences
i
was
right
but
she
had
stood
by
me
most
helpfully
in
the
castle
and
had
mightily
supported
and
reinforced
me
with
gigantic
foolishnesses
which
were
worth
more
for
the
occasion
than
wisdoms
double
their
size
so
i
thought
she
had
earned
a
right
to
work
her
mill
for
a
while
if
she
wanted
to
and
i
felt
not
a
pang
when
she
started
it
up
now

sir

you

my

go

i
wont
interrupt
this

if
i
can
help
it

over
again
start

and
shake
out
all
your

i
will
load
my

give

now
turn
we
unto
sir
marhaus
that
rode
with
the
damsel
of
thirty
winter
of
age
southward
and
so
they
came
into
a
deep
forest
and
by
fortune
they
were
nighted
and
rode
along
in
a
deep
way
and
at
the
last
they
came
into
a
courtelage
where
abode
the
duke
of
south
marches
and
there
they
asked
harbour
and
on
the
morn
the
duke
sent
unto
sir
marhaus
and
bad
him
make
him
ready
and
so
sir
marhaus
arose
and
armed
him
and
there
was
a
mass
sung
afore
him
and
he
brake
his
fast
and
so
mounted
on
horseback
in
the
court
of
the
castle
there
they
should
do
the
battle
so
there
was
the
duke
already
on
horseback
clean
armed
and
his
six
sons
by
him
and
every
each
had
a
spear
in
his
hand
and
so
they
encountered
whereas
the
duke
and
his
two
sons
brake
their
spears
upon
him
but
sir
marhaus
held
up
his
spear
and
touched
none
of
them
then
came
the
four
sons
by
couples
and
two
of
them
brake
their
spears
and
so
did
the
other
two
and
all
this
while
sir
marhaus
touched
them
not
then
sir
marhaus
ran
to
the
duke
and
smote
him
with
his
spear
that
horse
and
man
fell
to
the
earth
and
so
he
served
his
sons
and
then
sir
marhaus
alight
down
and
bad
the
duke
yield
him
or
else
he
would
slay
him
and
then
some
of
his
sons
recovered
and
would
have
set
upon
sir
marhaus
then
sir
marhaus
said
to
the
duke
cease
thy
sons
or
else
i
will
do
the
uttermost
to
you
all
when
the
duke
saw
he
might
not
escape
the
death
he
cried
to
his
sons
and
charged
them
to
yield
them
to
sir
marhaus
and
they
kneeled
all
down
and
put
the
pommels
of
their
swords
to
the
knight
and
so
he
received
them
and
then
they
holp
up
their
father
and
so
by
their
common
assent
promised
unto
sir
marhaus
never
to
be
foes
unto
king
arthur
and
thereupon
at
whitsuntide
after
to
come
he
and
his
sons
and
put
them
in
the

slashing
away
with

i

still
he
had
six
left
for
sir

me
to
take
into

and
then
there
was

chapter
xx
the
ogres
castle
between
six
and
nine
we
made
ten
miles
which
was
plenty
for
a
horse
carrying
tripleman
woman
and
armor
then
we
stopped
for
a
long
nooning
under
some
trees
by
a
limpid
brook
right
so
came
by
and
by
a
knight
riding
and
as
he
drew
near
he
made
dolorous
moan
and
by
the
words
of
it
i
perceived
that
he
was
cursing
and
swearing
yet
nevertheless
was
i
glad
of
his
coming
for
that
i
saw
he
bore
a
bulletinboard
whereon
in
letters

the
go
i
was
glad
of
his
coming
for
even
by
this
token
i
knew
him
for
knight
of
mine
it
was
sir
madok
de
la
montaine
a
burly
great
fellow
whose
chief
distinction
was
that
he
had
come
within
an
ace
of
sending
sir
launcelot
down
over
his
horsetail
once
he
was
never
long
in
a
strangers
presence
without
finding
some
pretext
or
other
to
let
out
that
great
fact
but
there
was
another
fact
of
nearly
the
same
size
which
he
never
pushed
upon
anybody
unasked
and
yet
never
withheld
when
asked
that
was
that
the
reason
he
didnt
quite
succeed
was
that
he
was
interrupted
and
sent
down
over
horsetail
himself
this
innocent
vast
lubber
did
not
see
any
particular
difference
between
the
two
facts
i
liked
him
for
he
was
earnest
in
his
work
and
very
valuable
and
he
was
so
fine
to
look
at
with
his
broad
mailed
shoulders
and
the
grand
leonine
set
of
his
plumed
head
and
his
big
shield
with
its
quaint
device
of
a
gauntleted
hand
clutching
a
prophylactic
toothbrush
with
motto
try
noyoudont
this
was
a
toothwash
that
i
was
introducing
he
was
aweary
he
said
and
indeed
he
looked
it
but
he
would
not
alight
he
said
he
was
after
the
stovepolish
man
and
with
this
he
broke
out
cursing
and
swearing
anew
the
bulletinboarder
referred
to
was
sir
ossaise
of
surluse
a
brave
knight
and
of
considerable
celebrity
on
account
of
his
having
tried
conclusions
in
a
tournament
once
with
no
less
a
mogul
than
sir
gaheris
himselfalthough
not
successfully
he
was
of
a
light
and
laughing
disposition
and
to
him
nothing
in
this
world
was
serious
it
was
for
this
reason
that
i
had
chosen
him
to
work
up
a
stovepolish
sentiment
there
were
no
stoves
yet
and
so
there
could
be
nothing
serious
about
stovepolish
all
that
the
agent
needed
to
do
was
to
deftly
and
by
degrees
prepare
the
public
for
the
great
change
and
have
them
established
in
predilections
toward
neatness
against
the
time
when
the
stove
should
appear
upon
the
stage
sir
madok
was
very
bitter
and
brake
out
anew
with
cursings
he
said
he
had
cursed
his
soul
to
rags
and
yet
he
would
not
get
down
from
his
horse
neither
would
he
take
any
rest
or
listen
to
any
comfort
until
he
should
have
found
sir
ossaise
and
settled
this
account
it
appeared
by
what
i
could
piece
together
of
the
unprofane
fragments
of
his
statement
that
he
had
chanced
upon
sir
ossaise
at
dawn
of
the
morning
and
been
told
that
if
he
would
make
a
short
cut
across
the
fields
and
swamps
and
broken
hills
and
glades
he
could
head
off
a
company
of
travelers
who
would
be
rare
customers
for
prophylactics
and
toothwash
with
characteristic
zeal
sir
madok
had
plunged
away
at
once
upon
this
quest
and
after
three
hours
of
awful
crosslot
riding
had
overhauled
his
game
and
behold
it
was
the
five
patriarchs
that
had
been
released
from
the
dungeons
the
evening
before
poor
old
creatures
it
was
all
of
twenty
years
since
any
one
of
them
had
known
what
it
was
to
be
equipped
with
any
remaining
snag
or
remnant
of
a
tooth
blankblankblank
him
said
sir
madok
an
i
do
not
stovepolish
him
an
i
may
find
him
leave
it
to
me
for
never
no
knight
that
hight
ossaise
or
aught
else
may
do
me
this
disservice
and
bide
on
live
an
i
may
find
him
the
which
i
have
thereunto
sworn
a
great
oath
this
day
and
with
these
words
and
others
he
lightly
took
his
spear
and
gat
him
thence
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
we
came
upon
one
of
those
very
patriarchs
ourselves
in
the
edge
of
a
poor
village
he
was
basking
in
the
love
of
relatives
and
friends
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
fifty
years
and
about
him
and
caressing
him
were
also
descendants
of
his
own
body
whom
he
had
never
seen
at
all
till
now
but
to
him
these
were
all
strangers
his
memory
was
gone
his
mind
was
stagnant
it
seemed
incredible
that
a
man
could
outlast
half
a
century
shut
up
in
a
dark
hole
like
a
rat
but
here
were
his
old
wife
and
some
old
comrades
to
testify
to
it
they
could
remember
him
as
he
was
in
the
freshness
and
strength
of
his
young
manhood
when
he
kissed
his
child
and
delivered
it
to
its
mothers
hands
and
went
away
into
that
long
oblivion
the
people
at
the
castle
could
not
tell
within
half
a
generation
the
length
of
time
the
man
had
been
shut
up
there
for
his
unrecorded
and
forgotten
offense
but
this
old
wife
knew
and
so
did
her
old
child
who
stood
there
among
her
married
sons
and
daughters
trying
to
realize
a
father
who
had
been
to
her
a
name
a
thought
a
formless
image
a
tradition
all
her
life
and
now
was
suddenly
concreted
into
actual
flesh
and
blood
and
set
before
her
face
it
was
a
curious
situation
yet
it
is
not
on
that
account
that
i
have
made
room
for
it
here
but
on
account
of
a
thing
which
seemed
to
me
still
more
curious
to
wit
that
this
dreadful
matter
brought
from
these
downtrodden
people
no
outburst
of
rage
against
these
oppressors
they
had
been
heritors
and
subjects
of
cruelty
and
outrage
so
long
that
nothing
could
have
startled
them
but
a
kindness
yes
here
was
a
curious
revelation
indeed
of
the
depth
to
which
this
people
had
been
sunk
in
slavery
their
entire
being
was
reduced
to
a
monotonous
dead
level
of
patience
resignation
dumb
uncomplaining
acceptance
of
whatever
might
befall
them
in
this
life
their
very
imagination
was
dead
when
you
can
say
that
of
a
man
he
has
struck
bottom
i
reckon
there
is
no
lower
deep
for
him
i
rather
wished
i
had
gone
some
other
road
this
was
not
the
sort
of
experience
for
a
statesman
to
encounter
who
was
planning
out
a
peaceful
revolution
in
his
mind
for
it
could
not
help
bringing
up
the
ungetaroundable
fact
that
all
gentle
cant
and
philosophizing
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
no
people
in
the
world
ever
did
achieve
their
freedom
by
goodygoody
talk
and
moral
suasion
it
being
immutable
law
that
all
revolutions
that
will
succeed
must
begin
in
blood
whatever
may
answer
afterward
if
history
teaches
anything
it
teaches
that
what
this
folk
needed
then
was
a
reign
of
terror
and
a
guillotine
and
i
was
the
wrong
man
for
them
two
days
later
toward
noon
sandy
began
to
show
signs
of
excitement
and
feverish
expectancy
she
said
we
were
approaching
the
ogres
castle
i
was
surprised
into
an
uncomfortable
shock
the
object
of
our
quest
had
gradually
dropped
out
of
my
mind
this
sudden
resurrection
of
it
made
it
seem
quite
a
real
and
startling
thing
for
a
moment
and
roused
up
in
me
a
smart
interest
sandys
excitement
increased
every
moment
and
so
did
mine
for
that
sort
of
thing
is
catching
my
heart
got
to
thumping
you
cant
reason
with
your
heart
it
has
its
own
laws
and
thumps
about
things
which
the
intellect
scorns
presently
when
sandy
slid
from
the
horse
motioned
me
to
stop
and
went
creeping
stealthily
with
her
head
bent
nearly
to
her
knees
toward
a
row
of
bushes
that
bordered
a
declivity
the
thumpings
grew
stronger
and
quicker
and
they
kept
it
up
while
she
was
gaining
her
ambush
and
getting
her
glimpse
over
the
declivity
and
also
while
i
was
creeping
to
her
side
on
my
knees
her
eyes
were
burning
now
as
she
pointed
with
her
finger
and
said
in
a
panting
whisper
the
castle
the
castle
lo
where
it
looms
what
a
welcome
disappointment
i
experienced
i
said
castle
it
is
nothing
but
a
pigsty
a
pigsty
with
a
wattled
fence
around
it
she
looked
surprised
and
distressed
the
animation
faded
out
of
her
face
and
during
many
moments
she
was
lost
in
thought
and
silent
then
it
was
not
enchanted
aforetime
she
said
in
a
musing
fashion
as
if
to
herself
and
how
strange
is
this
marvel
and
how
awful
that
to
the
one
perception
it
is
enchanted
and
dight
in
a
base
and
shameful
aspect
yet
to
the
perception
of
the
other
it
is
not
enchanted
hath
suffered
no
change
but
stands
firm
and
stately
still
girt
with
its
moat
and
waving
its
banners
in
the
blue
air
from
its
towers
and
god
shield
us
how
it
pricks
the
heart
to
see
again
these
gracious
captives
and
the
sorrow
deepened
in
their
sweet
faces
we
have
tarried
along
and
are
to
blame
i
saw
my
cue
the
castle
was
enchanted
to
me
not
to
her
it
would
be
wasted
time
to
try
to
argue
her
out
of
her
delusion
it
couldnt
be
done
i
must
just
humor
it
so
i
said
this
is
a
common
casethe
enchanting
of
a
thing
to
one
eye
and
leaving
it
in
its
proper
form
to
another
you
have
heard
of
it
before
sandy
though
you
havent
happened
to
experience
it
but
no
harm
is
done
in
fact
it
is
lucky
the
way
it
is
if
these
ladies
were
hogs
to
everybody
and
to
themselves
it
would
be
necessary
to
break
the
enchantment
and
that
might
be
impossible
if
one
failed
to
find
out
the
particular
process
of
the
enchantment
and
hazardous
too
for
in
attempting
a
disenchantment
without
the
true
key
you
are
liable
to
err
and
turn
your
hogs
into
dogs
and
the
dogs
into
cats
the
cats
into
rats
and
so
on
and
end
by
reducing
your
materials
to
nothing
finally
or
to
an
odorless
gas
which
you
cant
followwhich
of
course
amounts
to
the
same
thing
but
here
by
good
luck
no
ones
eyes
but
mine
are
under
the
enchantment
and
so
it
is
of
no
consequence
to
dissolve
it
these
ladies
remain
ladies
to
you
and
to
themselves
and
to
everybody
else
and
at
the
same
time
they
will
suffer
in
no
way
from
my
delusion
for
when
i
know
that
an
ostensible
hog
is
a
lady
that
is
enough
for
me
i
know
how
to
treat
her
thanks
oh
sweet
my
lord
thou
talkest
like
an
angel
and
i
know
that
thou
wilt
deliver
them
for
that
thou
art
minded
to
great
deeds
and
art
as
strong
a
knight
of
your
hands
and
as
brave
to
will
and
to
do
as
any
that
is
on
live
i
will
not
leave
a
princess
in
the
sty
sandy
are
those
three
yonder
that
to
my
disordered
eyes
are
starveling
swineherds
the
ogres
are
they
changed
also
it
is
most
wonderful
now
am
i
fearful
for
how
canst
thou
strike
with
sure
aim
when
five
of
their
nine
cubits
of
stature
are
to
thee
invisible
ah
go
warily
fair
sir
this
is
a
mightier
emprise
than
i
wend
you
be
easy
sandy
all
i
need
to
know
is
how
much
of
an
ogre
is
invisible
then
i
know
how
to
locate
his
vitals
dont
you
be
afraid
i
will
make
short
work
of
these
buncosteerers
stay
where
you
are
i
left
sandy
kneeling
there
corpsefaced
but
plucky
and
hopeful
and
rode
down
to
the
pigsty
and
struck
up
a
trade
with
the
swineherds
i
won
their
gratitude
by
buying
out
all
the
hogs
at
the
lump
sum
of
sixteen
pennies
which
was
rather
above
latest
quotations
i
was
just
in
time
for
the
church
the
lord
of
the
manor
and
the
rest
of
the
taxgatherers
would
have
been
along
next
day
and
swept
off
pretty
much
all
the
stock
leaving
the
swineherds
very
short
of
hogs
and
sandy
out
of
princesses
but
now
the
tax
people
could
be
paid
in
cash
and
there
would
be
a
stake
left
besides
one
of
the
men
had
ten
children
and
he
said
that
last
year
when
a
priest
came
and
of
his
ten
pigs
took
the
fattest
one
for
tithes
the
wife

out
upon
him
and
offered
him
a
child
and
said
thou
beast
without
bowels
of
mercy
why
leave
me
my
child
yet
rob
me
of
the
wherewithal
to
feed
it
how
curious
the
same
thing
had
happened
in
the
wales
of
my
day
under
this
same
old
established
church
which
was
supposed
by
many
to
have
changed
its
nature
when
it
changed
its
disguise
i
sent
the
three
men
away
and
then
opened
the
sty
gate
and
beckoned
sandy
to
comewhich
she
did
and
not
leisurely
but
with
the
rush
of
a
prairie
fire
and
when
i
saw
her
fling
herself
upon
those
hogs
with
tears
of
joy
running
down
her
cheeks
and
strain
them
to
her
heart
and
kiss
them
and
caress
them
and
call
them
reverently
by
grand
princely
names
i
was
ashamed
of
her
ashamed
of
the
human
race
we
had
to
drive
those
hogs
hometen
miles
and
no
ladies
were
ever
more
fickleminded
or
contrary
they
would
stay
in
no
road
no
path
they
broke
out
through
the
brush
on
all
sides
and
flowed
away
in
all
directions
over
rocks
and
hills
and
the
roughest
places
they
could
find
and
they
must
not
be
struck
or
roughly
accosted
sandy
could
not
bear
to
see
them
treated
in
ways
unbecoming
their
rank
the
troublesomest
old
sow
of
the
lot
had
to
be
called
my
lady
and
your
highness
like
the
rest
it
is
annoying
and
difficult
to
scour
around
after
hogs
in
armor
there
was
one
small
countess
with
an
iron
ring
in
her
snout
and
hardly
any
hair
on
her
back
that
was
the
devil
for
perversity
she
gave
me
a
race
of
an
hour
over
all
sorts
of
country
and
then
we
were
right
where
we
had
started
from
having
made
not
a
rod
of
real
progress
i
seized
her
at
last
by
the
tail
and
brought
her
along
squealing
when
i
overtook
sandy
she
was
horrified
and
said
it
was
in
the
last
degree
indelicate
to
drag
a
countess
by
her
train
we
got
the
hogs
home
just
at
darkmost
of
them
the
princess
nerovens
de
morganore
was
missing
and
two
of
her
ladies
in
waiting
namely
miss
angela
bohun
and
the
demoiselle
elaine
courtemains
the
former
of
these
two
being
a
young
black
sow
with
a
white
star
in
her
forehead
and
the
latter
a
brown
one
with
thin
legs
and
a
slight
limp
in
the
forward
shank
on
the
starboard
sidea
couple
of
the
tryingest
blisters
to
drive
that
i
ever
saw
also
among
the
missing
were
several
mere
baronessesand
i
wanted
them
to
stay
missing
but
no
all
that
sausagemeat
had
to
be
found
so
servants
were
sent
out
with
torches
to
scour
the
woods
and
hills
to
that
end
of
course
the
whole
drove
was
housed
in
the
house
and
great
gunswell
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
nor
ever
heard
anything
like
it
and
never
smelt
anything
like
it
it
was
like
an
insurrection
in
a
gasometer
chapter
xxi
the
pilgrims
when
i
did
get
to
bed
at
last
i
was
unspeakably
tired
the
stretching
out
and
the
relaxing
of
the
longtense
muscles
how
luxurious
how
delicious
but
that
was
as
far
as
i
could
getsleep
was
out
of
the
question
for
the
present
the
ripping
and
tearing
and
squealing
of
the
nobility
up
and
down
the
halls
and
corridors
was
pandemonium
come
again
and
kept
me
broad
awake
being
awake
my
thoughts
were
busy
of
course
and
mainly
they
busied
themselves
with
sandys
curious
delusion
here
she
was
as
sane
a
person
as
the
kingdom
could
produce
and
yet
from
my
point
of
view
she
was
acting
like
a
crazy
woman
my
land
the
power
of
training
of
influence
of
education
it
can
bring
a
body
up
to
believe
anything
i
had
to
put
myself
in
sandys
place
to
realize
that
she
was
not
a
lunatic
yes
and
put
her
in
mine
to
demonstrate
how
easy
it
is
to
seem
a
lunatic
to
a
person
who
has
not
been
taught
as
you
have
been
taught
if
i
had
told
sandy
i
had
seen
a
wagon
uninfluenced
by
enchantment
spin
along
fifty
miles
an
hour
had
seen
a
man
unequipped
with
magic
powers
get
into
a
basket
and
soar
out
of
sight
among
the
clouds
and
had
listened
without
any
necromancers
help
to
the
conversation
of
a
person
who
was
several
hundred
miles
away
sandy
would
not
merely
have
supposed
me
to
be
crazy
she
would
have
thought
she
knew
it
everybody
around
her
believed
in
enchantments
nobody
had
any
doubts
to
doubt
that
a
castle
could
be
turned
into
a
sty
and
its
occupants
into
hogs
would
have
been
the
same
as
my
doubting
among
connecticut
people
the
actuality
of
the
telephone
and
its
wondersand
in
both
cases
would
be
absolute
proof
of
a
diseased
mind
an
unsettled
reason
yes
sandy
was
sane
that
must
be
admitted
if
i
also
would
be
saneto
sandy
i
must
keep
my
superstitions
about
unenchanted
and
unmiraculous
locomotives
balloons
and
telephones
to
myself
also
i
believed
that
the
world
was
not
flat
and
hadnt
pillars
under
it
to
support
it
nor
a
canopy
over
it
to
turn
off
a
universe
of
water
that
occupied
all
space
above
but
as
i
was
the
only
person
in
the
kingdom
afflicted
with
such
impious
and
criminal
opinions
i
recognized
that
it
would
be
good
wisdom
to
keep
quiet
about
this
matter
too
if
i
did
not
wish
to
be
suddenly
shunned
and
forsaken
by
everybody
as
a
madman
the
next
morning
sandy
assembled
the
swine
in
the
diningroom
and
gave
them
their
breakfast
waiting
upon
them
personally
and
manifesting
in
every
way
the
deep
reverence
which
the
natives
of
her
island
ancient
and
modern
have
always
felt
for
rank
let
its
outward
casket
and
the
mental
and
moral
contents
be
what
they
may
i
could
have
eaten
with
the
hogs
if
i
had
had
birth
approaching
my
lofty
official
rank
but
i
hadnt
and
so
accepted
the
unavoidable
slight
and
made
no
complaint
sandy
and
i
had
our
breakfast
at
the
second
table
the
family
were
not
at
home
i
said
how
many
are
in
the
family
sandy
and
where
do
they
keep
themselves
family
yes
which
family
good
my
lord
why
this
family
your
own
family
sooth
to
say
i
understand
you
not
i
have
no
family
no
family
why
sandy
isnt
this
your
home
now
how
indeed
might
that
be
i
have
no
home
well
then
whose
house
is
this
ah
wit
you
well
i
would
tell
you
an
i
knew
myself
comeyou
dont
even
know
these
people
then
who
invited
us
here
none
invited
us
we
but
came
that
is
all
why
woman
this
is
a
most
extraordinary
performance
the
effrontery
of
it
is
beyond
admiration
we
blandly
march
into
a
mans
house
and
cram
it
full
of
the
only
really
valuable
nobility
the
sun
has
yet
discovered
in
the
earth
and
then
it
turns
out
that
we
dont
even
know
the
mans
name
how
did
you
ever
venture
to
take
this
extravagant
liberty
i
supposed
of
course
it
was
your
home
what
will
the
man
say
what
will
he
say
forsooth
what
can
he
say
but
give
thanks
thanks
for
what
her
face
was
filled
with
a
puzzled
surprise
verily
thou
troublest
mine
understanding
with
strange
words
do
ye
dream
that
one
of
his
estate
is
like
to
have
the
honor
twice
in
his
life
to
entertain
company
such
as
we
have
brought
to
grace
his
house
withal
well
nowhen
you
come
to
that
no
its
an
even
bet
that
this
is
the
first
time
he
has
had
a
treat
like
this
then
let
him
be
thankful
and
manifest
the
same
by
grateful
speech
and
due
humility
he
were
a
dog
else
and
the
heir
and
ancestor
of
dogs
to
my
mind
the
situation
was
uncomfortable
it
might
become
more
so
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
muster
the
hogs
and
move
on
so
i
said
the
day
is
wasting
sandy
it
is
time
to
get
the
nobility
together
and
be
moving
wherefore
fair
sir
and
boss
we
want
to
take
them
to
their
home
dont
we
la
but
list
to
him
they
be
of
all
the
regions
of
the
earth
each
must
hie
to
her
own
home
wend
you
we
might
do
all
these
journeys
in
one
so
brief
life
as
he
hath
appointed
that
created
life
and
thereto
death
likewise
with
help
of
adam

the

the

that
serpent
hight
satan
aforetime
consecrated
and
set
apart
unto
that
evil
work
by
overmastering
spite
and
envy
begotten
in
his
heart
through
fell
ambitions

estate
and
great
scott
my
lord
well
you
know
we
havent
got
time
for
this
sort
of
thing
dont
you
see
we
could
distribute
these
people
around
the
earth
in
less
time
than
it
is
going
to
take
you
to
explain
that
we
cant
we
mustnt
talk
now
we
must
act
you
want
to
be
careful
you
mustnt
let
your
mill
get
the
start
of
you
that
way
at
a
time
like
this
to
business
nowand
sharps
the
word
who
is
to
take
the
aristocracy
home
even
their
friends
these
will
come
for
them
from
the
far
parts
of
the
earth
this
was
lightning
from
a
clear
sky
for
unexpectedness
and
the
relief
of
it
was
like
pardon
to
a
prisoner
she
would
remain
to
deliver
the
goods
of
course
well
then
sandy
as
our
enterprise
is
handsomely
and
successfully
ended
i
will
go
home
and
report
and
if
ever
another
one
i
also
am
ready
i
will
go
with
thee
this
was
recalling
the
pardon
how
you
will
go
with
me
why
should
you
will
i
be
traitor
to
my
knight
dost
think
that
were
dishonor
i
may
not
part
from
thee
until
in
knightly
encounter
in
the
field
some
overmatching
champion
shall
fairly
win
and
fairly
wear
me
i
were
to
blame
an
i
thought
that
that
might
ever
hap
elected
for
the
long
term
i
sighed
to
myself
i
may
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
so
then
i
spoke
up
and
said
all
right
let
us
make
a
start
while
she
was
gone
to
cry
her
farewells
over
the
pork
i
gave
that
whole
peerage
away
to
the
servants
and
i
asked
them
to
take
a
duster
and
dust
around
a
little
where
the
nobilities
had
mainly
lodged
and
promenaded
but
they
considered
that
that
would
be
hardly
worth
while
and
would
moreover
be
a
rather
grave
departure
from
custom
and
therefore
likely
to
make
talk
a
departure
from
customthat
settled
it
it
was
a
nation
capable
of
committing
any
crime
but
that
the
servants
said
they
would
follow
the
fashion
a
fashion
grown
sacred
through
immemorial
observance
they
would
scatter
fresh
rushes
in
all
the
rooms
and
halls
and
then
the
evidence
of
the
aristocratic
visitation
would
be
no
longer
visible
it
was
a
kind
of
satire
on
nature
it
was
the
scientific
method
the
geologic
method
it
deposited
the
history
of
the
family
in
a
stratified
record
and
the
antiquary
could
dig
through
it
and
tell
by
the
remains
of
each
period
what
changes
of
diet
the
family
had
introduced
successively
for
a
hundred
years
the
first
thing
we
struck
that
day
was
a
procession
of
pilgrims
it
was
not
going
our
way
but
we
joined
it
nevertheless
for
it
was
hourly
being
borne
in
upon
me
now
that
if
i
would
govern
this
country
wisely
i
must
be
posted
in
the
details
of
its
life
and
not
at
second
hand
but
by
personal
observation
and
scrutiny
this
company
of
pilgrims
resembled
chaucers
in
this
that
it
had
in
it
a
sample
of
about
all
the
upper
occupations
and
professions
the
country
could
show
and
a
corresponding
variety
of
costume
there
were
young
men
and
old
men
young
women
and
old
women
lively
folk
and
grave
folk
they
rode
upon
mules
and
horses
and
there
was
not
a
sidesaddle
in
the
party
for
this
specialty
was
to
remain
unknown
in
england
for
nine
hundred
years
yet
it
was
a
pleasant
friendly
sociable
herd
pious
happy
merry
and
full
of
unconscious
coarsenesses
and
innocent
indecencies
what
they
regarded
as
the
merry
tale
went
the
continual
round
and
caused
no
more
embarrassment
than
it
would
have
caused
in
the
best
english
society
twelve
centuries
later
practical
jokes
worthy
of
the
english
wits
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
faroff
nineteenth
century
were
sprung
here
and
there
and
yonder
along
the
line
and
compelled
the
delightedest
applause
and
sometimes
when
a
bright
remark
was
made
at
one
end
of
the
procession
and
started
on
its
travels
toward
the
other
you
could
note
its
progress
all
the
way
by
the
sparkling
spray
of
laughter
it
threw
off
from
its
bows
as
it
plowed
along
and
also
by
the
blushes
of
the
mules
in
its
wake
sandy
knew
the
goal
and
purpose
of
this
pilgrimage
and
she
posted
me
she
said
they
journey
to
the
valley
of
holiness
for
to
be
blessed
of
the
godly
hermits
and
drink
of
the
miraculous
waters
and
be
cleansed
from
sin
where
is
this
watering
place
it
lieth
a
twoday
journey
hence
by
the
borders
of
the
land
that
hight
the
cuckoo
kingdom
tell
me
about
it
is
it
a
celebrated
place
oh
of
a
truth
yes
there
be
none
more
so
of
old
time
there
lived
there
an
abbot
and
his
monks
belike
were
none
in
the
world
more
holy
than
these
for
they
gave
themselves
to
study
of
pious
books
and
spoke
not
the
one
to
the
other
or
indeed
to
any
and
ate
decayed
herbs
and
naught
thereto
and
slept
hard
and
prayed
much
and
washed
never
also
they
wore
the
same
garment
until
it
fell
from
their
bodies
through
age
and
decay
right
so
came
they
to
be
known
of
all
the
world
by
reason
of
these
holy
austerities
and
visited
by
rich
and
poor
and
reverenced
proceed
but
always
there
was
lack
of
water
there
whereas
upon
a
time
the
holy
abbot
prayed
and
for
answer
a
great
stream
of
clear
water
burst
forth
by
miracle
in
a
desert
place
now
were
the
fickle
monks
tempted
of
the
fiend
and
they
wrought
with
their
abbot
unceasingly
by
beggings
and
beseechings
that
he
would
construct
a
bath
and
when
he
was
become
aweary
and
might
not
resist
more
he
said
have
ye
your
will
then
and
granted
that
they
asked
now
mark
thou
what
tis
to
forsake
the
ways
of
purity
the
which
he
loveth
and
wanton
with
such
as
be
worldly
and
an
offense
these
monks
did
enter
into
the
bath
and
come
thence
washed
as
white
as
snow
and
lo
in
that
moment
his
sign
appeared
in
miraculous
rebuke
for
his
insulted
waters
ceased
to
flow
and
utterly
vanished
away
they
fared
mildly
sandy
considering
how
that
kind
of
crime
is
regarded
in
this
country
belike
but
it
was
their
first
sin
and
they
had
been
of
perfect
life
for
long
and
differing
in
naught
from
the
angels
prayers
tears
torturings
of
the
flesh
all
was
vain
to
beguile
that
water
to
flow
again
even
processions
even
burntofferings
even
votive
candles
to
the
virgin
did
fail
every
each
of
them
and
all
in
the
land
did
marvel
how
odd
to
find
that
even
this
industry
has
its
financial
panics
and
at
times
sees
its
assignats
and
greenbacks
languish
to
zero
and
everything
come
to
a
standstill
go
on
sandy
and
so
upon
a
time
after
year
and
day
the
good
abbot
made
humble
surrender
and
destroyed
the
bath
and
behold
his
anger
was
in
that
moment
appeased
and
the
waters
gushed
richly
forth
again
and
even
unto
this
day
they
have
not
ceased
to
flow
in
that
generous
measure
then
i
take
it
nobody
has
washed
since
he
that
would
essay
it
could
have
his
halter
free
yes
and
swiftly
would
he
need
it
too
the
community
has
prospered
since
even
from
that
very
day
the
fame
of
the
miracle
went
abroad
into
all
lands
from
every
land
came
monks
to
join
they
came
even
as
the
fishes
come
in
shoals
and
the
monastery
added
building
to
building
and
yet
others
to
these
and
so
spread
wide
its
arms
and
took
them
in
and
nuns
came
also
and
more
again
and
yet
more
and
built
over
against
the
monastery
on
the
yon
side
of
the
vale
and
added
building
to
building
until
mighty
was
that
nunnery
and
these
were
friendly
unto
those
and
they
joined
their
loving
labors
together
and
together
they
built
a
fair
great
foundling
asylum
midway
of
the
valley
between
you
spoke
of
some
hermits
sandy
these
have
gathered
there
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
a
hermit
thriveth
best
where
there
be
multitudes
of
pilgrims
ye
shall
not
find
no
hermit
of
no
sort
wanting
if
any
shall
mention
a
hermit
of
a
kind
he
thinketh
new
and
not
to
be
found
but
in
some
far
strange
land
let
him
but
scratch
among
the
holes
and
caves
and
swamps
that
line
that
valley
of
holiness
and
whatsoever
be
his
breed
it
skills
not
he
shall
find
a
sample
of
it
there
i
closed
up
alongside
of
a
burly
fellow
with
a
fat
goodhumored
face
purposing
to
make
myself
agreeable
and
pick
up
some
further
crumbs
of
fact
but
i
had
hardly
more
than
scraped
acquaintance
with
him
when
he
began
eagerly
and
awkwardly
to
lead
up
in
the
immemorial
way
to
that
same
old
anecdotethe
one
sir
dinadan
told
me
what
time
i
got
into
trouble
with
sir
sagramor
and
was
challenged
of
him
on
account
of
it
i
excused
myself
and
dropped
to
the
rear
of
the
procession
sad
at
heart
willing
to
go
hence
from
this
troubled
life
this
vale
of
tears
this
brief
day
of
broken
rest
of
cloud
and
storm
of
weary
struggle
and
monotonous
defeat
and
yet
shrinking
from
the
change
as
remembering
how
long
eternity
is
and
how
many
have
wended
thither
who
know
that
anecdote
early
in
the
afternoon
we
overtook
another
procession
of
pilgrims
but
in
this
one
was
no
merriment
no
jokes
no
laughter
no
playful
ways
nor
any
happy
giddiness
whether
of
youth
or
age
yet
both
were
here
both
age
and
youth
gray
old
men
and
women
strong
men
and
women
of
middle
age
young
husbands
young
wives
little
boys
and
girls
and
three
babies
at
the
breast
even
the
children
were
smileless
there
was
not
a
face
among
all
these
half
a
hundred
people
but
was
cast
down
and
bore
that
set
expression
of
hopelessness
which
is
bred
of
long
and
hard
trials
and
old
acquaintance
with
despair
they
were
slaves
chains
led
from
their
fettered
feet
and
their
manacled
hands
to
a
soleleather
belt
about
their
waists
and
all
except
the
children
were
also
linked
together
in
a
file
six
feet
apart
by
a
single
chain
which
led
from
collar
to
collar
all
down
the
line
they
were
on
foot
and
had
tramped
three
hundred
miles
in
eighteen
days
upon
the
cheapest
odds
and
ends
of
food
and
stingy
rations
of
that
they
had
slept
in
these
chains
every
night
bundled
together
like
swine
they
had
upon
their
bodies
some
poor
rags
but
they
could
not
be
said
to
be
clothed
their
irons
had
chafed
the
skin
from
their
ankles
and
made
sores
which
were
ulcerated
and
wormy
their
naked
feet
were
torn
and
none
walked
without
a
limp
originally
there
had
been
a
hundred
of
these
unfortunates
but
about
half
had
been
sold
on
the
trip
the
trader
in
charge
of
them
rode
a
horse
and
carried
a
whip
with
a
short
handle
and
a
long
heavy
lash
divided
into
several
knotted
tails
at
the
end
with
this
whip
he
cut
the
shoulders
of
any
that
tottered
from
weariness
and
pain
and
straightened
them
up
he
did
not
speak
the
whip
conveyed
his
desire
without
that
none
of
these
poor
creatures
looked
up
as
we
rode
along
by
they
showed
no
consciousness
of
our
presence
and
they
made
no
sound
but
one
that
was
the
dull
and
awful
clank
of
their
chains
from
end
to
end
of
the
long
file
as
fortythree
burdened
feet
rose
and
fell
in
unison
the
file
moved
in
a
cloud
of
its
own
making
all
these
faces
were
gray
with
a
coating
of
dust
one
has
seen
the
like
of
this
coating
upon
furniture
in
unoccupied
houses
and
has
written
his
idle
thought
in
it
with
his
finger
i
was
reminded
of
this
when
i
noticed
the
faces
of
some
of
those
women
young
mothers
carrying
babes
that
were
near
to
death
and
freedom
how
a
something
in
their
hearts
was
written
in
the
dust
upon
their
faces
plain
to
see
and
lord
how
plain
to
read
for
it
was
the
track
of
tears
one
of
these
young
mothers
was
but
a
girl
and
it
hurt
me
to
the
heart
to
read
that
writing
and
reflect
that
it
was
come
up
out
of
the
breast
of
such
a
child
a
breast
that
ought
not
to
know
trouble
yet
but
only
the
gladness
of
the
morning
of
life
and
no
doubt
she
reeled
just
then
giddy
with
fatigue
and
down
came
the
lash
and
flicked
a
flake
of
skin
from
her
naked
shoulder
it
stung
me
as
if
i
had
been
hit
instead
the
master
halted
the
file
and
jumped
from
his
horse
he
stormed
and
swore
at
this
girl
and
said
she
had
made
annoyance
enough
with
her
laziness
and
as
this
was
the
last
chance
he
should
have
he
would
settle
the
account
now
she
dropped
on
her
knees
and
put
up
her
hands
and
began
to
beg
and
cry
and
implore
in
a
passion
of
terror
but
the
master
gave
no
attention
he
snatched
the
child
from
her
and
then
made
the
menslaves
who
were
chained
before
and
behind
her
throw
her
on
the
ground
and
hold
her
there
and
expose
her
body
and
then
he
laid
on
with
his
lash
like
a
madman
till
her
back
was
flayed
she
shrieking
and
struggling
the
while
piteously
one
of
the
men
who
was
holding
her
turned
away
his
face
and
for
this
humanity
he
was
reviled
and
flogged
all
our
pilgrims
looked
on
and
commentedon
the
expert
way
in
which
the
whip
was
handled
they
were
too
much
hardened
by
lifelong
everyday
familiarity
with
slavery
to
notice
that
there
was
anything
else
in
the
exhibition
that
invited
comment
this
was
what
slavery
could
do
in
the
way
of
ossifying
what
one
may
call
the
superior
lobe
of
human
feeling
for
these
pilgrims
were
kindhearted
people
and
they
would
not
have
allowed
that
man
to
treat
a
horse
like
that
i
wanted
to
stop
the
whole
thing
and
set
the
slaves
free
but
that
would
not
do
i
must
not
interfere
too
much
and
get
myself
a
name
for
riding
over
the
countrys
laws
and
the
citizens
rights
roughshod
if
i
lived
and
prospered
i
would
be
the
death
of
slavery
that
i
was
resolved
upon
but
i
would
try
to
fix
it
so
that
when
i
became
its
executioner
it
should
be
by
command
of
the
nation
just
here
was
the
wayside
shop
of
a
smith
and
now
arrived
a
landed
proprietor
who
had
bought
this
girl
a
few
miles
back
deliverable
here
where
her
irons
could
be
taken
off
they
were
removed
then
there
was
a
squabble
between
the
gentleman
and
the
dealer
as
to
which
should
pay
the
blacksmith
the
moment
the
girl
was
delivered
from
her
irons
she
flung
herself
all
tears
and
frantic
sobbings
into
the
arms
of
the
slave
who
had
turned
away
his
face
when
she
was
whipped
he
strained
her
to
his
breast
and
smothered
her
face
and
the
childs
with
kisses
and
washed
them
with
the
rain
of
his
tears
i
suspected
i
inquired
yes
i
was
right
it
was
husband
and
wife
they
had
to
be
torn
apart
by
force
the
girl
had
to
be
dragged
away
and
she
struggled
and
fought
and
shrieked
like
one
gone
mad
till
a
turn
of
the
road
hid
her
from
sight
and
even
after
that
we
could
still
make
out
the
fading
plaint
of
those
receding
shrieks
and
the
husband
and
father
with
his
wife
and
child
gone
never
to
be
seen
by
him
again
in
lifewell
the
look
of
him
one
might
not
bear
at
all
and
so
i
turned
away
but
i
knew
i
should
never
get
his
picture
out
of
my
mind
again
and
there
it
is
to
this
day
to
wring
my
heartstrings
whenever
i
think
of
it
we
put
up
at
the
inn
in
a
village
just
at
nightfall
and
when
i
rose
next
morning
and
looked
abroad
i
was
ware
where
a
knight
came
riding
in
the
golden
glory
of
the
new
day
and
recognized
him
for
knight
of
minesir
ozana
le
cure
hardy
he
was
in
the
gentlemens
furnishing
line
and
his
missionarying
specialty
was
plug
hats
he
was
clothed
all
in
steel
in
the
beautifulest
armor
of
the
timeup
to
where
his
helmet
ought
to
have
been
but
he
hadnt
any
helmet
he
wore
a
shiny
stovepipe
hat
and
was
ridiculous
a
spectacle
as
one
might
want
to
see
it
was
another
of
my
surreptitious
schemes
for
extinguishing
knighthood
by
making
it
grotesque
and
absurd
sir
ozanas
saddle
was
hung
about
with
leather
hat
boxes
and
every
time
he
overcame
a
wandering
knight
he
swore
him
into
my
service
and
fitted
him
with
a
plug
and
made
him
wear
it
i
dressed
and
ran
down
to
welcome
sir
ozana
and
get
his
news
how
is
trade
i
asked
ye
will
note
that
i
have
but
these
four
left
yet
were
they
sixteen
whenas
i
got
me
from
camelot
why
you
have
certainly
done
nobly
sir
ozana
where
have
you
been
foraging
of
late
i
am
but
now
come
from
the
valley
of
holiness
please
you
sir
i
am
pointed
for
that
place
myself
is
there
anything
stirring
in
the
monkery
more
than
common
by
the
mass
ye
may
not
question
it
give
him
good
feed
boy
and
stint
it
not
an
thou
valuest
thy
crown
so
get
ye
lightly
to
the
stable
and
do
even
as
i
bid
sir
it
is
parlous
news
i
bring
andbe
these
pilgrims
then
ye
may
not
do
better
good
folk
than
gather
and
hear
the
tale
i
have
to
tell
sith
it
concerneth
you
forasmuch
as
ye
go
to
find
that
ye
will
not
find
and
seek
that
ye
will
seek
in
vain
my
life
being
hostage
for
my
word
and
my
word
and
message
being
these
namely
that
a
hap
has
happened
whereof
the
like
has
not
been
seen
no
more
but
once
this
two
hundred
years
which
was
the
first
and
last
time
that
that
said
misfortune
strake
the
holy
valley
in
that
form
by
commandment
of
the
most
high
whereto
by
reasons
just
and
causes
thereunto
contributing
wherein
the
matter
the
miraculous
fount
hath
ceased
to
flow
this
shout
burst
from
twenty
pilgrim
mouths
at
once
ye
say
well
good
people
i
was
verging
to
it
even
when
ye
spake
has
somebody
been
washing
again
nay
it
is
suspected
but
none
believe
it
it
is
thought
to
be
some
other
sin
but
none
wit
what
how
are
they
feeling
about
the
calamity
none
may
describe
it
in
words
the
fount
is
these
nine
days
dry
the
prayers
that
did
begin
then
and
the
lamentations
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
and
the
holy
processions
none
of
these
have
ceased
nor
night
nor
day
and
so
the
monks
and
the
nuns
and
the
foundlings
be
all
exhausted
and
do
hang
up
prayers
writ
upon
parchment
sith
that
no
strength
is
left
in
man
to
lift
up
voice
and
at
last
they
sent
for
thee
sir
boss
to
try
magic
and
enchantment
and
if
you
could
not
come
then
was
the
messenger
to
fetch
merlin
and
he
is
there
these
three
days
now
and
saith
he
will
fetch
that
water
though
he
burst
the
globe
and
wreck
its
kingdoms
to
accomplish
it
and
right
bravely
doth
he
work
his
magic
and
call
upon
his
hellions
to
hie
them
hither
and
help
but
not
a
whiff
of
moisture
hath
he
started
yet
even
so
much
as
might
qualify
as
mist
upon
a
copper
mirror
an
ye
count
not
the
barrel
of
sweat
he
sweateth
betwixt
sun
and
sun
over
the
dire
labors
of
his
task
and
if
ye
breakfast
was
ready
as
soon
as
it
was
over
i
showed
to
sir
ozana
these
words
which
i
had
written
on
the
inside
of
his
hat

together
with
the
proper
complementary
detailsand
two
of
my
trained
assistants
and
i
said
now
get
you
to
camelot
as
fast
as
you
can
fly
brave
knight
and
show
the
writing
to
clarence
and
tell
him
to
have
these
required
matters
in
the
valley
of
holiness
with
all
possible
dispatch
i
will
well
sir
boss
and
he
was
off
chapter
xxii
the
holy
fountain
the
pilgrims
were
human
beings
otherwise
they
would
have
acted
differently
they
had
come
a
long
and
difficult
journey
and
now
when
the
journey
was
nearly
finished
and
they
learned
that
the
main
thing
they
had
come
for
had
ceased
to
exist
they
didnt
do
as
horses
or
cats
or
angleworms
would
probably
have
doneturn
back
and
get
at
something
profitableno
anxious
as
they
had
before
been
to
see
the
miraculous
fountain
they
were
as
much
as
forty
times
as
anxious
now
to
see
the
place
where
it
had
used
to
be
there
is
no
accounting
for
human
beings
we
made
good
time
and
a
couple
of
hours
before
sunset
we
stood
upon
the
high
confines
of
the
valley
of
holiness
and
our
eyes
swept
it
from
end
to
end
and
noted
its
features
that
is
its
large
features
these
were
the
three
masses
of
buildings
they
were
distant
and
isolated
temporalities
shrunken
to
toy
constructions
in
the
lonely
waste
of
what
seemed
a
desertand
was
such
a
scene
is
always
mournful
it
is
so
impressively
still
and
looks
so
steeped
in
death
but
there
was
a
sound
here
which
interrupted
the
stillness
only
to
add
to
its
mournfulness
this
was
the
faint
far
sound
of
tolling
bells
which
floated
fitfully
to
us
on
the
passing
breeze
and
so
faintly
so
softly
that
we
hardly
knew
whether
we
heard
it
with
our
ears
or
with
our
spirits
we
reached
the
monastery
before
dark
and
there
the
males
were
given
lodging
but
the
women
were
sent
over
to
the
nunnery
the
bells
were
close
at
hand
now
and
their
solemn
booming
smote
upon
the
ear
like
a
message
of
doom
a
superstitious
despair
possessed
the
heart
of
every
monk
and
published
itself
in
his
ghastly
face
everywhere
these
blackrobed
softsandaled
tallowvisaged
specters
appeared
flitted
about
and
disappeared
noiseless
as
the
creatures
of
a
troubled
dream
and
as
uncanny
the
old
abbots
joy
to
see
me
was
pathetic
even
to
tears
but
he
did
the
shedding
himself
he
said
delay
not
son
but
get
to
thy
saving
work
an
we
bring
not
the
water
back
again
and
soon
we
are
ruined
and
the
good
work
of
two
hundred
years
must
end
and
see
thou
do
it
with
enchantments
that
be
holy
for
the
church
will
not
endure
that
work
in
her
cause
be
done
by
devils
magic
when
i
work
father
be
sure
there
will
be
no
devils
work
connected
with
it
i
shall
use
no
arts
that
come
of
the
devil
and
no
elements
not
created
by
the
hand
of
god
but
is
merlin
working
strictly
on
pious
lines
ah
he
said
he
would
my
son
he
said
he
would
and
took
oath
to
make
his
promise
good
well
in
that
case
let
him
proceed
but
surely
you
will
not
sit
idle
by
but
help
it
will
not
answer
to
mix
methods
father
neither
would
it
be
professional
courtesy
two
of
a
trade
must
not
underbid
each
other
we
might
as
well
cut
rates
and
be
done
with
it
it
would
arrive
at
that
in
the
end
merlin
has
the
contract
no
other
magician
can
touch
it
till
he
throws
it
up
but
i
will
take
it
from
him
it
is
a
terrible
emergency
and
the
act
is
thereby
justified
and
if
it
were
not
so
who
will
give
law
to
the
church
the
church
giveth
law
to
all
and
what
she
wills
to
do
that
she
may
do
hurt
whom
it
may
i
will
take
it
from
him
you
shall
begin
upon
the
moment
it
may
not
be
father
no
doubt
as
you
say
where
power
is
supreme
one
can
do
as
one
likes
and
suffer
no
injury
but
we
poor
magicians
are
not
so
situated
merlin
is
a
very
good
magician
in
a
small
way
and
has
quite
a
neat
provincial
reputation
he
is
struggling
along
doing
the
best
he
can
and
it
would
not
be
etiquette
for
me
to
take
his
job
until
he
himself
abandons
it
the
abbots
face
lighted
ah
that
is
simple
there
are
ways
to
persuade
him
to
abandon
it
nono
father
it
skills
not
as
these
people
say
if
he
were
persuaded
against
his
will
he
would
load
that
well
with
a
malicious
enchantment
which
would
balk
me
until
i
found
out
its
secret
it
might
take
a
month
i
could
set
up
a
little
enchantment
of
mine
which
i
call
the
telephone
and
he
could
not
find
out
its
secret
in
a
hundred
years
yes
you
perceive
he
might
block
me
for
a
month
would
you
like
to
risk
a
month
in
a
dry
time
like
this
a
month
the
mere
thought
of
it
maketh
me
to
shudder
have
it
thy
way
my
son
but
my
heart
is
heavy
with
this
disappointment
leave
me
and
let
me
wear
my
spirit
with
weariness
and
waiting
even
as
i
have
done
these
ten
long
days
counterfeiting
thus
the
thing
that
is
called
rest
the
prone
body
making
outward
sign
of
repose
where
inwardly
is
none
of
course
it
would
have
been
best
all
round
for
merlin
to
waive
etiquette
and
quit
and
call
it
half
a
day
since
he
would
never
be
able
to
start
that
water
for
he
was
a
true
magician
of
the
time
which
is
to
say
the
big
miracles
the
ones
that
gave
him
his
reputation
always
had
the
luck
to
be
performed
when
nobody
but
merlin
was
present
he
couldnt
start
this
well
with
all
this
crowd
around
to
see
a
crowd
was
as
bad
for
a
magicians
miracle
in
that
day
as
it
was
for
a
spiritualists
miracle
in
mine
there
was
sure
to
be
some
skeptic
on
hand
to
turn
up
the
gas
at
the
crucial
moment
and
spoil
everything
but
i
did
not
want
merlin
to
retire
from
the
job
until
i
was
ready
to
take
hold
of
it
effectively
myself
and
i
could
not
do
that
until
i
got
my
things
from
camelot
and
that
would
take
two
or
three
days
my
presence
gave
the
monks
hope
and
cheered
them
up
a
good
deal
insomuch
that
they
ate
a
square
meal
that
night
for
the
first
time
in
ten
days
as
soon
as
their
stomachs
had
been
properly
reinforced
with
food
their
spirits
began
to
rise
fast
when
the
mead
began
to
go
round
they
rose
faster
by
the
time
everybody
was
halfseas
over
the
holy
community
was
in
good
shape
to
make
a
night
of
it
so
we
stayed
by
the
board
and
put
it
through
on
that
line
matters
got
to
be
very
jolly
good
old
questionable
stories
were
told
that
made
the
tears
run
down
and
cavernous
mouths
stand
wide
and
the
round
bellies
shake
with
laughter
and
questionable
songs
were
bellowed
out
in
a
mighty
chorus
that
drowned
the
boom
of
the
tolling
bells
at
last
i
ventured
a
story
myself
and
vast
was
the
success
of
it
not
right
off
of

the

not
as
a
rule
dissolve
upon
the
early
applications
of
a
humorous
thing
but
the
fifth
time
i
told
it
they
began
to
crack
in
places
the
eight
time
i
told
it
they
began
to
crumble
at
the
twelfth
repetition
they
fell
apart
in
chunks
and
at
the
fifteenth
they
disintegrated
and
i
got
a
broom
and
swept
them
up
this
language

figurative
those
islanderswell
they
are
slow
pay
at
first
in
the
matter
of
return
for
your
investment
of
effort
but
in
the
end
they
make
the
pay
of
all
other
nations
poor
and
small
by
contrast
i
was
at
the
well
next
day
betimes
merlin
was
there
enchanting
away
like
a
beaver
but
not
raising
the
moisture
he
was
not
in
a
pleasant
humor
and
every
time
i
hinted
that
perhaps
this
contract
was
a
shade
too
hefty
for
a
novice
he
unlimbered
his
tongue
and
cursed
like
a
bishopfrench
bishop
of
the
regency
days
i
mean
matters
were
about
as
i
expected
to
find
them
the
fountain
was
an
ordinary
well
it
had
been
dug
in
the
ordinary
way
and
stoned
up
in
the
ordinary
way
there
was
no
miracle
about
it
even
the
lie
that
had
created
its
reputation
was
not
miraculous
i
could
have
told
it
myself
with
one
hand
tied
behind
me
the
well
was
in
a
dark
chamber
which
stood
in
the
center
of
a
cutstone
chapel
whose
walls
were
hung
with
pious
pictures
of
a
workmanship
that
would
have
made
a
chromo
feel
good
pictures
historically
commemorative
of
curative
miracles
which
had
been
achieved
by
the
waters
when
nobody
was
looking
that
is
nobody
but
angels
they
are
always
on
deck
when
there
is
a
miracle
to
the
foreso
as
to
get
put
in
the
picture
perhaps
angels
are
as
fond
of
that
as
a
fire
company
look
at
the
old
masters
the
wellchamber
was
dimly
lighted
by
lamps
the
water
was
drawn
with
a
windlass
and
chain
by
monks
and
poured
into
troughs
which
delivered
it
into
stone
reservoirs
outside
in
the
chapelwhen
there
was
water
to
draw
i
meanand
none
but
monks
could
enter
the
wellchamber
i
entered
it
for
i
had
temporary
authority
to
do
so
by
courtesy
of
my
professional
brother
and
subordinate
but
he
hadnt
entered
it
himself
he
did
everything
by
incantations
he
never
worked
his
intellect
if
he
had
stepped
in
there
and
used
his
eyes
instead
of
his
disordered
mind
he
could
have
cured
the
well
by
natural
means
and
then
turned
it
into
a
miracle
in
the
customary
way
but
no
he
was
an
old
numskull
a
magician
who
believed
in
his
own
magic
and
no
magician
can
thrive
who
is
handicapped
with
a
superstition
like
that
i
had
an
idea
that
the
well
had
sprung
a
leak
that
some
of
the
wall
stones
near
the
bottom
had
fallen
and
exposed
fissures
that
allowed
the
water
to
escape
i
measured
the
chain98
feet
then
i
called
in
a
couple
of
monks
locked
the
door
took
a
candle
and
made
them
lower
me
in
the
bucket
when
the
chain
was
all
paid
out
the
candle
confirmed
my
suspicion
a
considerable
section
of
the
wall
was
gone
exposing
a
good
big
fissure
i
almost
regretted
that
my
theory
about
the
wells
trouble
was
correct
because
i
had
another
one
that
had
a
showy
point
or
two
about
it
for
a
miracle
i
remembered
that
in
america
many
centuries
later
when
an
oil
well
ceased
to
flow
they
used
to
blast
it
out
with
a
dynamite
torpedo
if
i
should
find
this
well
dry
and
no
explanation
of
it
i
could
astonish
these
people
most
nobly
by
having
a
person
of
no
especial
value
drop
a
dynamite
bomb
into
it
it
was
my
idea
to
appoint
merlin
however
it
was
plain
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
the
bomb
one
cannot
have
everything
the
way
he
would
like
it
a
man
has
no
business
to
be
depressed
by
a
disappointment
anyway
he
ought
to
make
up
his
mind
to
get
even
that
is
what
i
did
i
said
to
myself
i
am
in
no
hurry
i
can
wait
that
bomb
will
come
good
yet
and
it
did
too
when
i
was
above
ground
again
i
turned
out
the
monks
and
let
down
a
fishline
the
well
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
deep
and
there
was
fortyone
feet
of
water
in
it
i
called
in
a
monk
and
asked
how
deep
is
the
well
that
sir
i
wit
not
having
never
been
told
how
does
the
water
usually
stand
in
it
near
to
the
top
these
two
centuries
as
the
testimony
goeth
brought
down
to
us
through
our
predecessors
it
was
trueas
to
recent
times
at
leastfor
there
was
witness
to
it
and
better
witness
than
a
monk
only
about
twenty
or
thirty
feet
of
the
chain
showed
wear
and
use
the
rest
of
it
was
unworn
and
rusty
what
had
happened
when
the
well
gave
out
that
other
time
without
doubt
some
practical
person
had
come
along
and
mended
the
leak
and
then
had
come
up
and
told
the
abbot
he
had
discovered
by
divination
that
if
the
sinful
bath
were
destroyed
the
well
would
flow
again
the
leak
had
befallen
again
now
and
these
children
would
have
prayed
and
processioned
and
tolled
their
bells
for
heavenly
succor
till
they
all
dried
up
and
blew
away
and
no
innocent
of
them
all
would
ever
have
thought
to
drop
a
fishline
into
the
well
or
go
down
in
it
and
find
out
what
was
really
the
matter
old
habit
of
mind
is
one
of
the
toughest
things
to
get
away
from
in
the
world
it
transmits
itself
like
physical
form
and
feature
and
for
a
man
in
those
days
to
have
had
an
idea
that
his
ancestors
hadnt
had
would
have
brought
him
under
suspicion
of
being
illegitimate
i
said
to
the
monk
it
is
a
difficult
miracle
to
restore
water
in
a
dry
well
but
we
will
try
if
my
brother
merlin
fails
brother
merlin
is
a
very
passable
artist
but
only
in
the
parlormagic
line
and
he
may
not
succeed
in
fact
is
not
likely
to
succeed
but
that
should
be
nothing
to
his
discredit
the
man
that
can
do
this
kind
of
miracle
knows
enough
to
keep
hotel
hotel
i
mind
not

call

the
man
that
can
do
this
miracle

keep

i
can
do
this
miracle
i
shall
do
this
miracle
yet
i
do
not
try
to
conceal
from
you
that
it
is
a
miracle
to
tax
the
occult
powers
to
the
last
strain
none
knoweth
that
truth
better
than
the
brotherhood
indeed
for
it
is
of
record
that
aforetime
it
was
parlous
difficult
and
took
a
year
natheless
god
send
you
good
success
and
to
that
end
will
we
pray
as
a
matter
of
business
it
was
a
good
idea
to
get
the
notion
around
that
the
thing
was
difficult
many
a
small
thing
has
been
made
large
by
the
right
kind
of
advertising
that
monk
was
filled
up
with
the
difficulty
of
this
enterprise
he
would
fill
up
the
others
in
two
days
the
solicitude
would
be
booming
on
my
way
home
at
noon
i
met
sandy
she
had
been
sampling
the
hermits
i
said
i
would
like
to
do
that
myself
this
is
wednesday
is
there
a
matinee
a
which
please
you
sir
matinee
do
they
keep
open
afternoons
who
the
hermits
of
course
keep
open
yes
keep
open
isnt
that
plain
enough
do
they
knock
off
at
noon
knock
off
knock

knock
off
what
is
the
matter
with
knock
off
i
never
saw
such
a
dunderhead
cant
you
understand
anything
at
all
in
plain
terms
do
they
shut
up
shop
draw
the
game
bank
the
fires
shut
up
shop
draw
there
never
mind
let
it
go
you
make
me
tired
you
cant
seem
to
understand
the
simplest
thing
i
would
i
might
please
thee
sir
and
it
is
to
me
dole
and
sorrow
that
i
fail
albeit
sith
i
am
but
a
simple
damsel
and
taught
of
none
being
from
the
cradle
unbaptized
in
those
deep
waters
of
learning
that
do
anoint
with
a
sovereignty
him
that
partaketh
of
that
most
noble
sacrament
investing
him
with
reverend
state
to
the
mental
eye
of
the
humble
mortal
who
by
bar
and
lack
of
that
great
consecration
seeth
in
his
own
unlearned
estate
but
a
symbol
of
that
other
sort
of
lack
and
loss
which
men
do
publish
to
the
pitying
eye
with
sackcloth
trappings
whereon
the
ashes
of
grief
do
lie
bepowdered
and
bestrewn
and
so
when
such
shall
in
the
darkness
of
his
mind
encounter
these
golden
phrases
of
high
mystery
these
shutupshops
and
drawthegame
and
bankthefires
it
is
but
by
the
grace
of
god
that
he
burst
not
for
envy
of
the
mind
that
can
beget
and
tongue
that
can
deliver
so
great
and
mellowsounding
miracles
of
speech
and
if
there
do
ensue
confusion
in
that
humbler
mind
and
failure
to
divine
the
meanings
of
these
wonders
then
if
so
be
this
miscomprehension
is
not
vain
but
sooth
and
true
wit
ye
well
it
is
the
very
substance
of
worshipful
dear
homage
and
may
not
lightly
be
misprized
nor
had
been
an
ye
had
noted
this
complexion
of
mood
and
mind
and
understood
that
that
i
would
i
could
not
and
that
i
could
not
i
might
not
nor
yet
nor
might
nor
could
nor
mightnot
nor
couldnot
might
be
by
advantage
turned
to
the
desired
would
and
so
i
pray
you
mercy
of
my
fault
and
that
ye
will
of
your
kindness
and
your
charity
forgive
it
good
my
master
and
most
dear
lord
i
couldnt
make
it
all
outthat
is
the
detailsbut
i
got
the
general
idea
and
enough
of
it
too
to
be
ashamed
it
was
not
fair
to
spring
those
nineteenth
century
technicalities
upon
the
untutored
infant
of
the
sixth
and
then
rail
at
her
because
she
couldnt
get
their
drift
and
when
she
was
making
the
honest
best
drive
at
it
she
could
too
and
no
fault
of
hers
that
she
couldnt
fetch
the
home
plate
and
so
i
apologized
then
we
meandered
pleasantly
away
toward
the
hermit
holes
in
sociable
converse
together
and
better
friends
than
ever
i
was
gradually
coming
to
have
a
mysterious
and
shuddery
reverence
for
this
girl
nowadays
whenever
she
pulled
out
from
the
station
and
got
her
train
fairly
started
on
one
of
those
horizonless
transcontinental
sentences
of
hers
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
i
was
standing
in
the
awful
presence
of
the
mother
of
the
german
language
i
was
so
impressed
with
this
that
sometimes
when
she
began
to
empty
one
of
these
sentences
on
me
i
unconsciously
took
the
very
attitude
of
reverence
and
stood
uncovered
and
if
words
had
been
water
i
had
been
drowned
sure
she
had
exactly
the
german
way
whatever
was
in
her
mind
to
be
delivered
whether
a
mere
remark
or
a
sermon
or
a
cyclopedia
or
the
history
of
a
war
she
would
get
it
into
a
single
sentence
or
die
whenever
the
literary
german
dives
into
a
sentence
that
is
the
last
you
are
going
to
see
of
him
till
he
emerges
on
the
other
side
of
his
atlantic
with
his
verb
in
his
mouth
we
drifted
from
hermit
to
hermit
all
the
afternoon
it
was
a
most
strange
menagerie
the
chief
emulation
among
them
seemed
to
be
to
see
which
could
manage
to
be
the
uncleanest
and
most
prosperous
with
vermin
their
manner
and
attitudes
were
the
last
expression
of
complacent
selfrighteousness
it
was
one
anchorites
pride
to
lie
naked
in
the
mud
and
let
the
insects
bite
him
and
blister
him
unmolested
it
was
anothers
to
lean
against
a
rock
all
day
long
conspicuous
to
the
admiration
of
the
throng
of
pilgrims
and
pray
it
was
anothers
to
go
naked
and
crawl
around
on
all
fours
it
was
anothers
to
drag
about
with
him
year
in
and
year
out
eighty
pounds
of
iron
it
was
anothers
to
never
lie
down
when
he
slept
but
to
stand
among
the
thornbushes
and
snore
when
there
were
pilgrims
around
to
look
a
woman
who
had
the
white
hair
of
age
and
no
other
apparel
was
black
from
crown
to
heel
with
fortyseven
years
of
holy
abstinence
from
water
groups
of
gazing
pilgrims
stood
around
all
and
every
of
these
strange
objects
lost
in
reverent
wonder
and
envious
of
the
fleckless
sanctity
which
these
pious
austerities
had
won
for
them
from
an
exacting
heaven
by
and
by
we
went
to
see
one
of
the
supremely
great
ones
he
was
a
mighty
celebrity
his
fame
had
penetrated
all
christendom
the
noble
and
the
renowned
journeyed
from
the
remotest
lands
on
the
globe
to
pay
him
reverence
his
stand
was
in
the
center
of
the
widest
part
of
the
valley
and
it
took
all
that
space
to
hold
his
crowds
his
stand
was
a
pillar
sixty
feet
high
with
a
broad
platform
on
the
top
of
it
he
was
now
doing
what
he
had
been
doing
every
day
for
twenty
years
up
therebowing
his
body
ceaselessly
and
rapidly
almost
to
his
feet
it
was
his
way
of
praying
i
timed
him
with
a
stop
watch
and
he
made
1244
revolutions
in
24
minutes
and
46
seconds
it
seemed
a
pity
to
have
all
this
power
going
to
waste
it
was
one
of
the
most
useful
motions
in
mechanics
the
pedal
movement
so
i
made
a
note
in
my
memorandum
book
purposing
some
day
to
apply
a
system
of
elastic
cords
to
him
and
run
a
sewing
machine
with
it
i
afterward
carried
out
that
scheme
and
got
five
years
good
service
out
of
him
in
which
time
he
turned
out
upward
of
eighteen
thousand
firstrate
towlinen
shirts
which
was
ten
a
day
i
worked
him
sundays
and
all
he
was
going
sundays
the
same
as
week
days
and
it
was
no
use
to
waste
the
power
these
shirts
cost
me
nothing
but
just
the
mere
trifle
for
the
materialsi
furnished
those
myself
it
would
not
have
been
right
to
make
him
do
thatand
they
sold
like
smoke
to
pilgrims
at
a
dollar
and
a
half
apiece
which
was
the
price
of
fifty
cows
or
a
blooded
race
horse
in
arthurdom
they
were
regarded
as
a
perfect
protection
against
sin
and
advertised
as
such
by
my
knights
everywhere
with
the
paintpot
and
stencilplate
insomuch
that
there
was
not
a
cliff
or
a
bowlder
or
a
dead
wall
in
england
but
you
could
read
on
it
at
a
mile
distance
buy
the
only
genuine
st
stylite
patronized
by
the
nobility
patent
applied
for
there
was
more
money
in
the
business
than
one
knew
what
to
do
with
as
it
extended
i
brought
out
a
line
of
goods
suitable
for
kings
and
a
nobby
thing
for
duchesses
and
that
sort
with
ruffles
down
the
forehatch
and
the
runninggear
clewed
up
with
a
featherstitch
to
leeward
and
then
hauled
aft
with
a
backstay
and
triced
up
with
a
halfturn
in
the
standing
rigging
forward
of
the
weathergaskets
yes
it
was
a
daisy
but
about
that
time
i
noticed
that
the
motive
power
had
taken
to
standing
on
one
leg
and
i
found
that
there
was
something
the
matter
with
the
other
one
so
i
stocked
the
business
and
unloaded
taking
sir
bors
de
ganis
into
camp
financially
along
with
certain
of
his
friends
for
the
works
stopped
within
a
year
and
the
good
saint
got
him
to
his
rest
but
he
had
earned
it
i
can
say
that
for
him
when
i
saw
him
that
first
timehowever
his
personal
condition
will
not
quite
bear
description
here
you
can
read

of

restoration
of
the
fountain
saturday
noon
i
went
to
the
well
and
looked
on
a
while
merlin
was
still
burning
smokepowders
and
pawing
the
air
and
muttering
gibberish
as
hard
as
ever
but
looking
pretty
downhearted
for
of
course
he
had
not
started
even
a
perspiration
in
that
well
yet
finally
i
said
how
does
the
thing
promise
by
this
time
partner
behold
i
am
even
now
busied
with
trial
of
the
powerfulest
enchantment
known
to
the
princes
of
the
occult
arts
in
the
lands
of
the
east
an
it
fail
me
naught
can
avail
peace
until
i
finish
he
raised
a
smoke
this
time
that
darkened
all
the
region
and
must
have
made
matters
uncomfortable
for
the
hermits
for
the
wind
was
their
way
and
it
rolled
down
over
their
dens
in
a
dense
and
billowy
fog
he
poured
out
volumes
of
speech
to
match
and
contorted
his
body
and
sawed
the
air
with
his
hands
in
a
most
extraordinary
way
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
he
dropped
down
panting
and
about
exhausted
now
arrived
the
abbot
and
several
hundred
monks
and
nuns
and
behind
them
a
multitude
of
pilgrims
and
a
couple
of
acres
of
foundlings
all
drawn
by
the
prodigious
smoke
and
all
in
a
grand
state
of
excitement
the
abbot
inquired
anxiously
for
results
merlin
said
if
any
labor
of
mortal
might
break
the
spell
that
binds
these
waters
this
which
i
have
but
just
essayed
had
done
it
it
has
failed
whereby
i
do
now
know
that
that
which
i
had
feared
is
a
truth
established
the
sign
of
this
failure
is
that
the
most
potent
spirit
known
to
the
magicians
of
the
east
and
whose
name
none
may
utter
and
live
has
laid
his
spell
upon
this
well
the
mortal
does
not
breathe
nor
ever
will
who
can
penetrate
the
secret
of
that
spell
and
without
that
secret
none
can
break
it
the
water
will
flow
no
more
forever
good
father
i
have
done
what
man
could
suffer
me
to
go
of
course
this
threw
the
abbot
into
a
good
deal
of
a
consternation
he
turned
to
me
with
the
signs
of
it
in
his
face
and
said
ye
have
heard
him
is
it
true
part
of
it
is
not
all
then
not
all
what
part
is
true
that
that
spirit
with
the
russian
name
has
put
his
spell
upon
the
well
gods
wounds
then
are
we
ruined
possibly
but
not
certainly
ye
mean
not
certainly
that
is
it
wherefore
ye
also
mean
that
when
he
saith
none
can
break
the
spell
yes
when
he
says
that
he
says
what
isnt
necessarily
true
there
are
conditions
under
which
an
effort
to
break
it
may
have
some
chancethat
is
some
small
some
trifling
chanceof
success
the
conditions
oh
they
are
nothing
difficult
only
these
i
want
the
well
and
the
surroundings
for
the
space
of
half
a
mile
entirely
to
myself
from
sunset
today
until
i
remove
the
banand
nobody
allowed
to
cross
the
ground
but
by
my
authority
are
these
all
yes
and
you
have
no
fear
to
try
oh
none
one
may
fail
of
course
and
one
may
also
succeed
one
can
try
and
i
am
ready
to
chance
it
i
have
my
conditions
these
and
all
others
ye
may
name
i
will
issue
commandment
to
that
effect
wait
said
merlin
with
an
evil
smile
ye
wit
that
he
that
would
break
this
spell
must
know
that
spirits
name
yes
i
know
his
name
and
wit
you
also
that
to
know
it
skills
not
of
itself
but
ye
must
likewise
pronounce
it
haha
knew
ye
that
yes
i
knew
that
too
you
had
that
knowledge
art
a
fool
are
ye
minded
to
utter
that
name
and
die
utter
it
why
certainly
i
would
utter
it
if
it
was
welsh
ye
are
even
a
dead
man
then
and
i
go
to
tell
arthur
thats
all
right
take
your
gripsack
and
get
along
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
go
home
and
work
the
weather
john
w
merlin
it
was
a
home
shot
and
it
made
him
wince
for
he
was
the
worst
weatherfailure
in
the
kingdom
whenever
he
ordered
up
the
dangersignals
along
the
coast
there
was
a
weeks
dead
calm
sure
and
every
time
he
prophesied
fair
weather
it
rained
brickbats
but
i
kept
him
in
the
weather
bureau
right
along
to
undermine
his
reputation
however
that
shot
raised
his
bile
and
instead
of
starting
home
to
report
my
death
he
said
he
would
remain
and
enjoy
it
my
two
experts
arrived
in
the
evening
and
pretty
well
fagged
for
they
had
traveled
double
tides
they
had
packmules
along
and
had
brought
everything
i
neededtools
pump
lead
pipe
greek
fire
sheaves
of
big
rockets
roman
candles
colored
fire
sprays
electric
apparatus
and
a
lot
of
sundrieseverything
necessary
for
the
stateliest
kind
of
a
miracle
they
got
their
supper
and
a
nap
and
about
midnight
we
sallied
out
through
a
solitude
so
wholly
vacant
and
complete
that
it
quite
overpassed
the
required
conditions
we
took
possession
of
the
well
and
its
surroundings
my
boys
were
experts
in
all
sorts
of
things
from
the
stoning
up
of
a
well
to
the
constructing
of
a
mathematical
instrument
an
hour
before
sunrise
we
had
that
leak
mended
in
shipshape
fashion
and
the
water
began
to
rise
then
we
stowed
our
fireworks
in
the
chapel
locked
up
the
place
and
went
home
to
bed
before
the
noon
mass
was
over
we
were
at
the
well
again
for
there
was
a
deal
to
do
yet
and
i
was
determined
to
spring
the
miracle
before
midnight
for
business
reasons
for
whereas
a
miracle
worked
for
the
church
on
a
weekday
is
worth
a
good
deal
it
is
worth
six
times
as
much
if
you
get
it
in
on
a
sunday
in
nine
hours
the
water
had
risen
to
its
customary
levelthat
is
to
say
it
was
within
twentythree
feet
of
the
top
we
put
in
a
little
iron
pump
one
of
the
first
turned
out
by
my
works
near
the
capital
we
bored
into
a
stone
reservoir
which
stood
against
the
outer
wall
of
the
wellchamber
and
inserted
a
section
of
lead
pipe
that
was
long
enough
to
reach
to
the
door
of
the
chapel
and
project
beyond
the
threshold
where
the
gushing
water
would
be
visible
to
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
acres
of
people
i
was
intending
should
be
present
on
the
flat
plain
in
front
of
this
little
holy
hillock
at
the
proper
time
we
knocked
the
head
out
of
an
empty
hogshead
and
hoisted
this
hogshead
to
the
flat
roof
of
the
chapel
where
we
clamped
it
down
fast
poured
in
gunpowder
till
it
lay
loosely
an
inch
deep
on
the
bottom
then
we
stood
up
rockets
in
the
hogshead
as
thick
as
they
could
loosely
stand
all
the
different
breeds
of
rockets
there
are
and
they
made
a
portly
and
imposing
sheaf
i
can
tell
you
we
grounded
the
wire
of
a
pocket
electrical
battery
in
that
powder
we
placed
a
whole
magazine
of
greek
fire
on
each
corner
of
the
roofblue
on
one
corner
green
on
another
red
on
another
and
purple
on
the
lastand
grounded
a
wire
in
each
about
two
hundred
yards
off
in
the
flat
we
built
a
pen
of
scantlings
about
four
feet
high
and
laid
planks
on
it
and
so
made
a
platform
we
covered
it
with
swell
tapestries
borrowed
for
the
occasion
and
topped
it
off
with
the
abbots
own
throne
when
you
are
going
to
do
a
miracle
for
an
ignorant
race
you
want
to
get
in
every
detail
that
will
count
you
want
to
make
all
the
properties
impressive
to
the
public
eye
you
want
to
make
matters
comfortable
for
your
head
guest
then
you
can
turn
yourself
loose
and
play
your
effects
for
all
they
are
worth
i
know
the
value
of
these
things
for
i
know
human
nature
you
cant
throw
too
much
style
into
a
miracle
it
costs
trouble
and
work
and
sometimes
money
but
it
pays
in
the
end
well
we
brought
the
wires
to
the
ground
at
the
chapel
and
then
brought
them
under
the
ground
to
the
platform
and
hid
the
batteries
there
we
put
a
rope
fence
a
hundred
feet
square
around
the
platform
to
keep
off
the
common
multitude
and
that
finished
the
work
my
idea
was
doors
open
at
1030
performance
to
begin
at
1125
sharp
i
wished
i
could
charge
admission
but
of
course
that
wouldnt
answer
i
instructed
my
boys
to
be
in
the
chapel
as
early
as
10
before
anybody
was
around
and
be
ready
to
man
the
pumps
at
the
proper
time
and
make
the
fur
fly
then
we
went
home
to
supper
the
news
of
the
disaster
to
the
well
had
traveled
far
by
this
time
and
now
for
two
or
three
days
a
steady
avalanche
of
people
had
been
pouring
into
the
valley
the
lower
end
of
the
valley
was
become
one
huge
camp
we
should
have
a
good
house
no
question
about
that
criers
went
the
rounds
early
in
the
evening
and
announced
the
coming
attempt
which
put
every
pulse
up
to
fever
heat
they
gave
notice
that
the
abbot
and
his
official
suite
would
move
in
state
and
occupy
the
platform
at
1030
up
to
which
time
all
the
region
which
was
under
my
ban
must
be
clear
the
bells
would
then
cease
from
tolling
and
this
sign
should
be
permission
to
the
multitudes
to
close
in
and
take
their
places
i
was
at
the
platform
and
all
ready
to
do
the
honors
when
the
abbots
solemn
procession
hove
in
sightwhich
it
did
not
do
till
it
was
nearly
to
the
rope
fence
because
it
was
a
starless
black
night
and
no
torches
permitted
with
it
came
merlin
and
took
a
front
seat
on
the
platform
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
for
once
one
could
not
see
the
multitudes
banked
together
beyond
the
ban
but
they
were
there
just
the
same
the
moment
the
bells
stopped
those
banked
masses
broke
and
poured
over
the
line
like
a
vast
black
wave
and
for
as
much
as
a
half
hour
it
continued
to
flow
and
then
it
solidified
itself
and
you
could
have
walked
upon
a
pavement
of
human
heads

for

twenty
minutesa
thing
i
had
counted
on
for
effect
it
is
always
good
to
let
your
audience
have
a
chance
to
work
up
its
expectancy
at

and
swelled
up
and
rolled
away
into
the
night
a
majestic
tide
of
melody
i
had
put
that
up
too
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
effects
i
ever
invented
when
it
was
finished
i
stood
up
on
the
platform
and
extended
my
hands
abroad
for
two
minutes
with
my
face
upliftedthat
always
produces
a
dead
hushand
then
slowly
pronounced
this
ghastly
word
with
a
kind
of
awfulness
which
caused
hundreds
to
tremble
and
many
women
to
faint

just
as
i
was
moaning
out
the
closing
hunks
of
that
word
i
touched
off
one
of
my
electric
connections
and
all
that
murky
world
of
people
stood
revealed
in
a
hideous
blue
glare
it
was
immense
that

up
and

the

and
the
monks
crossed
themselves
nimbly
and
their

with
agitated
prayers
merlin
held
his
grip
but
he
was
astonished
clear
down
to
his
corns
he
had
never
seen
anything
to
begin
with
that
before
now
was
the
time
to
pile
in
the

i
lifted
my

and
groaned

and
lit
up
the

after
waiting
only
forty
seconds
this
time
i
spread
my
arms
abroad
and
thundered
out
the
devastating
syllables
of
this
word
of
words

and
whirled
on
the
purple

there
they
were
all
going
at
once

furious

pouring

and
spreading

to
the
furthest
confines
of
that
valley
in
the
distance
one
could
see
that
fellow
on
the
pillar
standing
rigid
against
the
background
of
sky
his
seesaw
stopped
for
the
first
time
in
twenty
years
i
knew
the
boys
were
at
the
pump
now
and
ready
so
i
said
to
the
abbot
the
time
is
come
father
i
am
about
to
pronounce
the
dread
name
and
command
the
spell
to
dissolve
you
want
to
brace
up
and
take
hold
of
something
then
i
shouted
to
the
people
behold
in
another
minute
the
spell
will
be
broken
or
no
mortal
can
break
it
if
it
break
all
will
know
it
for
you
will
see
the
sacred
water
gush
from
the
chapel
door
i
stood
a
few
moments
to
let
the
hearers
have
a
chance
to
spread
my
announcement
to
those
who
couldnt
hear
and
so
convey
it
to
the
furthest
ranks
then
i
made
a
grand
exhibition
of
extra
posturing
and
gesturing
and
shouted
lo
i
command
the
fell
spirit
that
possesses
the
holy
fountain
to
now
disgorge
into
the
skies
all
the
infernal
fires
that
still
remain
in
him
and
straightway
dissolve
his
spell
and
flee
hence
to
the
pit
there
to
lie
bound
a
thousand
years
by
his
own
dread
name
i
command
itbgwjjilligkkk
then
i
touched
off
the
hogshead
of
rockets
and
a
vast
fountain
of
dazzling
lances
of
fire
vomited
itself
toward
the
zenith
with
a
hissing
rush
and
burst
in
midsky
into
a
storm
of
flashing
jewels
one
mighty
groan
of
terror
started
up
from
the
massed
people
then
suddenly
broke
into
a
wild
hosannah
of
joyfor
there
fair
and
plain
in
the
uncanny
glare
they
saw
the
freed
water
leaping
forth
the
old
abbot
could
not
speak
a
word
for
tears
and
the
chokings
in
his
throat
without
utterance
of
any
sort
he
folded
me
in
his
arms
and
mashed
me
it
was
more
eloquent
than
speech
and
harder
to
get
over
too
in
a
country
where
there
were
really
no
doctors
that
were
worth
a
damaged
nickel
you
should
have
seen
those
acres
of
people
throw
themselves
down
in
that
water
and
kiss
it
kiss
it
and
pet
it
and
fondle
it
and
talk
to
it
as
if
it
were
alive
and
welcome
it
back
with
the
dear
names
they
gave
their
darlings
just
as
if
it
had
been
a
friend
who
was
long
gone
away
and
lost
and
was
come
home
again
yes
it
was
pretty
to
see
and
made
me
think
more
of
them
than
i
had
done
before
i
sent
merlin
home
on
a
shutter
he
had
caved
in
and
gone
down
like
a
landslide
when
i
pronounced
that
fearful
name
and
had
never
come
to
since
he
never
had
heard
that
name
beforeneither
had
ibut
to
him
it
was
the
right
one
any
jumble
would
have
been
the
right
one
he
admitted
afterward
that
that
spirits
own
mother
could
not
have
pronounced
that
name
better
than
i
did
he
never
could
understand
how
i
survived
it
and
i
didnt
tell
him
it
is
only
young
magicians
that
give
away
a
secret
like
that
merlin
spent
three
months
working
enchantments
to
try
to
find
out
the
deep
trick
of
how
to
pronounce
that
name
and
outlive
it
but
he
didnt
arrive
when
i
started
to
the
chapel
the
populace
uncovered
and
fell
back
reverently
to
make
a
wide
way
for
me
as
if
i
had
been
some
kind
of
a
superior
beingand
i
was
i
was
aware
of
that
i
took
along
a
night
shift
of
monks
and
taught
them
the
mystery
of
the
pump
and
set
them
to
work
for
it
was
plain
that
a
good
part
of
the
people
out
there
were
going
to
sit
up
with
the
water
all
night
consequently
it
was
but
right
that
they
should
have
all
they
wanted
of
it
to
those
monks
that
pump
was
a
good
deal
of
a
miracle
itself
and
they
were
full
of
wonder
over
it
and
of
admiration
too
of
the
exceeding
effectiveness
of
its
performance
it
was
a
great
night
an
immense
night
there
was
reputation
in
it
i
could
hardly
get
to
sleep
for
glorying
over
it
chapter
xxiv
a
rival
magician
my
influence
in
the
valley
of
holiness
was
something
prodigious
now
it
seemed
worth
while
to
try
to
turn
it
to
some
valuable
account
the
thought
came
to
me
the
next
morning
and
was
suggested
by
my
seeing
one
of
my
knights
who
was
in
the
soap
line
come
riding
in
according
to
history
the
monks
of
this
place
two
centuries
before
had
been
worldly
minded
enough
to
want
to
wash
it
might
be
that
there
was
a
leaven
of
this
unrighteousness
still
remaining
so
i
sounded
a
brother
wouldnt
you
like
a
bath
he
shuddered
at
the
thoughtthe
thought
of
the
peril
of
it
to
the
wellbut
he
said
with
feeling
one
needs
not
to
ask
that
of
a
poor
body
who
has
not
known
that
blessed
refreshment
sith
that
he
was
a
boy
would
god
i
might
wash
me
but
it
may
not
be
fair
sir
tempt
me
not
it
is
forbidden
and
then
he
sighed
in
such
a
sorrowful
way
that
i
was
resolved
he
should
have
at
least
one
layer
of
his
real
estate
removed
if
it
sized
up
my
whole
influence
and
bankrupted
the
pile
so
i
went
to
the
abbot
and
asked
for
a
permit
for
this
brother
he
blenched
at
the
ideai
dont
mean
that
you
could
see
him
blench
for
of
course
you
couldnt
see
it
without
you
scraped
him
and
i
didnt
care
enough
about
it
to
scrape
him
but
i
knew
the
blench
was
there
just
the
same
and
within
a
bookcovers
thickness
of
the
surface
tooblenched
and
trembled
he
said
ah
son
ask
aught
else
thou
wilt
and
it
is
thine
and
freely
granted
out
of
a
grateful
heartbut
this
oh
this
would
you
drive
away
the
blessed
water
again
no
father
i
will
not
drive
it
away
i
have
mysterious
knowledge
which
teaches
me
that
there
was
an
error
that
other
time
when
it
was
thought
the
institution
of
the
bath
banished
the
fountain
a
large
interest
began
to
show
up
in
the
old
mans
face
my
knowledge
informs
me
that
the
bath
was
innocent
of
that
misfortune
which
was
caused
by
quite
another
sort
of
sin
these
are
brave
wordsbutbut
right
welcome
if
they
be
true
they
are
true
indeed
let
me
build
the
bath
again
father
let
me
build
it
again
and
the
fountain
shall
flow
forever
you
promise
thisyou
promise
it
say
the
wordsay
you
promise
it
i
do
promise
it
then
will
i
have
the
first
bath
myself
goget
ye
to
your
work
tarry
not
tarry
not
but
go
i
and
my
boys
were
at
work
straight
off
the
ruins
of
the
old
bath
were
there
yet
in
the
basement
of
the
monastery
not
a
stone
missing
they
had
been
left
just
so
all
these
lifetimes
and
avoided
with
a
pious
fear
as
things
accursed
in
two
days
we
had
it
all
done
and
the
water
ina
spacious
pool
of
clear
pure
water
that
a
body
could
swim
in
it
was
running
water
too
it
came
in
and
went
out
through
the
ancient
pipes
the
old
abbot
kept
his
word
and
was
the
first
to
try
it
he
went
down
black
and
shaky
leaving
the
whole
black
community
above
troubled
and
worried
and
full
of
bodings
but
he
came
back
white
and
joyful
and
the
game
was
made
another
triumph
scored
it
was
a
good
campaign
that
we
made
in
that
valley
of
holiness
and
i
was
very
well
satisfied
and
ready
to
move
on
now
but
i
struck
a
disappointment
i
caught
a
heavy
cold
and
it
started
up
an
old
lurking
rheumatism
of
mine
of
course
the
rheumatism
hunted
up
my
weakest
place
and
located
itself
there
this
was
the
place
where
the
abbot
put
his
arms
about
me
and
mashed
me
what
time
he
was
moved
to
testify
his
gratitude
to
me
with
an
embrace
when
at
last
i
got
out
i
was
a
shadow
but
everybody
was
full
of
attentions
and
kindnesses
and
these
brought
cheer
back
into
my
life
and
were
the
right
medicine
to
help
a
convalescent
swiftly
up
toward
health
and
strength
again
so
i
gained
fast
sandy
was
worn
out
with
nursing
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
turn
out
and
go
a
cruise
alone
leaving
her
at
the
nunnery
to
rest
up
my
idea
was
to
disguise
myself
as
a
freeman
of
peasant
degree
and
wander
through
the
country
a
week
or
two
on
foot
this
would
give
me
a
chance
to
eat
and
lodge
with
the
lowliest
and
poorest
class
of
free
citizens
on
equal
terms
there
was
no
other
way
to
inform
myself
perfectly
of
their
everyday
life
and
the
operation
of
the
laws
upon
it
if
i
went
among
them
as
a
gentleman
there
would
be
restraints
and
conventionalities
which
would
shut
me
out
from
their
private
joys
and
troubles
and
i
should
get
no
further
than
the
outside
shell
one
morning
i
was
out
on
a
long
walk
to
get
up
muscle
for
my
trip
and
had
climbed
the
ridge
which
bordered
the
northern
extremity
of
the
valley
when
i
came
upon
an
artificial
opening
in
the
face
of
a
low
precipice
and
recognized
it
by
its
location
as
a
hermitage
which
had
often
been
pointed
out
to
me
from
a
distance
as
the
den
of
a
hermit
of
high
renown
for
dirt
and
austerity
i
knew
he
had
lately
been
offered
a
situation
in
the
great
sahara
where
lions
and
sandflies
made
the
hermitlife
peculiarly
attractive
and
difficult
and
had
gone
to
africa
to
take
possession
so
i
thought
i
would
look
in
and
see
how
the
atmosphere
of
this
den
agreed
with
its
reputation
my
surprise
was
great
the
place
was
newly
swept
and
scoured
then
there
was
another
surprise
back
in
the
gloom
of
the
cavern
i
heard
the
clink
of
a
little
bell
and
then
this
exclamation
hello
central
is
this
you
camelotbehold
thou
mayst
glad
thy
heart
an
thou
hast
faith
to
believe
the
wonderful
when
that
it
cometh
in
unexpected
guise
and
maketh
itself
manifest
in
impossible
placeshere
standeth
in
the
flesh
his
mightiness
the
boss
and
with
thine
own
ears
shall
ye
hear
him
speak
now
what
a
radical
reversal
of
things
this
was
what
a
jumbling
together
of
extravagant
incongruities
what
a
fantastic
conjunction
of
opposites
and
irreconcilablesthe
home
of
the
bogus
miracle
become
the
home
of
a
real
one
the
den
of
a
mediaeval
hermit
turned
into
a
telephone
office
the
telephone
clerk
stepped
into
the
light
and
i
recognized
one
of
my
young
fellows
i
said
how
long
has
this
office
been
established
here
ulfius
but
since
midnight
fair
sir
boss
an
it
please
you
we
saw
many
lights
in
the
valley
and
so
judged
it
well
to
make
a
station
for
that
where
so
many
lights
be
needs
must
they
indicate
a
town
of
goodly
size
quite
right
it
isnt
a
town
in
the
customary
sense
but
its
a
good
stand
anyway
do
you
know
where
you
are
of
that
i
have
had
no
time
to
make
inquiry
for
whenas
my
comradeship
moved
hence
upon
their
labors
leaving
me
in
charge
i
got
me
to
needed
rest
purposing
to
inquire
when
i
waked
and
report
the
places
name
to
camelot
for
record
well
this
is
the
valley
of
holiness
it
didnt
take
i
mean
he
didnt
start
at
the
name
as
i
had
supposed
he
would
he
merely
said
i
will
so
report
it
why
the
surrounding
regions
are
filled
with
the
noise
of
late
wonders
that
have
happened
here
you
didnt
hear
of
them
ah
ye
will
remember
we
move
by
night
and
avoid
speech
with
all
we
learn
naught
but
that
we
get
by
the
telephone
from
camelot
why
they
know
all
about
this
thing
havent
they
told
you
anything
about
the
great
miracle
of
the
restoration
of
a
holy
fountain
oh
that
indeed
yes
but
the
name
of
this
valley
doth
woundily
differ
from
the
name
of
that
one
indeed
to
differ
wider
were
not
pos
what
was
that
name
then
the
valley
of
hellishness
that
explains
it
confound
a
telephone
anyway
it
is
the
very
demon
for
conveying
similarities
of
sound
that
are
miracles
of
divergence
from
similarity
of
sense
but
no
matter
you
know
the
name
of
the
place
now
call
up
camelot
he
did
it
and
had
clarence
sent
for
it
was
good
to
hear
my
boys
voice
again
it
was
like
being
home
after
some
affectionate
interchanges
and
some
account
of
my
late
illness
i
said
what
is
new
the
king
and
queen
and
many
of
the
court
do
start
even
in
this
hour
to
go
to
your
valley
to
pay
pious
homage
to
the
waters
ye
have
restored
and
cleanse
themselves
of
sin
and
see
the
place
where
the
infernal
spirit
spouted
true
hellflames
to
the
clouds
an
ye
listen
sharply
ye
may
hear
me
wink
and
hear
me
likewise
smile
a
smile
sith
twas
i
that
made
selection
of
those
flames
from
out
our
stock
and
sent
them
by
your
order
does
the
king
know
the
way
to
this
place
the
kingno
nor
to
any
other
in
his
realms
mayhap
but
the
lads
that
holp
you
with
your
miracle
will
be
his
guide
and
lead
the
way
and
appoint
the
places
for
rests
at
noons
and
sleeps
at
night
this
will
bring
them
herewhen
midafternoon
or
later
the
third
day
anything
else
in
the
way
of
news
the
king
hath
begun
the
raising
of
the
standing
army
ye
suggested
to
him
one
regiment
is
complete
and
officered
the
mischief
i
wanted
a
main
hand
in
that
myself
there
is
only
one
body
of
men
in
the
kingdom
that
are
fitted
to
officer
a
regular
army
yesand
now
ye
will
marvel
to
know
theres
not
so
much
as
one
west
pointer
in
that
regiment
what
are
you
talking
about
are
you
in
earnest
it
is
truly
as
i
have
said
why
this
makes
me
uneasy
who
were
chosen
and
what
was
the
method
competitive
examination
indeed
i
know
naught
of
the
method
i
but
know
thisthese
officers
be
all
of
noble
family
and
are
bornwhat
is
it
you
call
itchuckleheads
theres
something
wrong
clarence
comfort
yourself
then
for
two
candidates
for
a
lieutenancy
do
travel
hence
with
the
kingyoung
nobles
bothand
if
you
but
wait
where
you
are
you
will
hear
them
questioned
that
is
news
to
the
purpose
i
will
get
one
west
pointer
in
anyway
mount
a
man
and
send
him
to
that
school
with
a
message
let
him
kill
horses
if
necessary
but
he
must
be
there
before
sunset
tonight
and
say
there
is
no
need
i
have
laid
a
ground
wire
to
the
school
prithee
let
me
connect
you
with
it
it
sounded
good
in
this
atmosphere
of
telephones
and
lightning
communication
with
distant
regions
i
was
breathing
the
breath
of
life
again
after
long
suffocation
i
realized
then
what
a
creepy
dull
inanimate
horror
this
land
had
been
to
me
all
these
years
and
how
i
had
been
in
such
a
stifled
condition
of
mind
as
to
have
grown
used
to
it
almost
beyond
the
power
to
notice
it
i
gave
my
order
to
the
superintendent
of
the
academy
personally
i
also
asked
him
to
bring
me
some
paper
and
a
fountain
pen
and
a
box
or
so
of
safety
matches
i
was
getting
tired
of
doing
without
these
conveniences
i
could
have
them
now
as
i
wasnt
going
to
wear
armor
any
more
at
present
and
therefore
could
get
at
my
pockets
when
i
got
back
to
the
monastery
i
found
a
thing
of
interest
going
on
the
abbot
and
his
monks
were
assembled
in
the
great
hall
observing
with
childish
wonder
and
faith
the
performances
of
a
new
magician
a
fresh
arrival
his
dress
was
the
extreme
of
the
fantastic
as
showy
and
foolish
as
the
sort
of
thing
an
indian
medicineman
wears
he
was
mowing
and
mumbling
and
gesticulating
and
drawing
mystical
figures
in
the
air
and
on
the
floorthe
regular
thing
you
know
he
was
a
celebrity
from
asiaso
he
said
and
that
was
enough
that
sort
of
evidence
was
as
good
as
gold
and
passed
current
everywhere
how
easy
and
cheap
it
was
to
be
a
great
magician
on
this
fellows
terms
his
specialty
was
to
tell
you
what
any
individual
on
the
face
of
the
globe
was
doing
at
the
moment
and
what
he
had
done
at
any
time
in
the
past
and
what
he
would
do
at
any
time
in
the
future
he
asked
if
any
would
like
to
know
what
the
emperor
of
the
east
was
doing
now
the
sparkling
eyes
and
the
delighted
rubbing
of
hands
made
eloquent
answerthis
reverend
crowd
would
like
to
know
what
that
monarch
was
at
just
as
this
moment
the
fraud
went
through
some
more
mummery
and
then
made
grave
announcement
the
high
and
mighty
emperor
of
the
east
doth
at
this
moment
put
money
in
the
palm
of
a
holy
begging
friarone
two
three
pieces
and
they
be
all
of
silver
a
buzz
of
admiring
exclamations
broke
out
all
around
it
is
marvelous
wonderful
what
study
what
labor
to
have
acquired
a
so
amazing
power
as
this
would
they
like
to
know
what
the
supreme
lord
of
inde
was
doing
yes
he
told
them
what
the
supreme
lord
of
inde
was
doing
then
he
told
them
what
the
sultan
of
egypt
was
at
also
what
the
king
of
the
remote
seas
was
about
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
with
each
new
marvel
the
astonishment
at
his
accuracy
rose
higher
and
higher
they
thought
he
must
surely
strike
an
uncertain
place
some
time
but
no
he
never
had
to
hesitate
he
always
knew
and
always
with
unerring
precision
i
saw
that
if
this
thing
went
on
i
should
lose
my
supremacy
this
fellow
would
capture
my
following
i
should
be
left
out
in
the
cold
i
must
put
a
cog
in
his
wheel
and
do
it
right
away
too
i
said
if
i
might
ask
i
should
very
greatly
like
to
know
what
a
certain
person
is
doing
speak
and
freely
i
will
tell
you
it
will
be
difficultperhaps
impossible
my
art
knoweth
not
that
word
the
more
difficult
it
is
the
more
certainly
will
i
reveal
it
to
you
you
see
i
was
working
up
the
interest
it
was
getting
pretty
high
too
you
could
see
that
by
the
craning
necks
all
around
and
the
halfsuspended
breathing
so
now
i
climaxed
it
if
you
make
no
mistakeif
you
tell
me
truly
what
i
want
to
knowi
will
give
you
two
hundred
silver
pennies
the
fortune
is
mine
i
will
tell
you
what
you
would
know
then
tell
me
what
i
am
doing
with
my
right
hand
ahh
there
was
a
general
gasp
of
surprise
it
had
not
occurred
to
anybody
in
the
crowdthat
simple
trick
of
inquiring
about
somebody
who
wasnt
ten
thousand
miles
away
the
magician
was
hit
hard
it
was
an
emergency
that
had
never
happened
in
his
experience
before
and
it
corked
him
he
didnt
know
how
to
meet
it
he
looked
stunned
confused
he
couldnt
say
a
word
come
i
said
what
are
you
waiting
for
is
it
possible
you
can
answer
up
right
off
and
tell
what
anybody
on
the
other
side
of
the
earth
is
doing

yet
cant

a
person
is
doing
who

will
indorse
you
if
you
tell
correctly
he
was
still
dumb
very
well
ill
tell
you
why
you
dont
speak
up
and
tell
it
is
because
you
dont
know
you
a
magician
good
friends
this
tramp
is
a
mere
fraud
and
liar
this
distressed
the
monks
and
terrified
them
they
were
not
used
to
hearing
these
awful
beings
called
names
and
they
did
not
know
what
might
be
the
consequence
there
was
a
dead
silence
now
superstitious
bodings
were
in
every
mind
the
magician
began
to
pull
his
wits
together
and
when
he
presently
smiled
an
easy
nonchalant
smile
it
spread
a
mighty
relief
around
for
it
indicated
that
his
mood
was
not
destructive
he
said
it
hath
struck
me
speechless
the
frivolity
of
this
persons
speech
let
all
know
if
perchance
there
be
any
who
know
it
not
that
enchanters
of
my
degree
deign
not
to
concern
themselves
with
the
doings
of
any
but
kings
princes
emperors
them
that
be
born
in

and
them
only
had
ye
asked
me
what
arthur
the
great
king
is
doing
it
were
another
matter
and
i
had
told
ye
but
the
doings
of
a
subject
interest
me
not
oh
i
misunderstood
you
i
thought
you
said
anybody
and
so
i
supposed
anybody

anybody
that
is
everybody
it
dothanybody
that
is
of
lofty
birth
and
the
better
if
he
be
royal
that
it
meseemeth
might
well
be
said
the
abbot
who
saw
his
opportunity
to
smooth
things
and
avert
disaster
for
it
were
not
likely
that
so
wonderful
a
gift
as
this
would
be
conferred
for
the
revelation
of
the
concerns
of
lesser
beings
than
such
as
be
born
near
to
the
summits
of
greatness
our
arthur
the
king
would
you
know
of
him
broke
in
the
enchanter
most
gladly
yea
and
gratefully
everybody
was
full
of
awe
and
interest
again
right
away
the
incorrigible
idiots
they
watched
the
incantations
absorbingly
and
looked
at
me
with
a
there
now
what
can
you
say
to
that
air
when
the
announcement
came
the
king
is
weary
with
the
chase
and
lieth
in
his
palace
these
two
hours
sleeping
a
dreamless
sleep
gods
benison
upon
him
said
the
abbot
and
crossed
himself
may
that
sleep
be
to
the
refreshment
of
his
body
and
his
soul
and
so
it
might
be
if
he
were
sleeping
i
said
but
the
king
is
not
sleeping
the
king
rides
here
was
trouble
againa
conflict
of
authority
nobody
knew
which
of
us
to
believe
i
still
had
some
reputation
left
the
magicians
scorn
was
stirred
and
he
said
lo
i
have
seen
many
wonderful
soothsayers
and
prophets
and
magicians
in
my
life
days
but
none
before
that
could
sit
idle
and
see
to
the
heart
of
things
with
never
an
incantation
to
help
you
have
lived
in
the
woods
and
lost
much
by
it
i
use
incantations
myself
as
this
good
brotherhood
are
awarebut
only
on
occasions
of
moment
when
it
comes
to
sarcasming
i
reckon
i
know
how
to
keep
my
end
up
that
jab
made
this
fellow
squirm
the
abbot
inquired
after
the
queen
and
the
court
and
got
this
information
they
be
all
on
sleep
being
overcome
by
fatigue
like
as
to
the
king
i
said
that
is
merely
another
lie
half
of
them
are
about
their
amusements
the
queen
and
the
other
half
are
not
sleeping
they
ride
now
perhaps
you
can
spread
yourself
a
little
and
tell
us
where
the
king
and
queen
and
all
that
are
this
moment
riding
with
them
are
going
they
sleep
now
as
i
said
but
on
the
morrow
they
will
ride
for
they
go
a
journey
toward
the
sea
and
where
will
they
be
the
day
after
tomorrow
at
vespers
far
to
the
north
of
camelot
and
half
their
journey
will
be
done
that
is
another
lie
by
the
space
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
their
journey
will
not
be
merely
half
done
it
will
be
all
done
and
they
will
be
here
in
this
valley
that
was
a
noble
shot
it
set
the
abbot
and
the
monks
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
and
it
rocked
the
enchanter
to
his
base
i
followed
the
thing
right
up
if
the
king
does
not
arrive
i
will
have
myself
ridden
on
a
rail
if
he
does
i
will
ride
you
on
a
rail
instead
next
day
i
went
up
to
the
telephone
office
and
found
that
the
king
had
passed
through
two
towns
that
were
on
the
line
i
spotted
his
progress
on
the
succeeding
day
in
the
same
way
i
kept
these
matters
to
myself
the
third
days
reports
showed
that
if
he
kept
up
his
gait
he
would
arrive
by
four
in
the
afternoon
there
was
still
no
sign
anywhere
of
interest
in
his
coming
there
seemed
to
be
no
preparations
making
to
receive
him
in
state
a
strange
thing
truly
only
one
thing
could
explain
this
that
other
magician
had
been
cutting
under
me
sure
this
was
true
i
asked
a
friend
of
mine
a
monk
about
it
and
he
said
yes
the
magician
had
tried
some
further
enchantments
and
found
out
that
the
court
had
concluded
to
make
no
journey
at
all
but
stay
at
home
think
of
that
observe
how
much
a
reputation
was
worth
in
such
a
country
these
people
had
seen
me
do
the
very
showiest
bit
of
magic
in
history
and
the
only
one
within
their
memory
that
had
a
positive
value
and
yet
here
they
were
ready
to
take
up
with
an
adventurer
who
could
offer
no
evidence
of
his
powers
but
his
mere
unproven
word
however
it
was
not
good
politics
to
let
the
king
come
without
any
fuss
and
feathers
at
all
so
i
went
down
and
drummed
up
a
procession
of
pilgrims
and
smoked
out
a
batch
of
hermits
and
started
them
out
at
two
oclock
to
meet
him
and
that
was
the
sort
of
state
he
arrived
in
the
abbot
was
helpless
with
rage
and
humiliation
when
i
brought
him
out
on
a
balcony
and
showed
him
the
head
of
the
state
marching
in
and
never
a
monk
on
hand
to
offer
him
welcome
and
no
stir
of
life
or
clang
of
joybell
to
glad
his
spirit
he
took
one
look
and
then
flew
to
rouse
out
his
forces
the
next
minute
the
bells
were
dinning
furiously
and
the
various
buildings
were
vomiting
monks
and
nuns
who
went
swarming
in
a
rush
toward
the
coming
procession
and
with
them
went
that
magician
and
he
was
on
a
rail
too
by
the
abbots
order
and
his
reputation
was
in
the
mud
and
mine
was
in
the
sky
again
yes
a
man
can
keep
his
trademark
current
in
such
a
country
but
he
cant
sit
around
and
do
it
he
has
got
to
be
on
deck
and

to
business

a

examination
when
the
king
traveled
for
change

made
a
progress
or
visited
a
distant
noble

cost
of

part
of

the
commission
charged
with
the
examination
of
candidates
for
posts
in
the
army
came
with
the
king
to
the
valley
whereas
they
could
have
transacted
their
business
just
as
well
at
home
and
although
this
expedition
was
strictly
a
holiday
excursion
for
the
king
he
kept
some
of
his
business
functions
going
just
the
same
he
touched
for
the
evil
as
usual
he
held
court
in

gate
at
sunrise
and
tried
cases
for
he
was
himself

he
shone
very
well
in
this
latter
office
he
was
a
wise
and
humane
judge
and
he
clearly
did
his
honest

of

sympathies
were
for
the
former

whether
he
suspected

that
this

effects
of

upon
the

moral
perceptions
are

but
a

of

this
has
a
harsh

should
not

not

to
hear

are

possessors
old
and
inbred
custom
of
regarding
himself
as
a
superior
being
the
kings
judgments
wrought
frequent
injustices
but
it
was
merely
the
fault
of
his
training
his
natural
and
unalterable
sympathies
he
was
as
unfitted
for
a

her

would
fare
a
shade
better
than
the
rest
one
very
curious
case
came
before
the
king
a
young
girl
an
orphan
who
had
a
considerable
estate
married
a
fine
young
fellow
who
had
nothing
the
girls
property
was
within
a
seigniory
held
by
the
church
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
an
arrogant
scion
of
the
great
nobility
claimed
the
girls
estate
on
the
ground
that
she
had
married
privately
and
thus
had
cheated
the
church
out
of
one
of
its
rights
as
lord
of
the
seigniorythe
one
heretofore
referred
to
as
le
droit
du
seigneur
the
penalty
of
refusal
or
avoidance
was
confiscation
the
girls
defense
was
that
the
lordship
of
the
seigniory
was
vested
in
the
bishop
and
the
particular
right
here
involved
was
not
transferable
but
must
be
exercised
by
the
lord
himself
or
stand
vacated
and
that
an
older
law
of
the
church
itself
strictly
barred
the
bishop
from
exercising
it
it
was
a
very
odd
case
indeed
it
reminded
me
of
something
i
had
read
in
my
youth
about
the
ingenious
way
in
which
the
aldermen
of
london
raised
the
money
that
built
the
mansion
house
a
person
who
had
not
taken
the
sacrament
according
to
the
anglican
rite
could
not
stand
as
a
candidate
for
sheriff
of
london
thus
dissenters
were
ineligible
they
could
not
run
if
asked
they
could
not
serve
if
elected
the
aldermen
who
without
any
question
were
yankees
in
disguise
hit
upon
this
neat
device
they
passed
a
bylaw
imposing
a
fine
of
l400
upon
any
one
who
should
refuse
to
be
a
candidate
for
sheriff
and
a
fine
of
l600
upon
any
person
who
after
being
elected
sheriff
refused
to
serve
then
they
went
to
work
and
elected
a
lot
of
dissenters
one
after
another
and
kept
it
up
until
they
had
collected
l15000
in
fines
and
there
stands
the
stately
mansion
house
to
this
day
to
keep
the
blushing
citizen
in
mind
of
a
long
past
and
lamented
day
when
a
band
of
yankees
slipped
into
london
and
played
games
of
the
sort
that
has
given
their
race
a
unique
and
shady
reputation
among
all
truly
good
and
holy
peoples
that
be
in
the
earth
the
girls
case
seemed
strong
to
me
the
bishops
case
was
just
as
strong
i
did
not
see
how
the
king
was
going
to
get
out
of
this
hole
but
he
got
out
i
append
his
decision
truly
i
find
small
difficulty
here
the
matter
being
even
a
childs
affair
for
simpleness
an
the
young
bride
had
conveyed
notice
as
in
duty
bound
to
her
feudal
lord
and
proper
master
and
protector
the
bishop
she
had
suffered
no
loss
for
the
said
bishop
could
have
got
a

a
tragic
end
to
a

honeymoon
not
yet
three
months
old
poor
young
creatures
they
had
lived
these
three
months
lapped
to
the
lips
in
worldly
comforts
these
clothes
and
trinkets
they
were
wearing
were
as
fine
and
dainty
as
the
shrewdest
stretch
of
the
sumptuary
laws
allowed
to
people
of
their
degree
and
in
these
pretty
clothes
she
crying
on
his
shoulder
and
he
trying
to
comfort
her
with
hopeful
words
set
to
the
music
of
despair
they
went
from
the
judgment
seat
out
into
the
world
homeless
bedless
breadless
why
the
very
beggars
by
the
roadsides
were
not
so
poor
as
they
well
the
king
was
out
of
the
hole
and
on
terms
satisfactory
to
the
church
and
the
rest
of
the
aristocracy
no
doubt
men
write
many
fine
and
plausible
arguments
in
support
of
monarchy
but
the
fact
remains
that
where
every
man
in
a
state
has
a
vote
brutal
laws
are
impossible
arthurs
people
were
of
course
poor
material
for
a
republic
because
they
had
been
debased
so
long
by
monarchy
and
yet
even
they
would
have
been
intelligent
enough
to
make
short
work
of
that
law
which
the
king
had
just
been
administering
if
it
had
been
submitted
to
their
full
and
free
vote
there
is
a
phrase
which
has
grown
so
common
in
the
worlds
mouth
that
it
has
come
to
seem
to
have
sense
and
meaningthe
sense
and
meaning
implied
when
it
is
used
that
is
the
phrase
which
refers
to
this
or
that
or
the
other
nation
as
possibly
being
capable
of
selfgovernment
and
the
implied
sense
of
it
is
that
there
has
been
a
nation
somewhere
some
time
or
other
which
wasnt
capable
of
itwasnt
as
able
to
govern
itself
as
some
selfappointed
specialists
were
or
would
be
to
govern
it
the
master
minds
of
all
nations
in
all
ages
have
sprung
in
affluent
multitude
from
the
mass
of
the
nation
and
from
the
mass
of
the
nation
onlynot
from
its
privileged
classes
and
so
no
matter
what
the
nations
intellectual
grade
was
whether
high
or
low
the
bulk
of
its
ability
was
in
the
long
ranks
of
its
nameless
and
its
poor
and
so
it
never
saw
the
day
that
it
had
not
the
material
in
abundance
whereby
to
govern
itself
which
is
to
assert
an
always
selfproven
fact
that
even
the
best
governed
and
most
free
and
most
enlightened
monarchy
is
still
behind
the
best
condition
attainable
by
its
people
and
that
the
same
is
true
of
kindred
governments
of
lower
grades
all
the
way
down
to
the

king
arthur
had
hurried
up
the
army
business
altogether
beyond
my
calculations
i
had
not
supposed
he
would
move
in
the
matter
while
i
was
away
and
so
i
had
not
mapped
out
a
scheme
for
determining
the
merits
of
officers
i
had
only
remarked
that
it
would
be
wise
to
submit
every
candidate
to
a
sharp
and
searching
examination
and
privately
i
meant
to
put
together
a
list
of
military
qualifications
that
nobody
could
answer
to
but
my
west
pointers
that
ought
to
have
been
attended
to
before
i
left
for
the
king
was
so
taken
with
the
idea
of
a
standing
army
that
he
couldnt
wait
but
must
get
about
it
at
once
and
get
up
as
good
a
scheme
of
examination
as
he
could
invent
out
of
his
own
head
i
was
impatient
to
see
what
this
was
and
to
show
too
how
much
more
admirable
was
the
one
which
i
should
display
to
the
examining
board
i
intimated
this
gently
to
the
king
and
it
fired
his
curiosity
when
the
board
was
assembled
i
followed
him
in
and
behind
us
came
the
candidates
one
of
these
candidates
was
a
bright
young
west
pointer
of
mine
and
with
him
were
a
couple
of
my
west
point
professors
when
i
saw
the
board
i
did
not
know
whether
to
cry
or
to
laugh
the
head
of
it
was
the
officer
known
to
later
centuries
as
norroy
kingatarms
the
two
other
members
were
chiefs
of
bureaus
in
his
department
and
all
three
were
priests
of
course
all
officials
who
had
to
know
how
to
read
and
write
were
priests
my
candidate
was
called
first
out
of
courtesy
to
me
and
the
head
of
the
board
opened
on
him
with
official
solemnity

the
king
was
staggered
from
his
summit
to
his
foundations
one
clerk
fainted
and
the
others
came
near
it
the
chairman
pulled
himself
together
and
said
indignantly
it
is
sufficient
get
you
hence
but
i
appealed
to
the
king
i
begged
that
my
candidate
might
be
examined
the
king
was
willing
but
the
board
who
were
all
wellborn
folk
implored
the
king
to
spare
them
the
indignity
of
examining
the
weavers
son
i
knew
they
didnt
know
enough
to
examine
him
anyway
so
i
joined
my
prayers
to
theirs
and
the
king
turned
the
duty
over
to
my
professors
i
had
had
a
blackboard
prepared
and
it
was
put
up
now
and
the
circus
began
it
was
beautiful
to
hear
the
lad
lay
out
the
science
of
war
and
wallow
in
details
of
battle

on

would
stump

you
could
harry

an

with
and
make
him
wish
he
hadnt
comeand
when
the
boy
made
his
military
salute
and
stood
aside
at
last
i
was
proud
enough
to
hug
him
and
all
those
other
people
were
so
dazed
they
looked
partly
petrified
partly
drunk
and
wholly
caught
out
and
snowed
under
i
judged
that
the
cake
was
ours
and
by
a
large
majority
education
is
a
great
thing
this
was
the
same
youth
who
had
come
to
west
point
so
ignorant
that
when
i
asked
him
if
a
general
officer
should
have
a
horse
shot
under
him
on
the
field
of
battle
what
ought
he
to
do
answered
up
naively
and
said
get
up
and
brush
himself
one
of
the
young
nobles
was
called
up
now
i
thought
i
would
question
him
a
little
myself
i
said
can
your
lordship
read
his
face
flushed
indignantly
and
he
fired
this
at
me
takest
me
for
a
clerk
i
trow
i
am
not
of
a
blood
that
answer
the
question
he
crowded
his
wrath
down
and
made
out
to
answer
no
can
you
write
he
wanted
to
resent
this
too
but
i
said
you
will
confine
yourself
to
the
questions
and
make
no
comments
you
are
not
here
to
air
your
blood
or
your
graces
and
nothing
of
the
sort
will
be
permitted
can
you
write
no

you

table

not
what
ye
refer
to
how
much
is
9
times
6
it
is
a
mystery
that
is
hidden
from
me
by
reason
that
the
emergency
requiring
the
fathoming
of
it
hath
not
in
my
lifedays
occurred
and
so
not
having
no
need
to
know
this
thing
i
abide
barren
of
the
knowledge
if
a
trade
a
barrel
of
onions
to
b
worth
2
pence
the
bushel
in
exchange
for
a
sheep
worth
4
pence
and
a
dog
worth
a
penny
and
c
kill
the
dog
before
delivery
because
bitten
by
the
same
who
mistook
him
for
d
what
sum
is
still
due
to
a
from
b
and
which
party
pays
for
the
dog
c
or
d
and
who
gets
the
money
if
a
is
the
penny
sufficient
or
may
he
claim
consequential
damages
in
the
form
of
additional
money
to
represent
the
possible
profit
which
might
have
inured
from
the
dog
and
classifiable
as
earned
increment
that
is
to
say
usufruct
verily
in
the
allwise
and
unknowable
providence
of
god
who
moveth
in
mysterious
ways
his
wonders
to
perform
have
i
never
heard
the
fellow
to
this
question
for
confusion
of
the
mind
and
congestion
of
the
ducts
of
thought
wherefore
i
beseech
you
let
the
dog
and
the
onions
and
these
people
of
the
strange
and
godless
names
work
out
their
several
salvations
from
their
piteous
and
wonderful
difficulties
without
help
of
mine
for
indeed
their
trouble
is
sufficient
as
it
is
whereas
an
i
tried
to
help
i
should
but
damage
their
cause
the
more
and
yet
mayhap
not
live
myself
to
see
the
desolation
wrought
what
do
you
know
of
the
laws
of
attraction
and
gravitation
if
there
be
such
mayhap
his
grace
the
king
did
promulgate
them
whilst
that
i
lay
sick
about
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
thereby
failed
to
hear
his
proclamation
what
do
you
know
of
the
science
of
optics
i
know
of
governors
of
places
and
seneschals
of
castles
and
sheriffs
of
counties
and
many
like
small
offices
and
titles
of
honor
but
him
you
call
the
science
of
optics
i
have
not
heard
of
before
peradventure
it
is
a
new
dignity
yes
in
this
country
try
to
conceive
of
this
mollusk
gravely
applying
for
an
official
position
of
any
kind
under
the
sun
why
he
had
all
the
earmarks
of
a
typewriter
copyist
if
you
leave
out
the
disposition
to
contribute
uninvited
emendations
of
your
grammar
and
punctuation
it
was
unaccountable
that
he
didnt
attempt
a
little
help
of
that
sort
out
of
his
majestic
supply
of
incapacity
for
the
job
but
that
didnt
prove
that
he
hadnt
material
in
him
for
the
disposition
it
only
proved
that
he
wasnt
a
typewriter
copyist
yet
after
nagging
him
a
little
more
i
let
the
professors
loose
on
him
and
they
turned
him
inside
out
on
the
line
of
scientific
war
and
found
him
empty
of
course
he
knew
somewhat
about
the
warfare
of
the
timebushwhacking
around
for
ogres
and
bullfights
in
the
tournament
ring
and
such
thingsbut
otherwise
he
was
empty
and
useless
then
we
took
the
other
young
noble
in
hand
and
he
was
the
first
ones
twin
for
ignorance
and
incapacity
i
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
the
chairman
of
the
board
with
the
comfortable
consciousness
that
their
cake
was
dough

were

the

this
is
an
astonishing
thing
what
good
is
such
a
qualification
as
that
what
good
it
is
a
hardy
question
fair
sir
and
boss
since
it
doth
go
far
to
impugn
the
wisdom
of
even
our
holy
mother
church
herself
as
how
for
that
she
hath
established
the
selfsame
rule
regarding
saints
by
her
law
none
may
be
canonized
until
he
hath
lain
dead
four
generations
i
see
i
seeit
is
the
same
thing
it
is
wonderful
in
the
one
case
a
man
lies
deadalive
four
generationsmummified
in
ignorance
and
slothand
that
qualifies
him
to
command
live
people
and
take
their
weal
and
woe
into
his
impotent
hands
and
in
the
other
case
a
man
lies
bedded
with
death
and
worms
four
generations
and
that
qualifies
him
for
office
in
the
celestial
camp
does
the
kings
grace
approve
of
this
strange
law
the
king
said
why
truly
i
see
naught
about
it
that
is
strange
all
places
of
honor
and
of
profit
do
belong
by
natural
right
to
them
that
be
of
noble
blood
and
so
these
dignities
in
the
army
are
their
property
and
would
be
so
without
this
or
any
rule
the
rule
is
but
to
mark
a
limit
its
purpose
is
to
keep
out
too
recent
blood
which
would
bring
into
contempt
these
offices
and
men
of
lofty
lineage
would
turn
their
backs
and
scorn
to
take
them
i
were
to
blame
an
i
permitted
this
calamity
you
can
permit
it
an
you
are
minded
so
to
do
for
you
have
the
delegated
authority
but
that
the
king
should
do
it
were
a
most
strange
madness
and
not
comprehensible
to
any
i
yield
proceed
sir
chief
of
the
heralds
college
the
chairman
resumed
as
follows
by
what
illustrious
achievement
for
the
honor
of
the
throne
and
state
did
the
founder
of
your
great
line
lift
himself
to
the
sacred
dignity
of
the
british
nobility
he
built
a
brewery
sire
the
board
finds
this
candidate
perfect
in
all
the
requirements
and
qualifications
for
military
command
and
doth
hold
his
case
open
for
decision
after
due
examination
of
his
competitor
the
competitor
came
forward
and
proved
exactly
four
generations
of
nobility
himself
so
there
was
a
tie
in
military
qualifications
that
far
he
stood
aside
a
moment
and
sir
pertipole
was
questioned
further
of
what
condition
was
the
wife
of
the
founder
of
your
line
she
came
of
the
highest
landed
gentry
yet
she
was
not
noble
she
was
gracious
and
pure
and
charitable
of
a
blameless
life
and
character
insomuch
that
in
these
regards
was
she
peer
of
the
best
lady
in
the
land
that
will
do
stand
down
he
called
up
the
competing
lordling
again
and
asked
what
was
the
rank
and
condition
of
the
greatgrandmother
who
conferred
british
nobility
upon
your
great
house
she
was
a
kings
leman
and
did
climb
to
that
splendid
eminence
by
her
own
unholpen
merit
from
the
sewer
where
she
was
born
ah
this
indeed
is
true
nobility
this
is
the
right
and
perfect
intermixture
the
lieutenancy
is
yours
fair
lord
hold
it
not
in
contempt
it
is
the
humble
step
which
will
lead
to
grandeurs
more
worthy
of
the
splendor
of
an
origin
like
to
thine
i
was
down
in
the
bottomless
pit
of
humiliation
i
had
promised
myself
an
easy
and
zenithscouring
triumph
and
this
was
the
outcome
i
was
almost
ashamed
to
look
my
poor
disappointed
cadet
in
the
face
i
told
him
to
go
home
and
be
patient
this
wasnt
the
end
i
had
a
private
audience
with
the
king
and
made
a
proposition
i
said
it
was
quite
right
to
officer
that
regiment
with
nobilities
and
he
couldnt
have
done
a
wiser
thing
it
would
also
be
a
good
idea
to
add
five
hundred
officers
to
it
in
fact
add
as
many
officers
as
there
were
nobles
and
relatives
of
nobles
in
the
country
even
if
there
should
finally
be
five
times
as
many
officers
as
privates
in
it
and
thus
make
it
the
crack
regiment
the
envied
regiment
the
kings
own
regiment
and
entitled
to
fight
on
its
own
hook
and
in
its
own
way
and
go
whither
it
would
and
come
when
it
pleased
in
time
of
war
and
be
utterly
swell
and
independent
this
would
make
that
regiment
the
hearts
desire
of
all
the
nobility
and
they
would
all
be
satisfied
and
happy
then
we
would
make
up
the
rest
of
the
standing
army
out
of
commonplace
materials
and
officer
it
with
nobodies
as
was
propernobodies
selected
on
a
basis
of
mere
efficiencyand
we
would
make
this
regiment
toe
the
line
allow
it
no
aristocratic
freedom
from
restraint
and
force
it
to
do
all
the
work
and
persistent
hammering
to
the
end
that
whenever
the
kings
own
was
tired
and
wanted
to
go
off
for
a
change
and
rummage
around
amongst
ogres
and
have
a
good
time
it
could
go
without
uneasiness
knowing
that
matters
were
in
safe
hands
behind
it
and
business
going
to
be
continued
at
the
old
stand
same
as
usual
the
king
was
charmed
with
the
idea
when
i
noticed
that
it
gave
me
a
valuable
notion
i
thought
i
saw
my
way
out
of
an
old
and
stubborn
difficulty
at
last
you
see
the
royalties
of
the
pendragon
stock
were
a
longlived
race
and
very
fruitful
whenever
a
child
was
born
to
any
of
these
and
it
was
pretty
oftenthere
was
wild
joy
in
the
nations
mouth
and
piteous
sorrow
in
the
nations
heart
the
joy
was
questionable
but
the
grief
was
honest
because
the
event
meant
another
call
for
a
royal
grant
long
was
the
list
of
these
royalties
and
they
were
a
heavy
and
steadily
increasing
burden
upon
the
treasury
and
a
menace
to
the
crown
yet
arthur
could
not
believe
this
latter
fact
and
he
would
not
listen
to
any
of
my
various
projects
for
substituting
something
in
the
place
of
the
royal
grants
if
i
could
have
persuaded
him
to
now
and
then
provide
a
support
for
one
of
these
outlying
scions
from
his
own
pocket
i
could
have
made
a
grand
todo
over
it
and
it
would
have
had
a
good
effect
with
the
nation
but
no
he
wouldnt
hear
of
such
a
thing
he
had
something
like
a
religious
passion
for
royal
grant
he
seemed
to
look
upon
it
as
a
sort
of
sacred
swag
and
one
could
not
irritate
him
in
any
way
so
quickly
and
so
surely
as
by
an
attack
upon
that
venerable
institution
if
i
ventured
to
cautiously
hint
that
there
was
not
another
respectable
family
in
england
that
would
humble
itself
to
hold
out
the
hathowever
that
is
as
far
as
i
ever
got
he
always
cut
me
short
there
and
peremptorily
too
but
i
believed
i
saw
my
chance
at
last
i
would
form
this
crack
regiment
out
of
officers
alonenot
a
single
private
half
of
it
should
consist
of
nobles
who
should
fill
all
the
places
up
to
majorgeneral
and
serve
gratis
and
pay
their
own
expenses
and
they
would
be
glad
to
do
this
when
they
should
learn
that
the
rest
of
the
regiment
would
consist
exclusively
of
princes
of
the
blood
these
princes
of
the
blood
should
range
in
rank
from
lieutenantgeneral
up
to
field
marshal
and
be
gorgeously
salaried
and
equipped
and
fed
by
the
state
moreoverand
this
was
the
master
stroke
it
should
be
decreed
that
these
princely
grandees
should
be
always
addressed
by
a
stunningly
gaudy
and
awecompelling
title
which
i
would
presently
invent
and
they
and
they
only
in
all
england
should
be
so
addressed
finally
all
princes
of
the
blood
should
have
free
choice
join
that
regiment
get
that
great
title
and
renounce
the
royal
grant
or
stay
out
and
receive
a
grant
neatest
touch
of
all
unborn
but
imminent
princes
of
the
blood
could
be
born
into
the
regiment
and
start
fair
with
good
wages
and
a
permanent
situation
upon
due
notice
from
the
parents
all
the
boys
would
join
i
was
sure
of
that
so
all
existing
grants
would
be
relinquished
that
the
newly
born
would
always
join
was
equally
certain
within
sixty
days
that
quaint
and
bizarre
anomaly
the
royal
grant
would
cease
to
be
a
living
fact
and
take
its
place
among
the
curiosities
of
the
past
chapter
xxvi
the
first
newspaper
when
i
told
the
king
i
was
going
out
disguised
as
a
petty
freeman
to
scour
the
country
and
familiarize
myself
with
the
humbler
life
of
the
people
he
was
all
afire
with
the
novelty
of
the
thing
in
a
minute
and
was
bound
to
take
a
chance
in
the
adventure
himselfnothing
should
stop
himhe
would
drop
everything
and
go
alongit
was
the
prettiest
idea
he
had
run
across
for
many
a
day
he
wanted
to
glide
out
the
back
way
and
start
at
once
but
i
showed
him
that
that
wouldnt
answer
you
see
he
was
billed
for
the
kingsevilto
touch
for
it
i
meanand
it
wouldnt
be
right
to
disappoint
the
house
and
it
wouldnt
make
a
delay
worth
considering
anyway
it
was
only
a
onenight
stand
and
i
thought
he
ought
to
tell
the
queen
he
was
going
away
he
clouded
up
at
that
and
looked
sad
i
was
sorry
i
had
spoken
especially
when
he
said
mournfully
thou
forgettest
that
launcelot
is
here
and
where
launcelot
is
she
noteth
not
the
going
forth
of
the
king
nor
what
day
he
returneth
of
course
i
changed
the
subject
yes
guenever
was
beautiful
it
is
true
but
take
her
all
around
she
was
pretty
slack
i
never
meddled
in
these
matters
they
werent
my
affair
but
i
did
hate
to
see
the
way
things
were
going
on
and
i
dont
mind
saying
that
much
manys
the
time
she
had
asked
me
sir
boss
hast
seen
sir
launcelot
about
but
if
ever
she
went
fretting
around
for
the
king
i
didnt
happen
to
be
around
at
the
time
there
was
a
very
good
layout
for
the
kingsevil
businessvery
tidy
and
creditable
the
king
sat
under
a
canopy
of
state
about
him
were
clustered
a
large
body
of
the
clergy
in
full
canonicals
conspicuous
both
for
location
and
personal
outfit
stood
marinel
a
hermit
of
the
quackdoctor
species
to
introduce
the
sick
all
abroad
over
the
spacious
floor
and
clear
down
to
the
doors
in
a
thick
jumble
lay
or
sat
the
scrofulous
under
a
strong
light
it
was
as
good
as
a
tableau
in
fact
it
had
all
the
look
of
being
gotten
up
for
that
though
it
wasnt
there
were
eight
hundred
sick
people
present
the
work
was
slow
it
lacked
the
interest
of
novelty
for
me
because
i
had
seen
the
ceremonies
before
the
thing
soon
became
tedious
but
the
proprieties
required
me
to
stick
it
out
the
doctor
was
there
for
the
reason
that
in
all
such
crowds
there
were
many
people
who
only
imagined
something
was
the
matter
with
them
and
many
who
were
consciously
sound
but
wanted
the
immortal
honor
of
fleshly
contact
with
a
king
and
yet
others
who
pretended
to
illness
in
order
to
get
the
piece
of
coin
that
went
with
the
touch
up
to
this
time
this
coin
had
been
a
wee
little
gold
piece
worth
about
a
third
of
a
dollar
when
you
consider
how
much
that
amount
of
money
would
buy
in
that
age
and
country
and
how
usual
it
was
to
be
scrofulous
when
not
dead
you
would
understand
that
the
annual
kingsevil
appropriation
was
just
the
river
and
harbor
bill
of
that
government
for
the
grip
it
took
on
the
treasury
and
the
chance
it
afforded
for
skinning
the
surplus
so
i
had
privately
concluded
to
touch
the
treasury
itself
for
the
kingsevil
i
covered
sixsevenths
of
the
appropriation
into
the
treasury
a
week
before
starting
from
camelot
on
my
adventures
and
ordered
that
the
other
seventh
be
inflated
into
fivecent
nickels
and
delivered
into
the
hands
of
the
head
clerk
of
the
kings
evil
department
a
nickel
to
take
the
place
of
each
gold
coin
you
see
and
do
its
work
for
it
it
might
strain
the
nickel
some
but
i
judged
it
could
stand
it
as
a
rule
i
do
not
approve
of
watering
stock
but
i
considered
it
square
enough
in
this
case
for
it
was
just
a
gift
anyway
of
course
you
can
water
a
gift
as
much
as
you
want
to
and
i
generally
do
the
old
gold
and
silver
coins
of
the
country
were
of
ancient
and
unknown
origin
as
a
rule
but
some
of
them
were
roman
they
were
illshapen
and
seldom
rounder
than
a
moon
that
is
a
week
past
the
full
they
were
hammered
not
minted
and
they
were
so
worn
with
use
that
the
devices
upon
them
were
as
illegible
as
blisters
and
looked
like
them
i
judged
that
a
sharp
bright
new
nickel
with
a
firstrate
likeness
of
the
king
on
one
side
of
it
and
guenever
on
the
other
and
a
blooming
pious
motto
would
take
the
tuck
out
of
scrofula
as
handy
as
a
nobler
coin
and
please
the
scrofulous
fancy
more
and
i
was
right
this
batch
was
the
first
it
was
tried
on
and
it
worked
to
a
charm
the
saving
in
expense
was
a
notable
economy
you
will
see
that
by
these
figures
we
touched
a
trifle
over
700
of
the
800
patients
at
former
rates
this
would
have
cost
the
government
about
240
at
the
new
rate
we
pulled
through
for
about
35
thus
saving
upward
of
200
at
one
swoop
to
appreciate
the
full
magnitude
of
this
stroke
consider
these
other
figures
the
annual
expenses
of
a
national
government
amount
to
the
equivalent
of
a
contribution
of
three
days
average
wages
of
every
individual
of
the
population
counting
every
individual
as
if
he
were
a
man
if
you
take
a
nation
of
60000000
where
average
wages
are
2
per
day
three
days
wages
taken
from
each
individual
will
provide
360000000
and
pay
the
governments
expenses
in
my
day
in
my
own
country
this
money
was
collected
from
imposts
and
the
citizen
imagined
that
the
foreign
importer
paid
it
and
it
made
him
comfortable
to
think
so
whereas
in
fact
it
was
paid
by
the
american
people
and
was
so
equally
and
exactly
distributed
among
them
that
the
annual
cost
to
the
100millionaire
and
the
annual
cost
to
the
sucking
child
of
the
daylaborer
was
precisely
the
sameeach
paid
6
nothing
could
be
equaler
than
that
i
reckon
well
scotland
and
ireland
were
tributary
to
arthur
and
the
united
populations
of
the
british
islands
amounted
to
something
less
than
1000000
a
mechanics
average
wage
was
3
cents
a
day
when
he
paid
his
own
keep
by
this
rule
the
national
governments
expenses
were
90000
a
year
or
about
250
a
day
thus
by
the
substitution
of
nickels
for
gold
on
a
kingsevil
day
i
not
only
injured
no
one
dissatisfied
no
one
but
pleased
all
concerned
and
saved
fourfifths
of
that
days
national
expense
into
the
bargaina
saving
which
would
have
been
the
equivalent
of
800000
in
my
day
in
america
in
making
this
substitution
i
had
drawn
upon
the
wisdom
of
a
very
remote
sourcethe
wisdom
of
my
boyhoodfor
the
true
statesman
does
not
despise
any
wisdom
howsoever
lowly
may
be
its
origin
in
my
boyhood
i
had
always
saved
my
pennies
and
contributed
buttons
to
the
foreign
missionary
cause
the
buttons
would
answer
the
ignorant
savage
as
well
as
the
coin
the
coin
would
answer
me
better
than
the
buttons
all
hands
were
happy

nobody

marinel
took
the

as

the

he

he

if
he

he

pronounced
the
words
they
shall
lay

then
the

the

would
you
think
that
that

cure
it
certainly
did
any
mummery
will
cure
if
the
patients
faith
is
strong
in
it
up
by
astolat
there
was
a
chapel
where
the
virgin
had
once
appeared
to
a
girl
who
used
to
herd
geese
around
therethe
girl
said
so
herselfand
they
built
the
chapel
upon
that
spot
and
hung
a
picture
in
it
representing
the
occurrencea
picture
which
you
would
think
it
dangerous
for
a
sick
person
to
approach
whereas
on
the
contrary
thousands
of
the
lame
and
the
sick
came
and
prayed
before
it
every
year
and
went
away
whole
and
sound
and
even
the
well
could
look
upon
it
and
live
of
course
when
i
was
told
these
things
i
did
not
believe
them
but
when
i
went
there
and
saw
them
i
had
to
succumb
i
saw
the
cures
effected
myself
and
they
were
real
cures
and
not
questionable
i
saw
cripples
whom
i
had
seen
around
camelot
for
years
on
crutches
arrive
and
pray
before
that
picture
and
put
down
their
crutches
and
walk
off
without
a
limp
there
were
piles
of
crutches
there
which
had
been
left
by
such
people
as
a
testimony
in
other
places
people
operated
on
a
patients
mind
without
saying
a
word
to
him
and
cured
him
in
others
experts
assembled
patients
in
a
room
and
prayed
over
them
and
appealed
to
their
faith
and
those
patients
went
away
cured

you
find

away
in
my

the
monarchs
of
england
had
ceased
to
touch
for
the

but
there
was
no
occasion
for
this
diffidence
they
could
have
cured
it
fortynine
times
in

when
the

had
been
droning
for
three
hours
and
the
good
king
polishing
the
evidences
and
the
sick
were
still
pressing
forward
as
plenty
as
ever
i
got
to
feeling
intolerably
bored
i
was
sitting
by
an
open
window
not
far
from
the
canopy
of
state
for
the
five
hundredth
time
a

stood
forward
to
have
his
repulsivenesses
stroked

again
yet
i
was
conscious
of
a
secret
shock
when
my
eye
fell
upon

in

clammy
atmosphere

once
i
could
have
enjoyed
it
and
seen
nothing

now
its

this

moreover
the

give
offense
to
the

perhaps
lose

indeed
there
was
too
lightsome
a

flippancy
all
through
the

it
was
plain
i
had
undergone
a
considerable
change
without
noticing
it
i
found
myself
unpleasantly

it

the

pleased
me
better
indeed
its
simple

dignified
respectfulness
was
a
distinct
refreshment

me
after
all
those
disgraceful

there
is
no
getting

i
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
profound
monotonousness
about
its

that
baffles

defeats

the

enough
for

want

but
i
got
only
a
few
bites
and
then
had
to
postpone
because
the
monks
around
me
besieged
me
so
with
eager
questions
what
is
this

what

they
suspected
it
was

because
those
among
them
who
knew
how
to
read
latin
and
had
a
smattering
of
greek
recognized
some
of
the

but
they
could
make

put
my

in

i

it

not

i
let
it
go
at
that
then
i
read
in

voice
to
as
many
as
could
crowd
their

heads
within

part
of
the

of

accompanied
by
astonished
and

ejaculations
all
through
ahhh
how
true
amazing
amazing
these
be
the
very
haps
as
they
happened
in
marvelous
exactness
and
might
they
take
this
strange
thing
in
their
hands
and
feel
of
it
and
examine
itthey
would
be
very
careful
yes
so
they
took
it
handling
it
as
cautiously
and
devoutly
as
if
it
had
been
some
holy
thing
come
from
some
supernatural
region
and
gently
felt
of
its
texture
caressed
its
pleasant
smooth
surface
with
lingering
touch
and
scanned
the
mysterious
characters
with
fascinated
eyes
these
grouped
bent
heads
these
charmed
faces
these
speaking
eyes
how
beautiful
to
me
for
was
not
this
my
darling
and
was
not
all
this
mute
wonder
and
interest
and
homage
a
most
eloquent
tribute
and
unforced
compliment
to
it
i
knew
then
how
a
mother
feels
when
women
whether
strangers
or
friends
take
her
new
baby
and
close
themselves
about
it
with
one
eager
impulse
and
bend
their
heads
over
it
in
a
tranced
adoration
that
makes
all
the
rest
of
the
universe
vanish
out
of
their
consciousness
and
be
as
if
it
were
not
for
that
time
i
knew
how
she
feels
and
that
there
is
no
other
satisfied
ambition
whether
of
king
conqueror
or
poet
that
ever
reaches
halfway
to
that
serene
far
summit
or
yields
half
so
divine
a
contentment
during
all
the
rest
of
the
seance
my
paper
traveled
from
group
to
group
all
up
and
down
and
about
that
huge
hall
and
my
happy
eye
was
upon
it
always
and
i
sat
motionless
steeped
in
satisfaction
drunk
with
enjoyment
yes
this
was
heaven
i
was
tasting
it
once
if
i
might
never
taste
it
more

the

and
the
king
travel
incognito
about
bedtime
i
took
the
king
to
my
private
quarters
to
cut
his
hair
and
help
him
get
the
hang
of
the
lowly
raiment
he
was
to
wear
the
high
classes
wore
their
hair
banged
across
the
forehead
but
hanging
to
the
shoulders
the
rest
of
the
way
around
whereas
the
lowest
ranks
of
commoners
were
banged
fore
and
aft
both
the
slaves
were
bangless
and
allowed
their
hair
free
growth
so
i
inverted
a
bowl
over
his
head
and
cut
away
all
the
locks
that
hung
below
it
i
also
trimmed
his
whiskers
and
mustache
until
they
were
only
about
a
halfinch
long
and
tried
to
do
it
inartistically
and
succeeded
it
was
a
villainous
disfigurement
when
he
got
his
lubberly
sandals
on
and
his
long
robe
of
coarse
brown
linen
cloth
which
hung
straight
from
his
neck
to
his
anklebones
he
was
no
longer
the
comeliest
man
in
his
kingdom
but
one
of
the
unhandsomest
and
most
commonplace
and
unattractive
we
were
dressed
and
barbered
alike
and
could
pass
for
small
farmers
or
farm
bailiffs
or
shepherds
or
carters
yes
or
for
village
artisans
if
we
chose
our
costume
being
in
effect
universal
among
the
poor
because
of
its
strength
and
cheapness
i
dont
mean
that
it
was
really
cheap
to
a
very
poor
person
but
i
do
mean
that
it
was
the
cheapest
material
there
was
for
male
attiremanufactured
material
you
understand
we
slipped
away
an
hour
before
dawn
and
by
broad
sunup
had
made
eight
or
ten
miles
and
were
in
the
midst
of
a
sparsely
settled
country
i
had
a
pretty
heavy
knapsack
it
was
laden
with
provisionsprovisions
for
the
king
to
taper
down
on
till
he
could
take
to
the
coarse
fare
of
the
country
without
damage
i
found
a
comfortable
seat
for
the
king
by
the
roadside
and
then
gave
him
a
morsel
or
two
to
stay
his
stomach
with
then
i
said
i
would
find
some
water
for
him
and
strolled
away
part
of
my
project
was
to
get
out
of
sight
and
sit
down
and
rest
a
little
myself
it
had
always
been
my
custom
to
stand
when
in
his
presence
even
at
the
council
board
except
upon
those
rare
occasions
when
the
sitting
was
a
very
long
one
extending
over
hours
then
i
had
a
trifling
little
backless
thing
which
was
like
a
reversed
culvert
and
was
as
comfortable
as
the
toothache
i
didnt
want
to
break
him
in
suddenly
but
do
it
by
degrees
we
should
have
to
sit
together
now
when
in
company
or
people
would
notice
but
it
would
not
be
good
politics
for
me
to
be
playing
equality
with
him
when
there
was
no
necessity
for
it
i
found
the
water
some
three
hundred
yards
away
and
had
been
resting
about
twenty
minutes
when
i
heard
voices
that
is
all
right
i
thoughtpeasants
going
to
work
nobody
else
likely
to
be
stirring
this
early
but
the
next
moment
these
comers
jingled
into
sight
around
a
turn
of
the
roadsmartly
clad
people
of
quality
with
luggagemules
and
servants
in
their
train
i
was
off
like
a
shot
through
the
bushes
by
the
shortest
cut
for
a
while
it
did
seem
that
these
people
would
pass
the
king
before
i
could
get
to
him
but
desperation
gives
you
wings
you
know
and
i
canted
my
body
forward
inflated
my
breast
and
held
my
breath
and
flew
i
arrived
and
in
plenty
good
enough
time
too
pardon
my
king
but
its
no
time
for
ceremonyjump
jump
to
your
feetsome
quality
are
coming
is
that
a
marvel
let
them
come
but
my
liege
you
must
not
be
seen
sitting
riseand
stand
in
humble
posture
while
they
pass
you
are
a
peasant
you
know
truei
had
forgot
it
so
lost
was
i
in
planning
of
a
huge
war
with
gaulhe
was
up
by
this
time
but
a
farm
could
have
got
up
quicker
if
there
was
any
kind
of
a
boom
in
real
estateand
rightso
a
thought
came
randoming
overthwart
this
majestic
dream
the
which
a
humbler
attitude
my
lord
the
kingand
quick
duck
your
head
morestill
moredroop
it
he
did
his
honest
best
but
lord
it
was
no
great
things
he
looked
as
humble
as
the
leaning
tower
at
pisa
it
is
the
most
you
could
say
of
it
indeed
it
was
such
a
thundering
poor
success
that
it
raised
wondering
scowls
all
along
the
line
and
a
gorgeous
flunkey
at
the
tail
end
of
it
raised
his
whip
but
i
jumped
in
time
and
was
under
it
when
it
fell
and
under
cover
of
the
volley
of
coarse
laughter
which
followed
i
spoke
up
sharply
and
warned
the
king
to
take
no
notice
he
mastered
himself
for
the
moment
but
it
was
a
sore
tax
he
wanted
to
eat
up
the
procession
i
said
it
would
end
our
adventures
at
the
very
start
and
we
being
without
weapons
could
do
nothing
with
that
armed
gang
if
we
are
going
to
succeed
in
our
emprise
we
must
not
only
look
the
peasant
but
act
the
peasant
it
is
wisdom
none
can
gainsay
it
let
us
go
on
sir
boss
i
will
take
note
and
learn
and
do
the
best
i
may
he
kept
his
word
he
did
the
best
he
could
but
ive
seen
better
if
you
have
ever
seen
an
active
heedless
enterprising
child
going
diligently
out
of
one
mischief
and
into
another
all
day
long
and
an
anxious
mother
at
its
heels
all
the
while
and
just
saving
it
by
a
hair
from
drowning
itself
or
breaking
its
neck
with
each
new
experiment
youve
seen
the
king
and
me
if
i
could
have
foreseen
what
the
thing
was
going
to
be
like
i
should
have
said
no
if
anybody
wants
to
make
his
living
exhibiting
a
king
as
a
peasant
let
him
take
the
layout
i
can
do
better
with
a
menagerie
and
last
longer
and
yet
during
the
first
three
days
i
never
allowed
him
to
enter
a
hut
or
other
dwelling
if
he
could
pass
muster
anywhere
during
his
early
novitiate
it
would
be
in
small
inns
and
on
the
road
so
to
these
places
we
confined
ourselves
yes
he
certainly
did
the
best
he
could
but
what
of
that
he
didnt
improve
a
bit
that
i
could
see
he
was
always
frightening
me
always
breaking
out
with
fresh
astonishers
in
new
and
unexpected
places
toward
evening
on
the
second
day
what
does
he
do
but
blandly
fetch
out
a
dirk
from
inside
his
robe
great
guns
my
liege
where
did
you
get
that
from
a
smuggler
at
the
inn
yester
eve
what
in
the
world
possessed
you
to
buy
it
we
have
escaped
divers
dangers
by
witthy
witbut
i
have
bethought
me
that
it
were
but
prudence
if
i
bore
a
weapon
too
thine
might
fail
thee
in
some
pinch
but
people
of
our
condition
are
not
allowed
to
carry
arms
what
would
a
lord
sayyes
or
any
other
person
of
whatever
condition
if
he
caught
an
upstart
peasant
with
a
dagger
on
his
person
it
was
a
lucky
thing
for
us
that
nobody
came
along
just
then
i
persuaded
him
to
throw
the
dirk
away
and
it
was
as
easy
as
persuading
a
child
to
give
up
some
bright
fresh
new
way
of
killing
itself
we
walked
along
silent
and
thinking
finally
the
king
said
when
ye
know
that
i
meditate
a
thing
inconvenient
or
that
hath
a
peril
in
it
why
do
you
not
warn
me
to
cease
from
that
project
it
was
a
startling
question
and
a
puzzler
i
didnt
quite
know
how
to
take
hold
of
it
or
what
to
say
and
so
of
course
i
ended
by
saying
the
natural
thing
but
sire
how
can
i
know
what
your
thoughts
are
the
king
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
and
stared
at
me
i
believed
thou
wert
greater
than
merlin
and
truly
in
magic
thou
art
but
prophecy
is
greater
than
magic
merlin
is
a
prophet
i
saw
i
had
made
a
blunder
i
must
get
back
my
lost
ground
after
a
deep
reflection
and
careful
planning
i
said
sire
i
have
been
misunderstood
i
will
explain
there
are
two
kinds
of
prophecy
one
is
the
gift
to
foretell
things
that
are
but
a
little
way
off
the
other
is
the
gift
to
foretell
things
that
are
whole
ages
and
centuries
away
which
is
the
mightier
gift
do
you
think
oh
the
last
most
surely
true
does
merlin
possess
it
partly
yes
he
foretold
mysteries
about
my
birth
and
future
kingship
that
were
twenty
years
away
has
he
ever
gone
beyond
that
he
would
not
claim
more
i
think
it
is
probably
his
limit
all
prophets
have
their
limit
the
limit
of
some
of
the
great
prophets
has
been
a
hundred
years
these
are
few
i
ween
there
have
been
two
still
greater
ones
whose
limit
was
four
hundred
and
six
hundred
years
and
one
whose
limit
compassed
even
seven
hundred
and
twenty
gramercy
it
is
marvelous
but
what
are
these
in
comparison
with
me
they
are
nothing
what
canst
thou
truly
look
beyond
even
so
vast
a
stretch
of
time
as
seven
hundred
years
my
liege
as
clear
as
the
vision
of
an
eagle
does
my
prophetic
eye
penetrate
and
lay
bare
the
future
of
this
world
for
nearly
thirteen
centuries
and
a
half
my
land
you
should
have
seen
the
kings
eyes
spread
slowly
open
and
lift
the
earths
entire
atmosphere
as
much
as
an
inch
that
settled
brer
merlin
one
never
had
any
occasion
to
prove
his
facts
with
these
people
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
state
them
it
never
occurred
to
anybody
to
doubt
the
statement
now
then
i
continued
i
could
work
both
kinds
of
prophecy
the
long
and
the
shortif
i
chose
to
take
the
trouble
to
keep
in
practice
but
i
seldom
exercise
any
but
the
long
kind
because
the
other
is
beneath
my
dignity
it
is
properer
to
merlins
sort
stumptail
prophets
as
we
call
them
in
the
profession
of
course
i
whet
up
now
and
then
and
flirt
out
a
minor
prophecy
but
not
oftenhardly
ever
in
fact
you
will
remember
that
there
was
great
talk
when
you
reached
the
valley
of
holiness
about
my
having
prophesied
your
coming
and
the
very
hour
of
your
arrival
two
or
three
days
beforehand
indeed
yes
i
mind
it
now
well
i
could
have
done
it
as
much
as
forty
times
easier
and
piled
on
a
thousand
times
more
detail
into
the
bargain
if
it
had
been
five
hundred
years
away
instead
of
two
or
three
days
how
amazing
that
it
should
be
so
yes
a
genuine
expert
can
always
foretell
a
thing
that
is
five
hundred
years
away
easier
than
he
can
a
thing
thats
only
five
hundred
seconds
off
and
yet
in
reason
it
should
clearly
be
the
other
way
it
should
be
five
hundred
times
as
easy
to
foretell
the
last
as
the
first
for
indeed
it
is
so
close
by
that
one
uninspired
might
almost
see
it
in
truth
the
law
of
prophecy
doth
contradict
the
likelihoods
most
strangely
making
the
difficult
easy
and
the
easy
difficult
it
was
a
wise
head
a
peasants
cap
was
no
safe
disguise
for
it
you
could
know
it
for
a
kings
under
a
divingbell
if
you
could
hear
it
work
its
intellect
i
had
a
new
trade
now
and
plenty
of
business
in
it
the
king
was
as
hungry
to
find
out
everything
that
was
going
to
happen
during
the
next
thirteen
centuries
as
if
he
were
expecting
to
live
in
them
from
that
time
out
i
prophesied
myself
baldheaded
trying
to
supply
the
demand
i
have
done
some
indiscreet
things
in
my
day
but
this
thing
of
playing
myself
for
a
prophet
was
the
worst
still
it
had
its
ameliorations
a
prophet
doesnt
have
to
have
any
brains
they
are
good
to
have
of
course
for
the
ordinary
exigencies
of
life
but
they
are
no
use
in
professional
work
it
is
the
restfulest
vocation
there
is
when
the
spirit
of
prophecy
comes
upon
you
you
merely
take
your
intellect
and
lay
it
off
in
a
cool
place
for
a
rest
and
unship
your
jaw
and
leave
it
alone
it
will
work
itself
the
result
is
prophecy
every
day
a
knighterrant
or
so
came
along
and
the
sight
of
them
fired
the
kings
martial
spirit
every
time
he
would
have
forgotten
himself
sure
and
said
something
to
them
in
a
style
a
suspicious
shade
or
so
above
his
ostensible
degree
and
so
i
always
got
him
well
out
of
the
road
in
time
then
he
would
stand
and
look
with
all
his
eyes
and
a
proud
light
would
flash
from
them
and
his
nostrils
would
inflate
like
a
warhorses
and
i
knew
he
was
longing
for
a
brush
with
them
but
about
noon
of
the
third
day
i
had
stopped
in
the
road
to
take
a
precaution
which
had
been
suggested
by
the
whipstroke
that
had
fallen
to
my
share
two
days
before
a
precaution
which
i
had
afterward
decided
to
leave
untaken
i
was
so
loath
to
institute
it
but
now
i
had
just
had
a
fresh
reminder
while
striding
heedlessly
along
with
jaw
spread
and
intellect
at
rest
for
i
was
prophesying
i
stubbed
my
toe
and
fell
sprawling
i
was
so
pale
i
couldnt
think
for
a
moment
then
i
got
softly
and
carefully
up
and
unstrapped
my
knapsack
i
had
that
dynamite
bomb
in
it
done
up
in
wool
in
a
box
it
was
a
good
thing
to
have
along
the
time
would
come
when
i
could
do
a
valuable
miracle
with
it
maybe
but
it
was
a
nervous
thing
to
have
about
me
and
i
didnt
like
to
ask
the
king
to
carry
it
yet
i
must
either
throw
it
away
or
think
up
some
safe
way
to
get
along
with
its
society
i
got
it
out
and
slipped
it
into
my
scrip
and
just
then
here
came
a
couple
of
knights
the
king
stood
stately
as
a
statue
gazing
toward
themhad
forgotten
himself
again
of
courseand
before
i
could
get
a
word
of
warning
out
it
was
time
for
him
to
skip
and
well
that
he
did
it
too
he
supposed
they
would
turn
aside
turn
aside
to
avoid
trampling
peasant
dirt
under
foot
when
had
he
ever
turned
aside
himselfor
ever
had
the
chance
to
do
it
if
a
peasant
saw
him
or
any
other
noble
knight
in
time
to
judiciously
save
him
the
trouble
the
knights
paid
no
attention
to
the
king
at
all
it
was
his
place
to
look
out
himself
and
if
he
hadnt
skipped
he
would
have
been
placidly
ridden
down
and
laughed
at
besides
the
king
was
in
a
flaming
fury
and
launched
out
his
challenge
and
epithets
with
a
most
royal
vigor
the
knights
were
some
little
distance
by
now
they
halted
greatly
surprised
and
turned
in
their
saddles
and
looked
back
as
if
wondering
if
it
might
be
worth
while
to
bother
with
such
scum
as
we
then
they
wheeled
and
started
for
us
not
a
moment
must
be
lost
i
started
for
them
i
passed
them
at
a
rattling
gait
and
as
i
went
by
i
flung
out
a
hairlifting
soulscorching
thirteenjointed
insult
which
made
the
kings
effort
poor
and
cheap
by
comparison
i
got
it
out
of
the
nineteenth
century
where
they
know
how
they
had
such
headway
that
they
were
nearly
to
the
king
before
they
could
check
up
then
frantic
with
rage
they
stood
up
their
horses
on
their
hind
hoofs
and
whirled
them
around
and
the
next
moment
here
they
came
breast
to
breast
i
was
seventy
yards
off
then
and
scrambling
up
a
great
bowlder
at
the
roadside
when
they
were
within
thirty
yards
of
me
they
let
their
long
lances
droop
to
a
level
depressed
their
mailed
heads
and
so
with
their
horsehair
plumes
streaming
straight
out
behind
most
gallant
to
see
this
lightning
express
came
tearing
for
me
when
they
were
within
fifteen
yards
i
sent
that
bomb
with
a
sure
aim
and
it
struck
the
ground
just
under
the
horses
noses
yes
it
was
a
neat
thing
very
neat
and
pretty
to
see
it
resembled
a
steamboat
explosion
on
the
mississippi
and
during
the
next
fifteen
minutes
we
stood
under
a
steady
drizzle
of
microscopic
fragments
of
knights
and
hardware
and
horseflesh
i
say
we
for
the
king
joined
the
audience
of
course
as
soon
as
he
had
got
his
breath
again
there
was
a
hole
there
which
would
afford
steady
work
for
all
the
people
in
that
region
for
some
years
to
come
in
trying
to
explain
it
i
mean
as
for
filling
it
up
that
service
would
be
comparatively
prompt
and
would
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
select
fewpeasants
of
that
seignory
and
they
wouldnt
get
anything
for
it
either
but
i
explained
it
to
the
king
myself
i
said
it
was
done
with
a
dynamite
bomb
this
information
did
him
no
damage
because
it
left
him
as
intelligent
as
he
was
before
however
it
was
a
noble
miracle
in
his
eyes
and
was
another
settler
for
merlin
i
thought
it
well
enough
to
explain
that
this
was
a
miracle
of
so
rare
a
sort
that
it
couldnt
be
done
except
when
the
atmospheric
conditions
were
just
right
otherwise
he
would
be
encoring
it
every
time
we
had
a
good
subject
and
that
would
be
inconvenient
because
i
hadnt
any
more
bombs
along
chapter
xxviii
drilling
the
king
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
when
it
was
just
sunrise
and
we
had
been
tramping
an
hour
in
the
chill
dawn
i
came
to
a
resolution
the
king
must
be
drilled
things
could
not
go
on
so
he
must
be
taken
in
hand
and
deliberately
and
conscientiously
drilled
or
we
couldnt
ever
venture
to
enter
a
dwelling
the
very
cats
would
know
this
masquerader
for
a
humbug
and
no
peasant
so
i
called
a
halt
and
said
sire
as
between
clothes
and
countenance
you
are
all
right
there
is
no
discrepancy
but
as
between
your
clothes
and
your
bearing
you
are
all
wrong
there
is
a
most
noticeable
discrepancy
your
soldierly
stride
your
lordly
portthese
will
not
do
you
stand
too
straight
your
looks
are
too
high
too
confident
the
cares
of
a
kingdom
do
not
stoop
the
shoulders
they
do
not
droop
the
chin
they
do
not
depress
the
high
level
of
the
eyeglance
they
do
not
put
doubt
and
fear
in
the
heart
and
hang
out
the
signs
of
them
in
slouching
body
and
unsure
step
it
is
the
sordid
cares
of
the
lowly
born
that
do
these
things
you
must
learn
the
trick
you
must
imitate
the
trademarks
of
poverty
misery
oppression
insult
and
the
other
several
and
common
inhumanities
that
sap
the
manliness
out
of
a
man
and
make
him
a
loyal
and
proper
and
approved
subject
and
a
satisfaction
to
his
masters
or
the
very
infants
will
know
you
for
better
than
your
disguise
and
we
shall
go
to
pieces
at
the
first
hut
we
stop
at
pray
try
to
walk
like
this
the
king
took
careful
note
and
then
tried
an
imitation

it
is

all
right
almost
to

everything
about

that

what
then
must

do
to

let
me
think
i
cant
seem
to
quite
get
at
it
in
fact
there
isnt
anything
that
can
right
the
matter
but
practice
this
is
a
good
place
for
it
roots
and
stony
ground
to
break
up
your
stately
gait
a
region
not
liable
to
interruption
only
one
field
and
one
hut
in
sight
and
they
so
far
away
that
nobody
could
see
us
from
there
it
will
be
well
to
move
a
little
off
the
road
and
put
in
the
whole
day
drilling
you
sire
after
the
drill
had
gone
on
a
little
while
i
said
now
sire
imagine
that
we
are
at
the
door
of
the
hut
yonder
and
the
family
are
before
us
proceed
pleaseaccost

head
of
the
house
the
king
unconsciously
straightened
up
like
a
monument
and
said
with
frozen
austerity
varlet
bring
a
seat
and
serve
to
me
what
cheer
ye
have
ah
your
grace
that
is
not
well
done
in
what
lacketh
it
these
people
do
not
call
each
other
varlets
nay
is
that
true
yes
only
those
above
them
call
them
so
then
must
i
try
again
i
will
call
him
villein
nono
for
he
may
be
a
freeman
ahso
then
peradventure
i
should
call
him
goodman
that
would
answer
your
grace
but
it
would
be
still
better
if
you
said
friend
or
brother
brotherto
dirt
like
that
ah
but
we
are
pretending
to
be
dirt
like
that
too
it
is
even
true
i
will
say
it
brother
bring
a
seat
and
thereto
what
cheer
ye
have
withal
now
tis
right
not
quite
not
wholly
right
you
have
asked
for
one
not
us
for
one
not
both
food
for
one
a
seat
for
one
the
king
looked
puzzledhe
wasnt
a
very
heavy
weight
intellectually
his
head
was
an
hourglass
it
could
stow
an
idea
but
it
had
to
do
it
a
grain
at
a
time
not
the
whole
idea
at
once
would
you
have
a
seat
alsoand
sit
if
i
did
not
sit
the
man
would
perceive
that
we
were
only
pretending
to
be
equalsand
playing
the
deception
pretty
poorly
too
it
is
well
and
truly
said
how
wonderful
is
truth
come
it
in
whatsoever
unexpected
form
it
may
yes
he
must
bring
out
seats
and
food
for
both
and
in
serving
us
present
not
ewer
and
napkin
with
more
show
of
respect
to
the
one
than
to
the
other
and
there
is
even
yet
a
detail
that
needs
correcting
he
must
bring
nothing
outside
we
will
go
inin
among
the
dirt
and
possibly
other
repulsive
thingsand
take
the
food
with
the
household
and
after
the
fashion
of
the
house
and
all
on
equal
terms
except
the
man
be
of
the
serf
class
and
finally
there
will
be
no
ewer
and
no
napkin
whether
he
be
serf
or
free
please
walk
again
my
liege
thereit
is
betterit
is
the
best
yet
but
not
perfect
the
shoulders
have
known
no
ignobler
burden
than
iron
mail
and
they
will
not
stoop
give
me
then
the
bag
i
will
learn
the
spirit
that
goeth
with
burdens
that
have
not
honor
it
is
the
spirit
that
stoopeth
the
shoulders
i
ween
and
not
the
weight
for
armor
is
heavy
yet
it
is
a
proud
burden
and
a
man
standeth
straight
in
it
nay
but
me
no
buts
offer
me
no
objections
i
will
have
the
thing
strap
it
upon
my
back
he
was
complete
now
with
that
knapsack
on
and
looked
as
little
like
a
king
as
any
man
i
had
ever
seen
but
it
was
an
obstinate
pair
of
shoulders
they
could
not
seem
to
learn
the
trick
of
stooping
with
any
sort
of
deceptive
naturalness
the
drill
went
on
i
prompting
and
correcting
now
make
believe
you
are
in
debt
and
eaten
up
by
relentless
creditors
you
are
out
of
workwhich
is
horseshoeing
let
us
sayand
can
get
none
and
your
wife
is
sick
your
children
are
crying
because
they
are
hungry
and
so
on
and
so
on
i
drilled
him
as
representing
in
turn
all
sorts
of
people
out
of
luck
and
suffering
dire
privations
and
misfortunes
but
lord
it
was
only
just
words
wordsthey
meant
nothing
in
the
world
to
him
i
might
just
as
well
have
whistled
words
realize
nothing
vivify
nothing
to
you
unless
you
have
suffered
in
your
own
person
the
thing
which
the
words
try
to
describe
there
are
wise
people
who
talk
ever
so
knowingly
and
complacently
about
the
working
classes
and
satisfy
themselves
that
a
days
hard
intellectual
work
is
very
much
harder
than
a
days
hard
manual
toil
and
is
righteously
entitled
to
much
bigger
pay
why
they
really
think
that
you
know
because
they
know
all
about
the
one
but
havent
tried
the
other
but
i
know
all
about
both
and
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
there
isnt
money
enough
in
the
universe
to
hire
me
to
swing
a
pickaxe
thirty
days
but
i
will
do
the
hardest
kind
of
intellectual
work
for
just
as
near
nothing
as
you
can
cipher
it
downand
i
will
be
satisfied
too
intellectual
work
is
misnamed
it
is
a
pleasure
a
dissipation

is
its

its
a

xxix
the
smallpox
hut
when
we
arrived
at
that
hut
at
midafternoon
we
saw
no
signs
of
life
about
it
the
field
near
by
had
been
denuded
of
its
crop
some
time
before
and
had
a
skinned
look
so
exhaustively
had
it
been
harvested
and
gleaned
fences
sheds
everything
had
a
ruined
look
and
were
eloquent
of
poverty
no
animal
was
around
anywhere
no
living
thing
in
sight
the
stillness
was
awful
it
was
like
the
stillness
of
death
the
cabin
was
a
onestory
one
whose
thatch
was
black
with
age
and
ragged
from
lack
of
repair
the
door
stood
a
trifle
ajar
we
approached
it
stealthilyon
tiptoe
and
at
halfbreathfor
that
is
the
way
ones
feeling
makes
him
do
at
such
a
time
the
king
knocked
we
waited
no
answer
knocked
again
no
answer
i
pushed
the
door
softly
open
and
looked
in
i
made
out
some
dim
forms
and
a
woman
started
up
from
the
ground
and
stared
at
me
as
one
does
who
is
wakened
from
sleep
presently
she
found
her
voice
have
mercy
she
pleaded
all
is
taken
nothing
is
left
i
have
not
come
to
take
anything
poor
woman
you
are
not
a
priest
no
nor
come
not
from
the
lord
of
the
manor
no
i
am
a
stranger
oh
then
for
the
fear
of
god
who
visits
with
misery
and
death
such
as
be
harmless
tarry
not
here
but
fly
this
place
is
under
his
curseand
his
churchs
let
me
come
in
and
help
youyou
are
sick
and
in
trouble
i
was
better
used
to
the
dim
light
now
i
could
see
her
hollow
eyes
fixed
upon
me
i
could
see
how
emaciated
she
was
i
tell
you
the
place
is
under
the
churchs
ban
save
yourself
and
go
before
some
straggler
see
thee
here
and
report
it
give
yourself
no
trouble
about
me
i
dont
care
anything
for
the
churchs
curse
let
me
help
you
now
all
good
spiritsif
there
be
any
suchbless
thee
for
that
word
would
god
i
had
a
sup
of
waterbut
hold
hold
forget
i
said
it
and
fly
for
there
is
that
here
that
even
he
that
feareth
not
the
church
must
fear
this
disease
whereof
we
die
leave
us
thou
brave
good
stranger
and
take
with
thee
such
whole
and
sincere
blessing
as
them
that
be
accursed
can
give
but
before
this
i
had
picked
up
a
wooden
bowl
and
was
rushing
past
the
king
on
my
way
to
the
brook
it
was
ten
yards
away
when
i
got
back
and
entered
the
king
was
within
and
was
opening
the
shutter
that
closed
the
windowhole
to
let
in
air
and
light
the
place
was
full
of
a
foul
stench
i
put
the
bowl
to
the
womans
lips
and
as
she
gripped
it
with
her
eager
talons
the
shutter
came
open
and
a
strong
light
flooded
her
face
smallpox
i
sprang
to
the
king
and
said
in
his
ear
out
of
the
door
on
the
instant
sire
the
woman
is
dying
of
that
disease
that
wasted
the
skirts
of
camelot
two
years
ago
he
did
not
budge
of
a
truth
i
shall
remainand
likewise
help
i
whispered
again
king
it
must
not
be
you
must
go
ye
mean
well
and
ye
speak
not
unwisely
but
it
were
shame
that
a
king
should
know
fear
and
shame
that
belted
knight
should
withhold
his
hand
where
be
such
as
need
succor
peace
i
will
not
go
it
is
you
who
must
go
the
churchs
ban
is
not
upon
me
but
it
forbiddeth
you
to
be
here
and
she
will
deal
with
you
with
a
heavy
hand
an
word
come
to
her
of
your
trespass
it
was
a
desperate
place
for
him
to
be
in
and
might
cost
him
his
life
but
it
was
no
use
to
argue
with
him
if
he
considered
his
knightly
honor
at
stake
here
that
was
the
end
of
argument
he
would
stay
and
nothing
could
prevent
it
i
was
aware
of
that
and
so
i
dropped
the
subject
the
woman
spoke
fair
sir
of
your
kindness
will
ye
climb
the
ladder
there
and
bring
me
news
of
what
ye
find
be
not
afraid
to
report
for
times
can
come
when
even
a
mothers
heart
is
past
breaking
being
already
broke
abide
said
the
king
and
give
the
woman
to
eat
i
will
go
and
he
put
down
the
knapsack
i
turned
to
start
but
the
king
had
already
started
he
halted
and
looked
down
upon
a
man
who
lay
in
a
dim
light
and
had
not
noticed
us
thus
far
or
spoken
is
it
your
husband
the
king
asked
yes
is
he
asleep
god
be
thanked
for
that
one
charity
yesthese
three
hours
where
shall
i
pay
to
the
full
my
gratitude
for
my
heart
is
bursting
with
it
for
that
sleep
he
sleepeth
now
i
said
we
will
be
careful
we
will
not
wake
him
ah
no
that
ye
will
not
for
he
is
dead
dead
yes
what
triumph
it
is
to
know
it
none
can
harm
him
none
insult
him
more
he
is
in
heaven
now
and
happy
or
if
not
there
he
bides
in
hell
and
is
content
for
in
that
place
he
will
find
neither
abbot
nor
yet
bishop
we
were
boy
and
girl
together
we
were
man
and
wife
these
five
and
twenty
years
and
never
separated
till
this
day
think
how
long
that
is
to
love
and
suffer
together
this
morning
was
he
out
of
his
mind
and
in
his
fancy
we
were
boy
and
girl
again
and
wandering
in
the
happy
fields
and
so
in
that
innocent
glad
converse
wandered
he
far
and
farther
still
lightly
gossiping
and
entered
into
those
other
fields
we
know
not
of
and
was
shut
away
from
mortal
sight
and
so
there
was
no
parting
for
in
his
fancy
i
went
with
him
he
knew
not
but
i
went
with
him
my
hand
in
hismy
young
soft
hand
not
this
withered
claw
ah
yes
to
go
and
know
it
not
to
separate
and
know
it
not
how
could
one
go
peacefuller
than
that
it
was
his
reward
for
a
cruel
life
patiently
borne
there
was
a
slight
noise
from
the
direction
of
the
dim
corner
where
the
ladder
was
it
was
the
king
descending
i
could
see
that
he
was
bearing
something
in
one
arm
and
assisting
himself
with
the
other
he
came
forward
into
the
light
upon
his
breast
lay
a
slender
girl
of
fifteen
she
was
but
half
conscious
she
was
dying
of
smallpox
here
was
heroism
at
its
last
and
loftiest
possibility
its
utmost
summit
this
was
challenging
death
in
the
open
field
unarmed
with
all
the
odds
against
the
challenger
no
reward
set
upon
the
contest
and
no
admiring
world
in
silks
and
cloth
of
gold
to
gaze
and
applaud
and
yet
the
kings
bearing
was
as
serenely
brave
as
it
had
always
been
in
those
cheaper
contests
where
knight
meets
knight
in
equal
fight
and
clothed
in
protecting
steel
he
was
great
now
sublimely
great
the
rude
statues
of
his
ancestors
in
his
palace
should
have
an
additioni
would
see
to
that
and
it
would
not
be
a
mailed
king
killing
a
giant
or
a
dragon
like
the
rest
it
would
be
a
king
in
commoners
garb
bearing
death
in
his
arms
that
a
peasant
mother
might
look
her
last
upon
her
child
and
be
comforted
he
laid
the
girl
down
by
her
mother
who
poured
out
endearments
and
caresses
from
an
overflowing
heart
and
one
could
detect
a
flickering
faint
light
of
response
in
the
childs
eyes
but
that
was
all
the
mother
hung
over
her
kissing
her
petting
her
and
imploring
her
to
speak
but
the
lips
only
moved
and
no
sound
came
i
snatched
my
liquor
flask
from
my
knapsack
but
the
woman
forbade
me
and
said
noshe
does
not
suffer
it
is
better
so
it
might
bring
her
back
to
life
none
that
be
so
good
and
kind
as
ye
are
would
do
her
that
cruel
hurt
for
look
youwhat
is
left
to
live
for
her
brothers
are
gone
her
father
is
gone
her
mother
goeth
the
churchs
curse
is
upon
her
and
none
may
shelter
or
befriend
her
even
though
she
lay
perishing
in
the
road
she
is
desolate
i
have
not
asked
you
good
heart
if
her
sister
be
still
on
live
here
overhead
i
had
no
need
ye
had
gone
back
else
and
not
left
the
poor
thing
forsaken
she
lieth
at
peace
interrupted
the
king
in
a
subdued
voice
i
would
not
change
it
how
rich
is
this
day
in
happiness
ah
my
annis
thou
shalt
join
thy
sister
soonthourt
on
thy
way
and
these
be
merciful
friends
that
will
not
hinder
and
so
she
fell
to
murmuring
and
cooing
over
the
girl
again
and
softly
stroking
her
face
and
hair
and
kissing
her
and
calling
her
by
endearing
names
but
there
was
scarcely
sign
of
response
now
in
the
glazing
eyes
i
saw
tears
well
from
the
kings
eyes
and
trickle
down
his
face
the
woman
noticed
them
too
and
said
ah
i
know
that
sign
thoust
a
wife
at
home
poor
soul
and
you
and
she
have
gone
hungry
to
bed
manys
the
time
that
the
little
ones
might
have
your
crust
you
know
what
poverty
is
and
the
daily
insults
of
your
betters
and
the
heavy
hand
of
the
church
and
the
king
the
king
winced
under
this
accidental
homeshot
but
kept
still
he
was
learning
his
part
and
he
was
playing
it
well
too
for
a
pretty
dull
beginner
i
struck
up
a
diversion
i
offered
the
woman
food
and
liquor
but
she
refused
both
she
would
allow
nothing
to
come
between
her
and
the
release
of
death
then
i
slipped
away
and
brought
the
dead
child
from
aloft
and
laid
it
by
her
this
broke
her
down
again
and
there
was
another
scene
that
was
full
of
heartbreak
by
and
by
i
made
another
diversion
and
beguiled
her
to
sketch
her
story
ye
know
it
well
yourselves
having
suffered
itfor
truly
none
of
our
condition
in
britain
escape
it
it
is
the
old
weary
tale
we
fought
and
struggled
and
succeeded
meaning
by
success
that
we
lived
and
did
not
die
more
than
that
is
not
to
be
claimed
no
troubles
came
that
we
could
not
outlive
till
this
year
brought
them
then
came
they
all
at
once
as
one
might
say
and
overwhelmed
us
years
ago
the
lord
of
the
manor
planted
certain
fruit
trees
on
our
farm
in
the
best
part
of
it
tooa
grievous
wrong
and
shame
but
it
was
his
right
interrupted
the
king
none
denieth
that
indeed
an
the
law
mean
anything
what
is
the
lords
is
his
and
what
is
mine
is
his
also
our
farm
was
ours
by
lease
therefore
twas
likewise
his
to
do
with
it
as
he
would
some
little
time
ago
three
of
those
trees
were
found
hewn
down
our
three
grown
sons
ran
frightened
to
report
the
crime
well
in
his
lordships
dungeon
there
they
lie
who
saith
there
shall
they
lie
and
rot
till
they
confess
they
have
naught
to
confess
being
innocent
wherefore
there
will
they
remain
until
they
die
ye
know
that
right
well
i
ween
think
how
this
left
us
a
man
a
woman
and
two
children
to
gather
a
crop
that
was
planted
by
so
much
greater
force
yes
and
protect
it
night
and
day
from
pigeons
and
prowling
animals
that
be
sacred
and
must
not
be
hurt
by
any
of
our
sort
when
my
lords
crop
was
nearly
ready
for
the
harvest
so
also
was
ours
when
his
bell
rang
to
call
us
to
his
fields
to
harvest
his
crop
for
nothing
he
would
not
allow
that
i
and
my
two
girls
should
count
for
our
three
captive
sons
but
for
only
two
of
them
so
for
the
lacking
one
were
we
daily
fined
all
this
time
our
own
crop
was
perishing
through
neglect
and
so
both
the
priest
and
his
lordship
fined
us
because
their
shares
of
it
were
suffering
through
damage
in
the
end
the
fines
ate
up
our
cropand
they
took
it
all
they
took
it
all
and
made
us
harvest
it
for
them
without
pay
or
food
and
we
starving
then
the
worst
came
when
i
being
out
of
my
mind
with
hunger
and
loss
of
my
boys
and
grief
to
see
my
husband
and
my
little
maids
in
rags
and
misery
and
despair
uttered
a
deep
blasphemyoh
a
thousand
of
them
against
the
church
and
the
churchs
ways
it
was
ten
days
ago
i
had
fallen
sick
with
this
disease
and
it
was
to
the
priest
i
said
the
words
for
he
was
come
to
chide
me
for
lack
of
due
humility
under
the
chastening
hand
of
god
he
carried
my
trespass
to
his
betters
i
was
stubborn
wherefore
presently
upon
my
head
and
upon
all
heads
that
were
dear
to
me
fell
the
curse
of
rome
since
that
day
we
are
avoided
shunned
with
horror
none
has
come
near
this
hut
to
know
whether
we
live
or
not
the
rest
of
us
were
taken
down
then
i
roused
me
and
got
up
as
wife
and
mother
will
it
was
little
they
could
have
eaten
in
any
case
it
was
less
than
little
they
had
to
eat
but
there
was
water
and
i
gave
them
that
how
they
craved
it
and
how
they
blessed
it
but
the
end
came
yesterday
my
strength
broke
down
yesterday
was
the
last
time
i
ever
saw
my
husband
and
this
youngest
child
alive
i
have
lain
here
all
these
hoursthese
ages
ye
may
saylistening
listening
for
any
sound
up
there
that
she
gave
a
sharp
quick
glance
at
her
eldest
daughter
then
cried
out
oh
my
darling
and
feebly
gathered
the
stiffening
form
to
her
sheltering
arms
she
had
recognized
the
deathrattle
chapter
xxx
the
tragedy
of
the
manorhouse
at
midnight
all
was
over
and
we
sat
in
the
presence
of
four
corpses
we
covered
them
with
such
rags
as
we
could
find
and
started
away
fastening
the
door
behind
us
their
home
must
be
these
peoples
grave
for
they
could
not
have
christian
burial
or
be
admitted
to
consecrated
ground
they
were
as
dogs
wild
beasts
lepers
and
no
soul
that
valued
its
hope
of
eternal
life
would
throw
it
away
by
meddling
in
any
sort
with
these
rebuked
and
smitten
outcasts
we
had
not
moved
four
steps
when
i
caught
a
sound
as
of
footsteps
upon
gravel
my
heart
flew
to
my
throat
we
must
not
be
seen
coming
from
that
house
i
plucked
at
the
kings
robe
and
we
drew
back
and
took
shelter
behind
the
corner
of
the
cabin
now
we
are
safe
i
said
but
it
was
a
close
callso
to
speak
if
the
night
had
been
lighter
he
might
have
seen
us
no
doubt
he
seemed
to
be
so
near
mayhap
it
is
but
a
beast
and
not
a
man
at
all
true
but
man
or
beast
it
will
be
wise
to
stay
here
a
minute
and
let
it
get
by
and
out
of
the
way
hark
it
cometh
hither
true
again
the
step
was
coming
toward
usstraight
toward
the
hut
it
must
be
a
beast
then
and
we
might
as
well
have
saved
our
trepidation
i
was
going
to
step
out
but
the
king
laid
his
hand
upon
my
arm
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
then
we
heard
a
soft
knock
on
the
cabin
door
it
made
me
shiver
presently
the
knock
was
repeated
and
then
we
heard
these
words
in
a
guarded
voice
mother
father
openwe
have
got
free
and
we
bring
news
to
pale
your
cheeks
but
glad
your
hearts
and
we
may
not
tarry
but
must
fly
andbut
they
answer
not
mother
father
i
drew
the
king
toward
the
other
end
of
the
hut
and
whispered
comenow
we
can
get
to
the
road
the
king
hesitated
was
going
to
demur
but
just
then
we
heard
the
door
give
way
and
knew
that
those
desolate
men
were
in
the
presence
of
their
dead
come
my
liege
in
a
moment
they
will
strike
a
light
and
then
will
follow
that
which
it
would
break
your
heart
to
hear
he
did
not
hesitate
this
time
the
moment
we
were
in
the
road
i
ran
and
after
a
moment
he
threw
dignity
aside
and
followed
i
did
not
want
to
think
of
what
was
happening
in
the
huti
couldnt
bear
it
i
wanted
to
drive
it
out
of
my
mind
so
i
struck
into
the
first
subject
that
lay
under
that
one
in
my
mind
i
have
had
the
disease
those
people
died
of
and
so
have
nothing
to
fear
but
if
you
have
not
had
it
also
he
broke
in
upon
me
to
say
he
was
in
trouble
and
it
was
his
conscience
that
was
troubling
him
these
young
men
have
got
free
they
saybut
how
it
is
not
likely
that
their
lord
hath
set
them
free
oh
no
i
make
no
doubt
they
escaped
that
is
my
trouble
i
have
a
fear
that
this
is
so
and
your
suspicion
doth
confirm
it
you
having
the
same
fear
i
should
not
call
it
by
that
name
though
i
do
suspect
that
they
escaped
but
if
they
did
i
am
not
sorry
certainly
i
am
not
sorry
i
thinkbut
what
is
it
what
is
there
for
one
to
be
troubled
about
if
they
did
escape
then
are
we
bound
in
duty
to
lay
hands
upon
them
and
deliver
them
again
to
their
lord
for
it
is
not
seemly
that
one
of
his
quality
should
suffer
a
so
insolent
and
highhanded
outrage
from
persons
of
their
base
degree
there
it
was
again
he
could
see
only
one
side
of
it
he
was
born
so
educated
so
his
veins
were
full
of
ancestral
blood
that
was
rotten
with
this
sort
of
unconscious
brutality
brought
down
by
inheritance
from
a
long
procession
of
hearts
that
had
each
done
its
share
toward
poisoning
the
stream
to
imprison
these
men
without
proof
and
starve
their
kindred
was
no
harm
for
they
were
merely
peasants
and
subject
to
the
will
and
pleasure
of
their
lord
no
matter
what
fearful
form
it
might
take
but
for
these
men
to
break
out
of
unjust
captivity
was
insult
and
outrage
and
a
thing
not
to
be
countenanced
by
any
conscientious
person
who
knew
his
duty
to
his
sacred
caste
i
worked
more
than
half
an
hour
before
i
got
him
to
change
the
subjectand
even
then
an
outside
matter
did
it
for
me
this
was
a
something
which
caught
our
eyes
as
we
struck
the
summit
of
a
small
hilla
red
glow
a
good
way
off
thats
a
fire
said
i
fires
interested
me
considerably
because
i
was
getting
a
good
deal
of
an
insurance
business
started
and
was
also
training
some
horses
and
building
some
steam
fireengines
with
an
eye
to
a
paid
fire
department
by
and
by
the
priests
opposed
both
my
fire
and
life
insurance
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
insolent
attempt
to
hinder
the
decrees
of
god
and
if
you
pointed
out
that
they
did
not
hinder
the
decrees
in
the
least
but
only
modified
the
hard
consequences
of
them
if
you
took
out
policies
and
had
luck
they
retorted
that
that
was
gambling
against
the
decrees
of
god
and
was
just
as
bad
so
they
managed
to
damage
those
industries
more
or
less
but
i
got
even
on
my
accident
business
as
a
rule
a
knight
is
a
lummux
and
some
times
even
a
labrick
and
hence
open
to
pretty
poor
arguments
when
they
come
glibly
from
a
superstitionmonger
but
even
he
could
see
the
practical
side
of
a
thing
once
in
a
while
and
so
of
late
you
couldnt
clean
up
a
tournament
and
pile
the
result
without
finding
one
of
my
accidenttickets
in
every
helmet
we
stood
there
awhile
in
the
thick
darkness
and
stillness
looking
toward
the
red
blur
in
the
distance
and
trying
to
make
out
the
meaning
of
a
faraway
murmur
that
rose
and
fell
fitfully
on
the
night
sometimes
it
swelled
up
and
for
a
moment
seemed
less
remote
but
when
we
were
hopefully
expecting
it
to
betray
its
cause
and
nature
it
dulled
and
sank
again
carrying
its
mystery
with
it
we
started
down
the
hill
in
its
direction
and
the
winding
road
plunged
us
at
once
into
almost
solid
darknessdarkness
that
was
packed
and
crammed
in
between
two
tall
forest
walls
we
groped
along
down
for
half
a
mile
perhaps
that
murmur
growing
more
and
more
distinct
all
the
time
the
coming
storm
threatening
more
and
more
with
now
and
then
a
little
shiver
of
wind
a
faint
show
of
lightning
and
dull
grumblings
of
distant
thunder
i
was
in
the
lead
i
ran
against
somethinga
soft
heavy
something
which
gave
slightly
to
the
impulse
of
my
weight
at
the
same
moment
the
lightning
glared
out
and
within
a
foot
of
my
face
was
the
writhing
face
of
a
man
who
was
hanging
from
the
limb
of
a
tree
that
is
it
seemed
to
be
writhing
but
it
was
not
it
was
a
grewsome
sight
straightway
there
was
an
earsplitting
explosion
of
thunder
and
the
bottom
of
heaven
fell
out
the
rain
poured
down
in
a
deluge
no
matter
we
must
try
to
cut
this
man
down
on
the
chance
that
there
might
be
life
in
him
yet
mustnt
we
the
lightning
came
quick
and
sharp
now
and
the
place
was
alternately
noonday
and
midnight
one
moment
the
man
would
be
hanging
before
me
in
an
intense
light
and
the
next
he
was
blotted
out
again
in
the
darkness
i
told
the
king
we
must
cut
him
down
the
king
at
once
objected
if
he
hanged
himself
he
was
willing
to
lose
him
property
to
his
lord
so
let
him
be
if
others
hanged
him
belike
they
had
the
rightlet
him
hang
but
but
me
no
buts
but
even
leave
him
as
he
is
and
for
yet
another
reason
when
the
lightning
cometh
againthere
look
abroad
two
others
hanging
within
fifty
yards
of
us
it
is
not
weather
meet
for
doing
useless
courtesies
unto
dead
folk
they
are
past
thanking
you
comeit
is
unprofitable
to
tarry
here
there
was
reason
in
what
he
said
so
we
moved
on
within
the
next
mile
we
counted
six
more
hanging
forms
by
the
blaze
of
the
lightning
and
altogether
it
was
a
grisly
excursion
that
murmur
was
a
murmur
no
longer
it
was
a
roar
a
roar
of
mens
voices
a
man
came
flying
by
now
dimly
through
the
darkness
and
other
men
chasing
him
they
disappeared
presently
another
case
of
the
kind
occurred
and
then
another
and
another
then
a
sudden
turn
of
the
road
brought
us
in
sight
of
that
fireit
was
a
large
manorhouse
and
little
or
nothing
was
left
of
itand
everywhere
men
were
flying
and
other
men
raging
after
them
in
pursuit
i
warned
the
king
that
this
was
not
a
safe
place
for
strangers
we
would
better
get
away
from
the
light
until
matters
should
improve
we
stepped
back
a
little
and
hid
in
the
edge
of
the
wood
from
this
hidingplace
we
saw
both
men
and
women
hunted
by
the
mob
the
fearful
work
went
on
until
nearly
dawn
then
the
fire
being
out
and
the
storm
spent
the
voices
and
flying
footsteps
presently
ceased
and
darkness
and
stillness
reigned
again
we
ventured
out
and
hurried
cautiously
away
and
although
we
were
worn
out
and
sleepy
we
kept
on
until
we
had
put
this
place
some
miles
behind
us
then
we
asked
hospitality
at
the
hut
of
a
charcoal
burner
and
got
what
was
to
be
had
a
woman
was
up
and
about
but
the
man
was
still
asleep
on
a
straw
shakedown
on
the
clay
floor
the
woman
seemed
uneasy
until
i
explained
that
we
were
travelers
and
had
lost
our
way
and
been
wandering
in
the
woods
all
night
she
became
talkative
then
and
asked
if
we
had
heard
of
the
terrible
goingson
at
the
manorhouse
of
abblasoure
yes
we
had
heard
of
them
but
what
we
wanted
now
was
rest
and
sleep
the
king
broke
in
sell
us
the
house
and
take
yourselves
away
for
we
be
perilous
company
being
late
come
from
people
that
died
of
the
spotted
death
it
was
good
of
him
but
unnecessary
one
of
the
commonest
decorations
of
the
nation
was
the
waffleiron
face
i
had
early
noticed
that
the
woman
and
her
husband
were
both
so
decorated
she
made
us
entirely
welcome
and
had
no
fears
and
plainly
she
was
immensely
impressed
by
the
kings
proposition
for
of
course
it
was
a
good
deal
of
an
event
in
her
life
to
run
across
a
person
of
the
kings
humble
appearance
who
was
ready
to
buy
a
mans
house
for
the
sake
of
a
nights
lodging
it
gave
her
a
large
respect
for
us
and
she
strained
the
lean
possibilities
of
her
hovel
to
the
utmost
to
make
us
comfortable
we
slept
till
far
into
the
afternoon
and
then
got
up
hungry
enough
to
make
cotter
fare
quite
palatable
to
the
king
the
more
particularly
as
it
was
scant
in
quantity
and
also
in
variety
it
consisted
solely
of
onions
salt
and
the
national
black
bread
made
out
of
horsefeed
the
woman
told
us
about
the
affair
of
the
evening
before
at
ten
or
eleven
at
night
when
everybody
was
in
bed
the
manorhouse
burst
into
flames
the
countryside
swarmed
to
the
rescue
and
the
family
were
saved
with
one
exception
the
master
he
did
not
appear
everybody
was
frantic
over
this
loss
and
two
brave
yeomen
sacrificed
their
lives
in
ransacking
the
burning
house
seeking
that
valuable
personage
but
after
a
while
he
was
foundwhat
was
left
of
himwhich
was
his
corpse
it
was
in
a
copse
three
hundred
yards
away
bound
gagged
stabbed
in
a
dozen
places
who
had
done
this
suspicion
fell
upon
a
humble
family
in
the
neighborhood
who
had
been
lately
treated
with
peculiar
harshness
by
the
baron
and
from
these
people
the
suspicion
easily
extended
itself
to
their
relatives
and
familiars
a
suspicion
was
enough
my
lords
liveried
retainers
proclaimed
an
instant
crusade
against
these
people
and
were
promptly
joined
by
the
community
in
general
the
womans
husband
had
been
active
with
the
mob
and
had
not
returned
home
until
nearly
dawn
he
was
gone
now
to
find
out
what
the
general
result
had
been
while
we
were
still
talking
he
came
back
from
his
quest
his
report
was
revolting
enough
eighteen
persons
hanged
or
butchered
and
two
yeomen
and
thirteen
prisoners
lost
in
the
fire
and
how
many
prisoners
were
there
altogether
in
the
vaults
thirteen
then
every
one
of
them
was
lost
yes
all
but
the
people
arrived
in
time
to
save
the
family
how
is
it
they
could
save
none
of
the
prisoners
the
man
looked
puzzled
and
said
would
one
unlock
the
vaults
at
such
a
time
marry
some
would
have
escaped
then
you
mean
that
nobody
did
unlock
them
none
went
near
them
either
to
lock
or
unlock
it
standeth
to
reason
that
the
bolts
were
fast
wherefore
it
was
only
needful
to
establish
a
watch
so
that
if
any
broke
the
bonds
he
might
not
escape
but
be
taken
none
were
taken
natheless
three
did
escape
said
the
king
and
ye
will
do
well
to
publish
it
and
set
justice
upon
their
track
for
these
murthered
the
baron
and
fired
the
house
i
was
just
expecting
he
would
come
out
with
that
for
a
moment
the
man
and
his
wife
showed
an
eager
interest
in
this
news
and
an
impatience
to
go
out
and
spread
it
then
a
sudden
something
else
betrayed
itself
in
their
faces
and
they
began
to
ask
questions
i
answered
the
questions
myself
and
narrowly
watched
the
effects
produced
i
was
soon
satisfied
that
the
knowledge
of
who
these
three
prisoners
were
had
somehow
changed
the
atmosphere
that
our
hosts
continued
eagerness
to
go
and
spread
the
news
was
now
only
pretended
and
not
real
the
king
did
not
notice
the
change
and
i
was
glad
of
that
i
worked
the
conversation
around
toward
other
details
of
the
nights
proceedings
and
noted
that
these
people
were
relieved
to
have
it
take
that
direction
the
painful
thing
observable
about
all
this
business
was
the
alacrity
with
which
this
oppressed
community
had
turned
their
cruel
hands
against
their
own
class
in
the
interest
of
the
common
oppressor
this
man
and
woman
seemed
to
feel
that
in
a
quarrel
between
a
person
of
their
own
class
and
his
lord
it
was
the
natural
and
proper
and
rightful
thing
for
that
poor
devils
whole
caste
to
side
with
the
master
and
fight
his
battle
for
him
without
ever
stopping
to
inquire
into
the
rights
or
wrongs
of
the
matter
this
man
had
been
out
helping
to
hang
his
neighbors
and
had
done
his
work
with
zeal
and
yet
was
aware
that
there
was
nothing
against
them
but
a
mere
suspicion
with
nothing
back
of
it
describable
as
evidence
still
neither
he
nor
his
wife
seemed
to
see
anything
horrible
about
it
this
was
depressingto
a
man
with
the
dream
of
a
republic
in
his
head
it
reminded
me
of
a
time
thirteen
centuries
away
when
the
poor
whites
of
our
south
who
were
always
despised
and
frequently
insulted
by
the
slavelords
around
them
and
who
owed
their
base
condition
simply
to
the
presence
of
slavery
in
their
midst
were
yet
pusillanimously
ready
to
side
with
the
slavelords
in
all
political
moves
for
the
upholding
and
perpetuating
of
slavery
and
did
also
finally
shoulder
their
muskets
and
pour
out
their
lives
in
an
effort
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
that
very
institution
which
degraded
them
and
there
was
only
one
redeeming
feature
connected
with
that
pitiful
piece
of
history
and
that
was
that
secretly
the
poor
white
did
detest
the
slavelord
and
did
feel
his
own
shame
that
feeling
was
not
brought
to
the
surface
but
the
fact
that
it
was
there
and
could
have

under

circumstances
was
somethingin
fact
it
was
enough
for
it
showed
that
a
man
is
at
bottom
a
man
after
all
even
if
it
doesnt
show
on
the
outside
well
as
it
turned
out
this
charcoal
burner
was
just
the
twin
of
the
southern
poor
white
of
the
far
future
the
king
presently
showed
impatience
and
said
an
ye
prattle
here
all
the
day
justice
will
miscarry
think
ye
the
criminals
will
abide
in
their
fathers
house
they
are
fleeing
they
are
not
waiting
you
should
look
to
it
that
a
party
of
horse
be
set
upon
their
track
the
woman
paled
slightly
but
quite
perceptibly
and
the
man
looked
flustered
and
irresolute
i
said
come
friend
i
will
walk
a
little
way
with
you
and
explain
which
direction
i
think
they
would
try
to
take
if
they
were
merely
resisters
of
the
gabelle
or
some
kindred
absurdity
i
would
try
to
protect
them
from
capture
but
when
men
murder
a
person
of
high
degree
and
likewise
burn
his
house
that
is
another
matter
the
last
remark
was
for
the
kingto
quiet
him
on
the
road
the
man
pulled
his
resolution
together
and
began
the
march
with
a
steady
gait
but
there
was
no
eagerness
in
it
by
and
by
i
said
what
relation
were
these
men
to
youcousins
he
turned
as
white
as
his
layer
of
charcoal
would
let
him
and
stopped
trembling
ah
my
god
how
know
ye
that
i
didnt
know
it
it
was
a
chance
guess
poor
lads
they
are
lost
and
good
lads
they
were
too
were
you
actually
going
yonder
to
tell
on
them
he
didnt
quite
know
how
to
take
that
but
he
said
hesitatingly
yes
then
i
think
you
are
a
damned
scoundrel
it
made
him
as
glad
as
if
i
had
called
him
an
angel
say
the
good
words
again
brother
for
surely
ye
mean
that
ye
would
not
betray
me
an
i
failed
of
my
duty
duty
there
is
no
duty
in
the
matter
except
the
duty
to
keep
still
and
let
those
men
get
away
theyve
done
a
righteous
deed
he
looked
pleased
pleased
and
touched
with
apprehension
at
the
same
time
he
looked
up
and
down
the
road
to
see
that
no
one
was
coming
and
then
said
in
a
cautious
voice
from
what
land
come
you
brother
that
you
speak
such
perilous
words
and
seem
not
to
be
afraid
they
are
not
perilous
words
when
spoken
to
one
of
my
own
caste
i
take
it
you
would
not
tell
anybody
i
said
them
i
i
would
be
drawn
asunder
by
wild
horses
first
well
then
let
me
say
my
say
i
have
no
fears
of
your
repeating
it
i
think
devils
work
has
been
done
last
night
upon
those
innocent
poor
people
that
old
baron
got
only
what
he
deserved
if
i
had
my
way
all
his
kind
should
have
the
same
luck
fear
and
depression
vanished
from
the
mans
manner
and
gratefulness
and
a
brave
animation
took
their
place
even
though
you
be
a
spy
and
your
words
a
trap
for
my
undoing
yet
are
they
such
refreshment
that
to
hear
them
again
and
others
like
to
them
i
would
go
to
the
gallows
happy
as
having
had
one
good
feast
at
least
in
a
starved
life
and
i
will
say
my
say
now
and
ye
may
report
it
if
ye
be
so
minded
i
helped
to
hang
my
neighbors
for
that
it
were

to
my

to
show
lack

the

for
none

today
that

the

i
have
said
the

the
only
ones
that
have
ever
tasted
good
in
my
mouth
and
the
reward
of
that

chapter
xxxi
marco
we
strolled
along
in
a
sufficiently
indolent
fashion
now
and
talked
we
must
dispose
of
about
the
amount
of
time
it
ought
to
take
to
go
to
the
little
hamlet
of
abblasoure
and
put
justice
on
the
track
of
those
murderers
and
get
back
home
again
and
meantime
i
had
an
auxiliary
interest
which
had
never
paled
yet
never
lost
its
novelty
for
me
since
i
had
been
in
arthurs
kingdom
the
behaviorborn
of
nice
and
exact
subdivisions
of
casteof
chance
passersby
toward
each
other
toward
the
shaven
monk
who
trudged
along
with
his
cowl
tilted
back
and
the
sweat
washing
down
his
fat
jowls
the
coalburner
was
deeply
reverent
to
the
gentleman
he
was
abject
with
the
small
farmer
and
the
free
mechanic
he
was
cordial
and
gossipy
and
when
a
slave
passed
by
with
a
countenance
respectfully
lowered
this
chaps
nose
was
in
the
airhe
couldnt
even
see
him
well
there
are
times
when
one
would
like
to
hang
the
whole
human
race
and
finish
the
farce
presently
we
struck
an
incident
a
small
mob
of
halfnaked
boys
and
girls
came
tearing
out
of
the
woods
scared
and
shrieking
the
eldest
among
them
were
not
more
than
twelve
or
fourteen
years
old
they
implored
help
but
they
were
so
beside
themselves
that
we
couldnt
make
out
what
the
matter
was
however
we
plunged
into
the
wood
they
skurrying
in
the
lead
and
the
trouble
was
quickly
revealed
they
had
hanged
a
little
fellow
with
a
bark
rope
and
he
was
kicking
and
struggling
in
the
process
of
choking
to
death
we
rescued
him
and
fetched
him
around
it
was
some
more
human
nature
the
admiring
little
folk
imitating
their
elders
they
were
playing
mob
and
had
achieved
a
success
which
promised
to
be
a
good
deal
more
serious
than
they
had
bargained
for
it
was
not
a
dull
excursion
for
me
i
managed
to
put
in
the
time
very
well
i
made
various
acquaintanceships
and
in
my
quality
of
stranger
was
able
to
ask
as
many
questions
as
i
wanted
to
a
thing
which
naturally
interested
me
as
a
statesman
was
the
matter
of
wages
i
picked
up
what
i
could
under
that
head
during
the
afternoon
a
man
who
hasnt
had
much
experience
and
doesnt
think
is
apt
to
measure
a
nations
prosperity
or
lack
of
prosperity
by
the
mere
size
of
the
prevailing
wages
if
the
wages
be
high
the
nation
is
prosperous
if
low
it
isnt
which
is
an
error
it
isnt
what
sum
you
get
its
how
much
you
can
buy
with
it
thats
the
important
thing
and
its
that
that
tells
whether
your
wages
are
high
in
fact
or
only
high
in
name
i
could
remember
how
it
was
in
the
time
of
our
great
civil
war
in
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
north
a
carpenter
got
three
dollars
a
day
gold
valuation
in
the
south
he
got
fiftypayable
in
confederate
shinplasters
worth
a
dollar
a
bushel
in
the
north
a
suit
of
overalls
cost
three
dollarsa
days
wages
in
the
south
it
cost
seventyfive
which
was
two
days
wages
other
things
were
in
proportion
consequently
wages
were
twice
as
high
in
the
north
as
they
were
in
the
south
because
the
one
wage
had
that
much
more
purchasing
power
than
the
other
had
yes
i
made
various
acquaintances
in
the
hamlet
and
a
thing
that
gratified
me
a
good
deal
was
to
find
our
new
coins
in
circulation
lots
of
milrays
lots
of
mills
lots
of
cents
a
good
many
nickels
and
some
silver
all
this
among
the
artisans
and
commonalty
generally
yes
and
even
some
goldbut
that
was
at
the
bank
that
is
to
say
the
goldsmiths
i
dropped
in
there
while
marco
the
son
of
marco
was
haggling
with
a
shopkeeper
over
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
salt
and
asked
for
change
for
a
twentydollar
gold
piece
they
furnished
itthat
is
after
they
had
chewed
the
piece
and
rung
it
on
the
counter
and
tried
acid
on
it
and
asked
me
where
i
got
it
and
who
i
was
and
where
i
was
from
and
where
i
was
going
to
and
when
i
expected
to
get
there
and
perhaps
a
couple
of
hundred
more
questions
and
when
they
got
aground
i
went
right
on
and
furnished
them
a
lot
of
information
voluntarily
told
them
i
owned
a
dog
and
his
name
was
watch
and
my
first
wife
was
a
free
will
baptist
and
her
grandfather
was
a
prohibitionist
and
i
used
to
know
a
man
who
had
two
thumbs
on
each
hand
and
a
wart
on
the
inside
of
his
upper
lip
and
died
in
the
hope
of
a
glorious
resurrection
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
even
that
hungry
village
questioner
began
to
look
satisfied
and
also
a
shade
put
out
but
he
had
to
respect
a
man
of
my
financial
strength
and
so
he
didnt
give
me
any
lip
but
i
noticed
he
took
it
out
of
his
underlings
which
was
a
perfectly
natural
thing
to
do
yes
they
changed
my
twenty
but
i
judged
it
strained
the
bank
a
little
which
was
a
thing
to
be
expected
for
it
was
the
same
as
walking
into
a
paltry
village
store
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
requiring
the
boss
of
it
to
change
a
two
thousanddollar
bill
for
you
all
of
a
sudden
he
could
do
it
maybe
but
at
the
same
time
he
would
wonder
how
a
small
farmer
happened
to
be
carrying
so
much
money
around
in
his
pocket
which
was
probably
this
goldsmiths
thought
too
for
he
followed
me
to
the
door
and
stood
there
gazing
after
me
with
reverent
admiration
our
new
money
was
not
only
handsomely
circulating
but
its
language
was
already
glibly
in
use
that
is
to
say
people
had
dropped
the
names
of
the
former
moneys
and
spoke
of
things
as
being
worth
so
many
dollars
or
cents
or
mills
or
milrays
now
it
was
very
gratifying
we
were
progressing
that
was
sure
i
got
to
know
several
master
mechanics
but
about
the
most
interesting
fellow
among
them
was
the
blacksmith
dowley
he
was
a
live
man
and
a
brisk
talker
and
had
two
journeymen
and
three
apprentices
and
was
doing
a
raging
business
in
fact
he
was
getting
rich
hand
over
fist
and
was
vastly
respected
marco
was
very
proud
of
having
such
a
man
for
a
friend
he
had
taken
me
there
ostensibly
to
let
me
see
the
big
establishment
which
bought
so
much
of
his
charcoal
but
really
to
let
me
see
what
easy
and
almost
familiar
terms
he
was
on
with
this
great
man
dowley
and
i
fraternized
at
once
i
had
had
just
such
picked
men
splendid
fellows
under
me
in
the
colt
arms
factory
i
was
bound
to
see
more
of
him
so
i
invited
him
to
come
out
to
marcos
sunday
and
dine
with
us
marco
was
appalled
and
held
his
breath
and
when
the
grandee
accepted
he
was
so
grateful
that
he
almost
forgot
to
be
astonished
at
the
condescension
marcos
joy
was
exuberantbut
only
for
a
moment
then
he
grew
thoughtful
then
sad
and
when
he
heard
me
tell
dowley
i
should
have
dickon
the
boss
mason
and
smug
the
boss
wheelwright
out
there
too
the
coaldust
on
his
face
turned
to
chalk
and
he
lost
his
grip
but
i
knew
what
was
the
matter
with
him
it
was
the
expense
he
saw
ruin
before
him
he
judged
that
his
financial
days
were
numbered
however
on
our
way
to
invite
the
others
i
said
you
must
allow
me
to
have
these
friends
come
and
you
must
also
allow
me
to
pay
the
costs
his
face
cleared
and
he
said
with
spirit
but
not
all
of
it
not
all
of
it
ye
cannot
well
bear
a
burden
like
to
this
alone
i
stopped
him
and
said
now
lets
understand
each
other
on
the
spot
old
friend
i
am
only
a
farm
bailiff
it
is
true
but
i
am
not
poor
nevertheless
i
have
been
very
fortunate
this
yearyou
would
be
astonished
to
know
how
i
have
thriven
i
tell
you
the
honest
truth
when
i
say
i
could
squander
away
as
many
as
a
dozen
feasts
like
this
and
never
care
that
for
the
expense
and
i
snapped
my
fingers
i
could
see
myself
rise
a
foot
at
a
time
in
marcos
estimation
and
when
i
fetched
out
those
last
words
i
was
become
a
very
tower
for
style
and
altitude
so
you
see
you
must
let
me
have
my
way
you
cant
contribute
a
cent
to
this
orgy
thats
settled
its
grand
and
good
of
you
no
it
isnt
youve
opened
your
house
to
jones
and
me
in
the
most
generous
way
jones
was
remarking
upon
it
today
just
before
you
came
back
from
the
village
for
although
he
wouldnt
be
likely
to
say
such
a
thing
to
youbecause
jones
isnt
a
talker
and
is
diffident
in
societyhe
has
a
good
heart
and
a
grateful
and
knows
how
to
appreciate
it
when
he
is
well
treated
yes
you
and
your
wife
have
been
very
hospitable
toward
us
ah
brother
tis
nothingsuch
hospitality
but
it
is
something
the
best
a
man
has
freely
given
is
always
something
and
is
as
good
as
a
prince
can
do
and
ranks
right
along
beside
itfor
even
a
prince
can
but
do
his
best
and
so
well
shop
around
and
get
up
this
layout
now
and
dont
you
worry
about
the
expense
im
one
of
the
worst
spendthrifts
that
ever
was
born
why
do
you
know
sometimes
in
a
single
week
i
spend
but
never
mind
about
thatyoud
never
believe
it
anyway
and
so
we
went
gadding
along
dropping
in
here
and
there
pricing
things
and
gossiping
with
the
shopkeepers
about
the
riot
and
now
and
then
running
across
pathetic
reminders
of
it
in
the
persons
of
shunned
and
tearful
and
houseless
remnants
of
families
whose
homes
had
been
taken
from
them
and
their
parents
butchered
or
hanged
the
raiment
of
marco
and
his
wife
was
of
coarse
towlinen
and
linseywoolsey
respectively
and
resembled
township
maps
it
being
made
up
pretty
exclusively
of
patches
which
had
been
added
township
by
township
in
the
course
of
five
or
six
years
until
hardly
a
handsbreadth
of
the
original
garments
was
surviving
and
present
now
i
wanted
to
fit
these
people
out
with
new
suits
on
account
of
that
swell
company
and
i
didnt
know
just
how
to
get
at
it
with
delicacy
until
at
last
it
struck
me
that
as
i
had
already
been
liberal
in
inventing
wordy
gratitude
for
the
king
it
would
be
just
the
thing
to
back
it
up
with
evidence
of
a
substantial
sort
so
i
said
and
marco
theres
another
thing
which
you
must
permitout
of
kindness
for
jonesbecause
you
wouldnt
want
to
offend
him
he
was
very
anxious
to
testify
his
appreciation
in
some
way
but
he
is
so
diffident
he
couldnt
venture
it
himself
and
so
he
begged
me
to
buy
some
little
things
and
give
them
to
you
and
dame
phyllis
and
let
him
pay
for
them
without
your
ever
knowing
they
came
from
himyou
know
how
a
delicate
person
feels
about
that
sort
of
thing
and
so
i
said
i
would
and
we
would
keep
mum
well
his
idea
was
a
new
outfit
of
clothes
for
you
both
oh
it
is
wastefulness
it
may
not
be
brother
it
may
not
be

the
vastness
of
the

to

quiet
for
a

how
it
would
seem

you
talk

you
ought

it
will

you

yes
well
step
in

now
and
price

mans
stuffand
dont
forget
to
remember
to
not
let
on
to
jones
that
you
know
he
had
anything
to
do
with
it
you
cant
think
how
curiously
sensitive
and
proud
he
is
hes
a
farmerpretty
fairly
welltodo
farmer
and
im
his
bailiff
butthe
imagination
of
that
man
why
sometimes
when
he
forgets
himself
and
gets
to
blowing
off
youd
think
he
was
one
of
the
swells
of
the
earth
and
you
might
listen
to
him
a
hundred
years
and
never
take
him
for
a
farmerespecially
if
he
talked
agriculture
he
thinks
hes
a
sheol
of
a
farmer
thinks
hes
old
grayback
from
wayback
but
between
you
and
me
privately
he
dont
know
as
much
about
farming
as
he
does
about
running
a
kingdomstill
whatever
he
talks
about
you
want
to
drop
your
underjaw
and
listen
the
same
as
if
you
had
never
heard
such
incredible
wisdom
in
all
your
life
before
and
were
afraid
you
might
die
before
you
got
enough
of
it
that
will
please
jones
it
tickled
marco
to
the
marrow
to
hear
about
such
an
odd
character
but
it
also
prepared
him
for
accidents
and
in
my
experience
when
you
travel
with
a
king
who
is
letting
on
to
be
something
else
and
cant
remember
it
more
than
about
half
the
time
you
cant
take
too
many
precautions
this
was
the
best
store
we
had
come
across
yet
it
had
everything
in
it
in
small
quantities
from
anvils
and
drygoods
all
the
way
down
to
fish
and
pinchbeck
jewelry
i
concluded
i
would
bunch
my
whole
invoice
right
here
and
not
go
pricing
around
any
more
so
i
got
rid
of
marco
by
sending
him
off
to
invite
the
mason
and
the
wheelwright
which
left
the
field
free
to
me
for
i
never
care
to
do
a
thing
in
a
quiet
way
its
got
to
be
theatrical
or
i
dont
take
any
interest
in
it
i
showed
up
money
enough
in
a
careless
way
to
corral
the
shopkeepers
respect
and
then
i
wrote
down
a
list
of
the
things
i
wanted
and
handed
it
to
him
to
see
if
he
could
read
it
he
could
and
was
proud
to
show
that
he
could
he
said
he
had
been
educated
by
a
priest
and
could
both
read
and
write
he
ran
it
through
and
remarked
with
satisfaction
that
it
was
a
pretty
heavy
bill
well
and
so
it
was
for
a
little
concern
like
that
i
was
not
only
providing
a
swell
dinner
but
some
odds
and
ends
of
extras
i
ordered
that
the
things
be
carted
out
and
delivered
at
the
dwelling
of
marco
the
son
of
marco
by
saturday
evening
and
send
me
the
bill
at
dinnertime
sunday
he
said
i
could
depend
upon
his
promptness
and
exactitude
it
was
the
rule
of
the
house
he
also
observed
that
he
would
throw
in
a
couple
of
millerguns
for
the
marcos
gratisthat
everybody
was
using
them
now
he
had
a
mighty
opinion
of
that
clever
device
i
said
and
please
fill
them
up
to
the
middle
mark
too
and
add
that
to
the
bill
he
would
with
pleasure
he
filled
them
and
i
took
them
with
me
i
couldnt
venture
to
tell
him
that
the
millergun
was
a
little
invention
of
my
own
and
that
i
had
officially
ordered
that
every
shopkeeper
in
the
kingdom
keep
them
on
hand
and
sell
them
at
government
pricewhich
was
the
merest
trifle
and
the
shopkeeper
got
that
not
the
government
we
furnished
them
for
nothing
the
king
had
hardly
missed
us
when
we
got
back
at
nightfall
he
had
early
dropped
again
into
his
dream
of
a
grand
invasion
of
gaul
with
the
whole
strength
of
his
kingdom
at
his
back
and
the
afternoon
had
slipped
away
without
his
ever
coming
to
himself
again
chapter
xxxii
dowleys
humiliation
well
when
that
cargo
arrived
toward
sunset
saturday
afternoon
i
had
my
hands
full
to
keep
the
marcos
from
fainting
they
were
sure
jones
and
i
were
ruined
past
help
and
they
blamed
themselves
as
accessories
to
this
bankruptcy
you
see
in
addition
to
the
dinnermaterials
which
called
for
a
sufficiently
round
sum
i
had
bought
a
lot
of
extras
for
the
future
comfort
of
the
family
for
instance
a
big
lot
of
wheat
a
delicacy
as
rare
to
the
tables
of
their
class
as
was
icecream
to
a
hermits
also
a
sizeable
deal
dinnertable
also
two
entire
pounds
of
salt
which
was
another
piece
of
extravagance
in
those
peoples
eyes
also
crockery
stools
the
clothes
a
small
cask
of
beer
and
so
on
i
instructed
the
marcos
to
keep
quiet
about
this
sumptuousness
so
as
to
give
me
a
chance
to
surprise
the
guests
and
show
off
a
little
concerning
the
new
clothes
the
simple
couple
were
like
children
they
were
up
and
down
all
night
to
see
if
it
wasnt
nearly
daylight
so
that
they
could
put
them
on
and
they
were
into
them
at
last
as
much
as
an
hour
before
dawn
was
due
then
their
pleasurenot
to
say
deliriumwas
so
fresh
and
novel
and
inspiring
that
the
sight
of
it
paid
me
well
for
the
interruptions
which
my
sleep
had
suffered
the
king
had
slept
just
as
usuallike
the
dead
the
marcos
could
not
thank
him
for
their
clothes
that
being
forbidden
but
they
tried
every
way
they
could
think
of
to
make
him
see
how
grateful
they
were
which
all
went
for
nothing
he
didnt
notice
any
change
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
those
rich
and
rare
fall
days
which
is
just
a
june
day
toned
down
to
a
degree
where
it
is
heaven
to
be
out
of
doors
toward
noon
the
guests
arrived
and
we
assembled
under
a
great
tree
and
were
soon
as
sociable
as
old
acquaintances
even
the
kings
reserve
melted
a
little
though
it
was
some
little
trouble
to
him
to
adjust
himself
to
the
name
of
jones
along
at
first
i
had
asked
him
to
try
to
not
forget
that
he
was
a
farmer
but
i
had
also
considered
it
prudent
to
ask
him
to
let
the
thing
stand
at
that
and
not
elaborate
it
any
because
he
was
just
the
kind
of
person
you
could
depend
on
to
spoil
a
little
thing
like
that
if
you
didnt
warn
him
his
tongue
was
so
handy
and
his
spirit
so
willing
and
his
information
so
uncertain
dowley
was
in
fine
feather
and
i
early
got
him
started
and
then
adroitly
worked
him
around
onto
his
own
history
for
a
text
and
himself
for
a
hero
and
then
it
was
good
to
sit
there
and
hear
him
hum
selfmade
man
you
know
they
know
how
to
talk
they
do
deserve
more
credit
than
any
other
breed
of
men
yes
that
is
true
and
they
are
among
the
very
first
to
find
it
out
too
he
told
how
he
had
begun
life
an
orphan
lad
without
money
and
without
friends
able
to
help
him
how
he
had
lived
as
the
slaves
of
the
meanest
master
lived
how
his
days
work
was
from
sixteen
to
eighteen
hours
long
and
yielded
him
only
enough
black
bread
to
keep
him
in
a
halffed
condition
how
his
faithful
endeavors
finally
attracted
the
attention
of
a
good
blacksmith
who
came
near
knocking
him
dead
with
kindness
by
suddenly
offering
when
he
was
totally
unprepared
to
take
him
as
his
bound
apprentice
for
nine
years
and
give
him
board
and
clothes
and
teach
him
the
tradeor
mystery
as
dowley
called
it
that
was
his
first
great
rise
his
first
gorgeous
stroke
of
fortune
and
you
saw
that
he
couldnt
yet
speak
of
it
without
a
sort
of
eloquent
wonder
and
delight
that
such
a
gilded
promotion
should
have
fallen
to
the
lot
of
a
common
human
being
he
got
no
new
clothing
during
his
apprenticeship
but
on
his
graduation
day
his
master
tricked
him
out
in
spangnew
towlinens
and
made
him
feel
unspeakably
rich
and
fine
i
remember
me
of
that
day
the
wheelwright
sang
out
with
enthusiasm
and
i
likewise
cried
the
mason
i
would
not
believe
they
were
thine
own
in
faith
i
could
not
nor
other
shouted
dowley
with
sparkling
eyes
i
was
like
to
lose
my
character
the
neighbors
wending
i
had
mayhap
been
stealing
it
was
a
great
day
a
great
day
one
forgetteth
not
days
like
that
yes
and
his
master
was
a
fine
man
and
prosperous
and
always
had
a
great
feast
of
meat
twice
in
the
year
and
with
it
white
bread
true
wheaten
bread
in
fact
lived
like
a
lord
so
to
speak
and
in
time
dowley
succeeded
to
the
business
and
married
the
daughter
and
now
consider
what
is
come
to
pass
said
he
impressively
two
times
in
every
month
there
is
fresh
meat
upon
my
table
he
made
a
pause
here
to
let
that
fact
sink
home
then
added
and
eight
times
salt
meat
it
is
even
true
said
the
wheelwright
with
bated
breath
i
know
it
of
mine
own
knowledge
said
the
mason
in
the
same
reverent
fashion
on
my
table
appeareth
white
bread
every
sunday
in
the
year
added
the
master
smith
with
solemnity
i
leave
it
to
your
own
consciences
friends
if
this
is
not
also
true
by
my
head
yes
cried
the
mason
i
can
testify
itand
i
do
said
the
wheelwright
and
as
to
furniture
ye
shall
say
yourselves
what
mine
equipment
is
he
waved
his
hand
in
fine
gesture
of
granting
frank
and
unhampered
freedom
of
speech
and
added
speak
as
ye
are
moved
speak
as
ye
would
speak
an
i
were
not
here
ye
have
five
stools
and
of
the
sweetest
workmanship
at
that
albeit
your
family
is
but
three
said
the
wheelwright
with
deep
respect
and
six
wooden
goblets
and
six
platters
of
wood
and
two
of
pewter
to
eat
and
drink
from
withal
said
the
mason
impressively
and
i
say
it
as
knowing
god
is
my
judge
and
we
tarry
not
here
alway
but
must
answer
at
the
last
day
for
the
things
said
in
the
body
be
they
false
or
be
they
sooth
now
ye
know
what
manner
of
man
i
am
brother
jones
said
the
smith
with
a
fine
and
friendly
condescension
and
doubtless
ye
would
look
to
find
me
a
man
jealous
of
his
due
of
respect
and
but
sparing
of
outgo
to
strangers
till
their
rating
and
quality
be
assured
but
trouble
yourself
not
as
concerning
that
wit
ye
well
ye
shall
find
me
a
man
that
regardeth
not
these
matters
but
is
willing
to
receive
any
he
as
his
fellow
and
equal
that
carrieth
a
right
heart
in
his
body
be
his
worldly
estate
howsoever
modest
and
in
token
of
it
here
is
my
hand
and
i
say
with
my
own
mouth
we
are
equalsequalsand
he
smiled
around
on
the
company
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
god
who
is
doing
the
handsome
and
gracious
thing
and
is
quite
well
aware
of
it
the
king
took
the
hand
with
a
poorly
disguised
reluctance
and
let
go
of
it
as
willingly
as
a
lady
lets
go
of
a
fish
all
of
which
had
a
good
effect
for
it
was
mistaken
for
an
embarrassment
natural
to
one
who
was
being
called
upon
by
greatness
the
dame
brought
out
the
table
now
and
set
it
under
the
tree
it
caused
a
visible
stir
of
surprise
it
being
brand
new
and
a
sumptuous
article
of
deal
but
the
surprise
rose
higher
still
when
the
dame
with
a
body
oozing
easy
indifference
at
every
pore
but
eyes
that
gave
it
all
away
by
absolutely
flaming
with
vanity
slowly
unfolded
an
actual
simonpure
tablecloth
and
spread
it
that
was
a
notch
above
even
the
blacksmiths
domestic
grandeurs
and
it
hit
him
hard
you
could
see
it
but
marco
was
in
paradise
you
could
see
that
too
then
the
dame
brought
two
fine
new
stoolswhew
that
was
a
sensation
it
was
visible
in
the
eyes
of
every
guest
then
she
brought
two
moreas
calmly
as
she
could
sensation
againwith
awed
murmurs
again
she
brought
two
walking
on
air
she
was
so
proud
the
guests
were
petrified
and
the
mason
muttered
there
is
that
about
earthly
pomps
which
doth
ever
move
to
reverence
as
the
dame
turned
away
marco
couldnt
help
slapping
on
the
climax
while
the
thing
was
hot
so
he
said
with
what
was
meant
for
a
languid
composure
but
was
a
poor
imitation
of
it
these
suffice
leave
the
rest
so
there
were
more
yet
it
was
a
fine
effect
i
couldnt
have
played
the
hand
better
myself
from
this
out
the
madam
piled
up
the
surprises
with
a
rush
that
fired
the
general
astonishment
up
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
in
the
shade
and
at
the
same
time
paralyzed
expression
of
it
down
to
gasped
ohs
and
ahs
and
mute
upliftings
of
hands
and
eyes
she
fetched

take
it
by
and
large
that
spread
laid
everything
far
and
away
in
the
shade
that
ever
that
crowd
had
seen
before
and
while
they
sat
there
just
simply
stupefied
with
wonder
and
awe
i
sort
of
waved
my
hand
as
if
by
accident
and
the
storekeepers
son
emerged
from

and
said
he

right
i
said
indifferently
what
is
the
amount
give

the

then
he
read
off
this
bill
while
those
three
amazed
men
listened
and
serene
waves
of
satisfaction
rolled
over
my
soul

alternate
waves

he
ceased
there
was
a
pale
and
awful
silence
not
a
limb
stirred
not
a
nostril
betrayed
the
passage
of
breath
is
that
all
i
asked
in
a
voice
of
the
most
perfect
calmness
all
fair
sir
save
that
certain
matters
of

moment
are
placed

sundries
if
it
would
like
you
i
will
sepa
it
is
of
no

i
said
accompanying
the
words
with
a
gesture
of
the
most
utter
indifference
give
me
the
grand
total
please
the
clerk
leaned
against
the
tree
to
stay
himself
and
said
thirtynine
thousand
one
hundred
and
fifty
milrays
the
wheelwright
fell
off
his
stool
the
others
grabbed
the
table
to
save
themselves
and
there
was
a
deep
and
general
ejaculation
of
god
be
with
us
in
the
day
of
disaster
the
clerk
hastened
to
say
my
father
chargeth
me
to
say
he
cannot
honorably
require
you
to
pay
it
all
at
this
time
and
therefore
only
prayeth
you
i
paid
no
more
heed
than
if
it
were
the
idle
breeze
but
with
an
air
of
indifference
amounting
almost
to
weariness
got
out
my
money
and
tossed
four
dollars
on
to
the
table
ah
you
should
have
seen
them
stare
the
clerk
was
astonished
and
charmed
he
asked
me
to
retain
one
of
the
dollars
as
security
until
he
could
go
to
town
and
i
interrupted
what
and
fetch
back
nine
cents
nonsense
take
the
whole
keep
the
change
there
was
an
amazed
murmur
to
this
effect
verily
this
being
is
made
of
money
he
throweth
it
away
even
as
if
it
were
dirt
the
blacksmith
was
a
crushed
man
the
clerk
took
his
money
and
reeled
away
drunk
with
fortune
i
said
to
marco
and
his
wife
good
folk
here
is
a
little
trifle
for
youhanding
the

as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
no
consequence
though
each
of
them
contained
fifteen
cents
in
solid
cash
and
while
the
poor
creatures
went
to
pieces
with
astonishment
and
gratitude
i
turned
to
the
others
and
said
as
calmly
as
one
would
ask
the
time
of
day
well
if
we
are
all
ready
i
judge
the
dinner
is
come
fall
to
ah
well
it
was
immense
yes
it
was
a
daisy
i
dont
know
that
i
ever
put
a
situation
together
better
or
got
happier
spectacular

out
of
the
materials
available
the
blacksmithwell
he
was
simply
mashed
land
i
wouldnt
have
felt
what
that
man
was
feeling
for
anything
in
the
world
here
he
had
been
blowing
and
bragging
about
his
grand
meatfeast
twice
a
year
and
his
fresh
meat
twice
a
month
and
his

his

and
six

and
all
of
a
sudden
here
comes
along
a
man
who
slashes
out
nearly
four
dollars
on
a
single
blowout
and
not
only
that
but
acts
as
if
it
made
him
tired
to
handle
such
small
sums
yes
dowley
was
a
good
deal
wilted
and
shrunkup
and
collapsed

sixth

economy
however
i
made
a
dead
set
at
him
and
before
the
first
third
of
the
dinner
was
reached
i
had
him
happy
again
it
was
easy
to
doin
a
country
of
ranks
and
castes
you
see
in
a
country
where
they
have
ranks
and
castes
a
man
isnt
ever
a
man
he
is
only
part
of
a
man
he
cant
ever
get
his
full
growth
you
prove
your
superiority
over
him
in
station
or
rank
or
fortune
and
thats
the
end
of
ithe
knuckles
down
you
cant
insult
him
after
that
no
i
dont
mean
quite
that
of
course
you
can
insult
him
i
only
mean
its
difficult
and
so
unless
youve
got
a
lot
of
useless
time
on
your
hands
it
doesnt
pay
to
try
i
had
the
smiths
reverence
now
because
i
was
apparently
immensely
prosperous
and
rich
i
could
have
had
his
adoration
if
i
had
had
some
little
gimcrack
title
of
nobility
and
not
only
his
but
any
commoners
in
the
land
though
he
were
the
mightiest
production
of
all
the
ages
in
intellect
worth

whereas
we
were
working

warmed
to
his
work
snuffed
an
advantage
in
the
air
and
began
to
put
questions
which
he
considered
pretty
awkward
ones
for
me
and
they
did
have
something

with

and
his
face
shone
upon
the
company
like
a
sunburst
but
i
didnt
scare
at
all
i
rigged
up
my
piledriver

the
way
i
started

i
prepared
now
to
sock
it
to
him
i
said
look
here
dear
friend
whats
become
of
your
high
wages
you
were
bragging
so
about
a
few
minutes
agoand
i
looked
around
on
the
company
with
placid
satisfaction
for
i
had
slipped
up
on
him
gradually
and
tied
him
hand
and
foot
you
see
without
his
ever
noticing
that
he
was
being
tied
at
all
whats
become
of
those
noble
high
wages
of
yoursi
seem
to
have
knocked
the
stuffing
all
out
of
them
it
appears
to
me
but
if
you
will
believe
me
he
merely
looked
surprised
that
is
all
he
didnt
grasp
the
situation
at
all
didnt
know
he
had
walked
into
a
trap
didnt
discover
that
he
was
in
a
trap
i
could
have
shot
him
from
sheer
vexation
with
cloudy
eye
and
a
struggling
intellect
he
fetched
this
out
marry
i
seem
not
to
understand
it
is
proved
that
our
wages
be
double
thine
how
then
may
it
be
that
thoust
knocked
therefrom
the
stuffingan
miscall
not
the
wonderly
word
this
being
the
first
time
under
grace
and
providence
of
god
it
hath
been
granted
me
to
hear
it
well
i
was
stunned
partly
with
this
unlookedfor
stupidity
on
his
part
and
partly
because
his
fellows
so
manifestly
sided
with
him
and
were
of
his
mindif
you
might
call
it
mind
my
position
was
simple
enough
plain
enough
how
could
it
ever
be
simplified
more
however
i
must
try
why
look
here
brother
dowley
dont
you
see
your
wages
are
merely
higher
than
ours
in
name
not
in
fact
hear
him
they
are
the
doubleye
have
confessed
it
yourself
yesyes
i
dont
deny
that
at
all
but
thats
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
amount
of
the
wages
in
mere
coins
with
meaningless
names
attached
to
them
to
know
them
by
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
thing
is
how
much
can
you
buy
with
your
wages
thats
the
idea
while
it
is
true
that
with
you
a
good
mechanic
is
allowed
about
three
dollars
and
a
half
a
year
and
with
us
only
about
a
dollar
and
seventyfive
thereyere
confessing
it
again
yere
confessing
it
again
confound
it
ive
never
denied
it
i
tell
you
what
i
say
is
this
with
us
half
a
dollar
buys
more
than
a
dollar
buys
with
youand
therefore
it
stands
to
reason
and
the
commonest
kind
of
commonsense
that
our
wages
are
higher
than
yours
he
looked
dazed
and
said
despairingly
verily
i
cannot
make
it
out
yeve
just
said
ours
are
the
higher
and
with
the
same
breath
ye
take
it
back
oh
great
scott
isnt
it
possible
to
get
such
a
simple
thing
through
your
head
now
look
herelet
me
illustrate
we
pay
four
cents
for
a
womans
stuff
gown
you
pay
840
which
is
four
mills
more
than
double
what
do
you
allow
a
laboring
woman
who
works
on
a
farm
two
mills
a
day
very
good
we
allow
but
half
as
much
we
pay
her
only
a
tenth
of
a
cent
a
day
and
again
yere
conf
wait
now
you
see
the
thing
is
very
simple
this
time
youll
understand
it
for
instance
it
takes
your
woman
42
days
to
earn
her
gown
at
2
mills
a
day7
weeks
work
but
ours
earns
hers
in
forty
daystwo
days
short
of
7
weeks
your
woman
has
a
gown
and
her
whole
seven
weeks
wages
are
gone
ours
has
a
gown
and
two
days
wages
left
to
buy
something
else
with
therenow
you
understand
it
he
lookedwell
he
merely
looked
dubious
its
the
most
i
can
say
so
did
the
others
i
waitedto
let
the
thing
work
dowley
spoke
at
lastand
betrayed
the
fact
that
he
actually
hadnt
gotten
away
from
his
rooted
and
grounded
superstitions
yet
he
said
with
a
trifle
of
hesitancy
butbutye
cannot
fail
to
grant
that
two
mills
a
day
is
better
than
one
shucks
well
of
course
i
hated
to
give
it
up
so
i
chanced
another
flyer
let
us
suppose
a
case
suppose
one
of
your
journeymen
goes
out
and
buys
the
following
articles
1
pound
of
salt
1
dozen
eggs
1
dozen
pints
of
beer
1
bushel
of
wheat
1
towlinen
suit
5
pounds
of
beef
5
pounds
of
mutton
the
lot
will
cost
him
32
cents
it
takes
him
32
working
days
to
earn
the
money5
weeks
and
2
days
let
him
come
to
us
and
work
32
days
at
half
the
wages
he
can
buy
all
those
things
for
a
shade
under
14
12
cents
they
will
cost
him
a
shade
under
29
days
work
and
he
will
have
about
half
a
weeks
wages
over
carry
it
through
the
year
he
would
save
nearly
a
weeks
wages
every
two
months
your
man
nothing
thus
saving
five
or
six
weeks
wages
in
a
year
your
man
not
a
cent
now
i
reckon
you
understand
that
high
wages
and
low
wages
are
phrases
that
dont
mean
anything
in
the
world
until
you
find
out
which
of
them
will
buy
the
most
it
was
a
crusher
but
alas
it
didnt
crush
no
i
had
to
give
it
up
what
those
people
valued
was
high
wages
it
didnt
seem
to
be
a
matter
of
any
consequence
to
them
whether
the
high
wages
would
buy
anything
or
not
they
stood
for
protection
and
swore
by
it
which
was
reasonable
enough
because
interested
parties
had
gulled
them
into
the
notion
that
it
was
protection
which
had
created
their
high
wages
i
proved
to
them
that
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
their
wages
had
advanced
but
30
per
cent
while
the
cost
of
living
had
gone
up
100
and
that
with
us
in
a
shorter
time
wages
had
advanced
40
per
cent
while
the
cost
of
living
had
gone
steadily
down
but
it
didnt
do
any
good
nothing
could
unseat
their
strange
beliefs
well
i
was
smarting
under
a
sense
of
defeat
undeserved
defeat
but
what
of
that
that
didnt
soften
the
smart
any
and
to
think
of
the
circumstances
the
first
statesman
of
the
age
the
capablest
man
the
bestinformed
man
in
the
entire
world
the
loftiest
uncrowned
head
that
had
moved
through
the
clouds
of
any
political
firmament
for
centuries
sitting
here
apparently
defeated
in
argument
by
an
ignorant
country
blacksmith
and
i
could
see
that
those
others
were
sorry
for
mewhich
made
me
blush
till
i
could
smell
my
whiskers
scorching
put
yourself
in
my
place
feel
as
mean
as
i
did
as
ashamed
as
i
feltwouldnt
you
have
struck
below
the
belt
to
get
even
yes
you
would
it
is
simply
human
nature
well
that
is
what
i
did
i
am
not
trying
to
justify
it
im
only
saying
that
i
was
mad
and
anybody
would
have
done
it
well
when
i
make
up
my
mind
to
hit
a
man
i
dont
plan
out
a
lovetap
no
that
isnt
my
way
as
long
as
im
going
to
hit
him
at
all
im
going
to
hit
him
a
lifter
and
i
dont
jump
at
him
all
of
a
sudden
and
risk
making
a
blundering
halfway
business
of
it
no
i
get
away
off
yonder
to
one
side
and
work
up
on
him
gradually
so
that
he
never
suspects
that
im
going
to
hit
him
at
all
and
by
and
by
all
in
a
flash
hes
flat
on
his
back
and
he
cant
tell
for
the
life
of
him
how
it
all
happened
that
is
the
way
i
went
for
brother
dowley
i
started
to
talking
lazy
and
comfortable
as
if
i
was
just
talking
to
pass
the
time
and
the
oldest
man
in
the
world
couldnt
have
taken
the
bearings
of
my
starting
place
and
guessed
where
i
was
going
to
fetch
up
boys
theres
a
good
many
curious
things
about
law
and
custom
and
usage
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
when
you
come
to
look
at
it
yes
and
about
the
drift
and
progress
of
human
opinion
and
movement
too
there
are
written
lawsthey
perish
but
there
are
also
unwritten
lawsthey
are
eternal
take
the
unwritten
law
of
wages
it
says
theyve
got
to
advance
little
by
little
straight
through
the
centuries
and
notice
how
it
works
we
know
what
wages
are
now
here
and
there
and
yonder
we
strike
an
average
and
say
thats
the
wages
of
today
we
know
what
the
wages
were
a
hundred
years
ago
and
what
they
were
two
hundred
years
ago
thats
as
far
back
as
we
can
get
but
it
suffices
to
give
us
the
law
of
progress
the
measure
and
rate
of
the
periodical
augmentation
and
so
without
a
document
to
help
us
we
can
come
pretty
close
to
determining
what
the
wages
were
three
and
four
and
five
hundred
years
ago
good
so
far
do
we
stop
there
no
we
stop
looking
backward
we
face
around
and
apply
the
law
to
the
future
my
friends
i
can
tell
you
what
peoples
wages
are
going
to
be
at
any
date
in
the
future
you
want
to
know
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
what
goodman
what
yes
in
seven
hundred
years
wages
will
have
risen
to
six
times
what
they
are
now
here
in
your

and
farm
hands
will
be
allowed
3

a
mechanics

then
be

a

there
was
a

a

muttered
marco
his

coming
quick
and
short
with
excitement
wages
will
keep
on
rising
little
by
little
little
by
little
as
steadily
as
a
tree
grows
and
at
the
end
of
three
hundred
and
forty
years
more
therell
be
at
least
one
country
where
the
mechanics
average
wage
will
be
two
hundred
cents
a
day
it
knocked
them
absolutely
dumb
not
a
man
of
them
could
get
his
breath
for
upwards
of
two
minutes
then
the
coalburner
said
prayerfully
might
i
but
live
to
see
it
it
is
the
income
of
an
earl
said
smug
an
earl
say
ye
said
dowley
ye
could
say
more
than
that
and
speak
no
lie
theres
no
earl
in
the
realm
of
bagdemagus
that
hath
an
income
like
to
that
income
of
an
earlmf
its
the
income
of
an
angel
now
then
that
is
what
is
going
to
happen
as
regards
wages
in
that
remote
day
that
man
will
earn
with
one
weeks
work
that
bill
of
goods
which
it
takes
you
upwards
of
fifty
weeks
to
earn
now
some
other
pretty
surprising
things
are
going
to
happen
too
brother
dowley
who
is
it
that
determines
every
spring
what
the
particular
wage
of
each
kind
of
mechanic
laborer
and
servant
shall
be
for
that
year
sometimes
the
courts
sometimes
the
town
council
but
most
of
all
the
magistrate
ye
may
say
in
general
terms
it
is
the
magistrate
that
fixes
the
wages
doesnt
ask
any
of
those
poor
devils
to
help
him
fix
their
wages
for
them
does
he
hm
that
were
an
idea
the
master
thats
to
pay
him
the
money
is
the
one
thats
rightly
concerned
in
that
matter
ye
will
notice
yesbut
i
thought
the
other
man
might
have
some
little
trifle
at
stake
in
it
too
and
even
his
wife
and
children
poor
creatures
the
masters
are
these
nobles
rich
men
the
prosperous
generally
these
few
who
do
no
work
determine
what
pay
the
vast
hive
shall
have
who
do
work
you
see
theyre
a
combinea
trade
union
to
coin
a
new
phrasewho
band
themselves
together
to
force
their
lowly
brother
to
take
what
they
choose
to
give
thirteen
hundred
years
henceso
says
the
unwritten
lawthe
combine
will
be
the
other
way
and
then
how
these
fine
peoples
posterity
will
fume
and
fret
and
grit
their
teeth
over
the
insolent
tyranny
of
trade
unions
yes
indeed
the
magistrate
will
tranquilly
arrange
the
wages
from
now
clear
away
down
into
the
nineteenth
century
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
wageearner
will
consider
that
a
couple
of
thousand
years
or
so
is
enough
of
this
onesided
sort
of
thing
and
he
will
rise
up
and
take
a
hand
in
fixing
his
wages
himself
ah
he
will
have
a
long
and
bitter
account
of
wrong
and
humiliation
to
settle
do
ye
believe
that
he
actually
will
help
to
fix
his
own
wages
yes
indeed
and
he
will
be

theres

a

may

one
month
at
a
time
if

a

a
whole

both

in

a

will
be

not
the

of

he

say
no
good
word

most
strange
idea

well
ill
tell
you
why
is
a
man
ever
put
in
the
pillory
for
a
capital
crime
no
is
it
right
to
condemn
a
man
to
a
slight
punishment
for
a
small
offense
and
then
kill
him
there
was
no

i
had
scored
my
first
point

the
first
time
the

wasnt
up

ready
the
company
noticed
it
good
effect
you
dont
answer
brother
you
were
about
to
glorify
the
pillory
a
while
ago
and
shed
some
pity
on
a
future
age
that
isnt
going
to
use
it
i
think
the
pillory
ought
to
be
abolished
what
usually
happens
when
a
poor
fellow
is
put
in
the
pillory
for
some
little
offense
that
didnt
amount
to
anything
in
the
world
the
mob
try
to
have
some
fun
with
him
dont
they
yes
they
begin
by
clodding
him
and
they
laugh
themselves
to
pieces
to
see
him
try
to
dodge
one
clod
and
get
hit
with
another
yes
then
they
throw
dead
cats
at
him
dont
they
yes
well
then
suppose
he
has
a
few
personal
enemies
in
that
mob
and
here
and
there
a
man
or
a
woman
with
a
secret
grudge
against
himand
suppose
especially
that
he
is
unpopular
in
the
community
for
his
pride
or
his
prosperity
or
one
thing
or
anotherstones
and
bricks

presently
dont
they
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
as
a
rule
he
is

it
is

god
knoweth
it

if
he
is
unpopular
he
can
depend
on
dying
right
there
in
the

cant
he
he
surely
can
one
may
not

i
take
it
none
of
you
are
unpopularby
reason
of
pride
or
insolence
or
conspicuous
prosperity
or
any
of
those
things
that
excite
envy
and
malice
among
the
base
scum
of
a
village
you
wouldnt
think
it
much
of
a
risk
to
take
a
chance
in
the
stocks
dowley
winced
visibly
i
judged
he
was
hit
but
he
didnt
betray
it
by
any
spoken
word
as
for
the
others
they
spoke
out
plainly
and
with
strong
feeling
they
said
they
had
seen
enough
of
the
stocks
to
know
what
a
mans
chance
in
them
was
and
they
would
never
consent
to
enter
them
if
they
could
compromise
on
a
quick
death
by
hanging
well
to
change
the
subjectfor
i
think
ive
established
my
point
that
the
stocks
ought
to
be
abolished
i
think
some
of
our
laws
are
pretty
unfair
for
instance
if
i
do
a
thing
which
ought
to
deliver
me
to
the
stocks
and
you
know
i
did
it
and
yet
keep
still
and
dont
report
me
you
will
get
the
stocks
if
anybody
informs
on
you
ah
but
that
would
serve
you
but
right
said
dowley
for
you
must
inform
so
saith
the
law
the
others
coincided
well
all
right
let
it
go
since
you
vote
me
down
but
theres
one
thing
which
certainly
isnt
fair
the
magistrate
fixes
a
mechanics
wage
at
one
cent
a
day
for
instance
the
law
says
that
if
any
master
shall
venture
even
under
utmost
press
of
business
to
pay
anything
over
that
cent
a
day
even
for
a
single
day
he
shall
be
both
fined
and
pilloried
for
it
and
whoever
knows
he
did
it
and
doesnt
inform
they
also
shall
be
fined
and
pilloried
now
it
seems
to
me
unfair
dowley
and
a
deadly
peril
to
all
of
us
that
because
you
thoughtlessly
confessed
a
while
ago
that
within
a
week
you
have
paid
a
cent
and
fifteen
mil
oh
i
tell
you
it
was
a
smasher
you
ought
to
have
seen
them
to
go
to
pieces
the
whole
gang
i
had
just
slipped
up
on
poor
smiling
and
complacent
dowley
so
nice
and
easy
and
softly
that
he
never
suspected
anything
was
going
to
happen
till
the
blow
came
crashing
down
and
knocked
him
all
to
rags
a
fine
effect
in
fact
as
fine
as
any
i
ever
produced
with
so
little
time
to
work
it
up
in
but
i
saw
in
a
moment
that
i
had
overdone
the
thing
a
little
i
was
expecting
to
scare
them
but
i
wasnt
expecting
to
scare
them
to
death
they
were
mighty
near
it
though
you
see
they
had
been
a
whole
lifetime
learning
to
appreciate
the
pillory
and
to
have
that
thing
staring
them
in
the
face
and
every
one
of
them
distinctly
at
the
mercy
of
me
a
stranger
if
i
chose
to
go
and
reportwell
it
was
awful
and
they
couldnt
seem
to
recover
from
the
shock
they
couldnt
seem
to
pull
themselves
together
pale
shaky
dumb
pitiful
why
they
werent
any
better
than
so
many
dead
men
it
was
very
uncomfortable
of
course
i
thought
they
would
appeal
to
me
to
keep
mum
and
then
we
would
shake
hands
and
take
a
drink
all
round
and
laugh
it
off
and
there
an
end
but
no
you
see
i
was
an
unknown
person
among
a
cruelly
oppressed
and
suspicious
people
a
people
always
accustomed
to
having
advantage
taken
of
their
helplessness
and
never
expecting
just
or
kind
treatment
from
any
but
their
own
families
and
very
closest
intimates
appeal
to
me
to
be
gentle
to
be
fair
to
be
generous
of
course
they
wanted
to
but
they
couldnt

so
the
gun
was
a
purse
and
very
handy
too
you
could
pay
out
money
in
the
dark
with
it
with
accuracy
and
you
could
carry
it
in
your
mouth
or
in
your
vest
pocket
if
you
had
one
i
made
them
of
several
sizes
one
size
so
large
that
it
would
carry
the
equivalent
of
a
dollar
using
shot
for
money
was
a
good
thing
for
the
government
the
metal
cost
nothing
and
the
money
couldnt
be
counterfeited
for
i
was
the
only
person
in
the
kingdom
who
knew
how
to
manage
a
shot
tower
paying
the
shot
soon
came
to
be
a
common
phrase
yes
and
i
knew
it
would
still
be
passing
mens
lips
away
down
in
the
nineteenth
century
yet
none
would
suspect
how
and
when
it
originated
the
king
joined
us
about
this
time
mightily
refreshed
by
his
nap
and
feeling
good
anything
could
make
me
nervous
now
i
was
so
uneasyfor
our
lives
were
in
danger
and
so
it
worried
me
to
detect
a
complacent
something
in
the
kings
eye
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
had
been
loading
himself
up
for
a
performance
of
some
kind
or
other
confound
it
why
must
he
go
and
choose
such
a
time
as
this
i
was
right
he
began
straight
off
in
the
most
innocently
artful
and
transparent
and
lubberly
way
to
lead
up
to
the
subject
of
agriculture
the
cold
sweat
broke
out
all
over
me
i
wanted
to
whisper
in
his
ear
man
we
are
in
awful
danger
every
moment
is
worth
a
principality
till
we
get
back
these
mens
confidence
dont
waste
any
of
this
golden
time
but
of
course
i
couldnt
do
it
whisper
to
him
it
would
look
as
if
we
were
conspiring
so
i
had
to
sit
there
and
look
calm
and
pleasant
while
the
king
stood
over
that
dynamite
mine
and
mooned
along
about
his
damned
onions
and
things
at
first
the
tumult
of
my
own
thoughts
summoned
by
the
dangersignal
and
swarming
to
the
rescue
from
every
quarter
of
my
skull
kept
up
such
a
hurrah
and
confusion
and
fifing
and
drumming
that
i
couldnt
take
in
a
word
but
presently
when
my
mob
of
gathering
plans
began
to
crystallize
and
fall
into
position
and
form
line
of
battle
a
sort
of
order
and
quiet
ensued
and
i
caught
the
boom
of
the
kings
batteries
as
if
out
of
remote
distance
were
not
the
best
way
methinks
albeit
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
authorities
differ
as
concerning
this
point
some
contending
that
the
onion
is
but
an
unwholesome
berry
when
stricken
early
from
the
tree
the
audience
showed
signs
of
life
and
sought
each
others
eyes
in
a
surprised
and
troubled
way
whileas
others
do
yet
maintain
with
much
show
of
reason
that
this
is
not
of
necessity
the
case
instancing
that
plums
and
other
like
cereals
do
be
always
dug
in
the
unripe
state
the
audience
exhibited
distinct
distress
yes
and
also
fear
yet
are
they
clearly
wholesome
the
more
especially
when
one
doth
assuage
the
asperities
of
their
nature
by
admixture
of
the
tranquilizing
juice
of
the
wayward
cabbage
the
wild
light
of
terror
began
to
glow
in
these
mens
eyes
and
one
of
them
muttered
these
be
errors
every
onegod
hath
surely
smitten
the
mind
of
this
farmer
i
was
in
miserable
apprehension
i
sat
upon
thorns
and
further
instancing
the
known
truth
that
in
the
case
of
animals
the
young
which
may
be
called
the
green
fruit
of
the
creature
is
the
better
all
confessing
that
when
a
goat
is
ripe
his
fur
doth
heat
and
sore
engame
his
flesh
the
which
defect
taken
in
connection
with
his
several
rancid
habits
and
fulsome
appetites
and
godless
attitudes
of
mind
and
bilious
quality
of
morals
they
rose
and
went
for
him
with
a
fierce
shout
the
one
would
betray
us
the
other
is
mad
kill
them
kill
them
they
flung
themselves
upon
us
what
joy
flamed
up
in
the
kings
eye
he
might
be
lame
in
agriculture
but
this
kind
of
thing
was
just
in
his
line
he
had
been
fasting
long
he
was
hungry
for
a
fight
he
hit
the
blacksmith
a
crack
under
the
jaw
that
lifted
him
clear
off
his
feet
and
stretched
him
flat
on
his
back
st
george
for
britain
and
he
downed
the
wheelwright
the
mason
was
big
but
i
laid
him
out
like
nothing
the
three
gathered
themselves
up
and
came
again
went
down
again
came
again
and
kept
on
repeating
this
with
native
british
pluck
until
they
were
battered
to
jelly
reeling
with
exhaustion
and
so
blind
that
they
couldnt
tell
us
from
each
other
and
yet
they
kept
right
on
hammering
away
with
what
might
was
left
in
them
hammering
each
otherfor
we
stepped
aside
and
looked
on
while
they
rolled
and
struggled
and
gouged
and
pounded
and
bit
with
the
strict
and
wordless
attention
to
business
of
so
many
bulldogs
we
looked
on
without
apprehension
for
they
were
fast
getting
past
ability
to
go
for
help
against
us
and
the
arena
was
far
enough
from
the
public
road
to
be
safe
from
intrusion
well
while
they
were
gradually
playing
out
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
to
wonder
what
had
become
of
marco
i
looked
around
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
oh
but
this
was
ominous
i
pulled
the
kings
sleeve
and
we
glided
away
and
rushed
for
the
hut
no
marco
there
no
phyllis
there
they
had
gone
to
the
road
for
help
sure
i
told
the
king
to
give
his
heels
wings
and
i
would
explain
later
we
made
good
time
across
the
open
ground
and
as
we
darted
into
the
shelter
of
the
wood
i
glanced
back
and
saw
a
mob
of
excited
peasants
swarm
into
view
with
marco
and
his
wife
at
their
head
they
were
making
a
world
of
noise
but
that
couldnt
hurt
anybody
the
wood
was
dense
and
as
soon
as
we
were
well
into
its
depths
we
would
take
to
a
tree
and
let
them
whistle
ah
but
then
came
another
sounddogs
yes
that
was
quite
another
matter
it
magnified
our
contractwe
must
find
running
water
we
tore
along
at
a
good
gait
and
soon
left
the
sounds
far
behind
and
modified
to
a
murmur
we
struck
a
stream
and
darted
into
it
we
waded
swiftly
down
it
in
the
dim
forest
light
for
as
much
as
three
hundred
yards
and
then
came
across
an
oak
with
a
great
bough
sticking
out
over
the
water
we
climbed
up
on
this
bough
and
began
to
work
our
way
along
it
to
the
body
of
the
tree
now
we
began
to
hear
those
sounds
more
plainly
so
the
mob
had
struck
our
trail
for
a
while
the
sounds
approached
pretty
fast
and
then
for
another
while
they
didnt
no
doubt
the
dogs
had
found
the
place
where
we
had
entered
the
stream
and
were
now
waltzing
up
and
down
the
shores
trying
to
pick
up
the
trail
again
when
we
were
snugly
lodged
in
the
tree
and
curtained
with
foliage
the
king
was
satisfied
but
i
was
doubtful
i
believed
we
could
crawl
along
a
branch
and
get
into
the
next
tree
and
i
judged
it
worth
while
to
try
we
tried
it
and
made
a
success
of
it
though
the
king
slipped
at
the
junction
and
came
near
failing
to
connect
we
got
comfortable
lodgment
and
satisfactory
concealment
among
the
foliage
and
then
we
had
nothing
to
do
but
listen
to
the
hunt
presently
we
heard
it
comingand
coming
on
the
jump
too
yes
and
down
both
sides
of
the
stream
louderloudernext
minute
it
swelled
swiftly
up
into
a
roar
of
shoutings
barkings
tramplings
and
swept
by
like
a
cyclone
i
was
afraid
that
the
overhanging
branch
would
suggest
something
to
them
said
i
but
i
dont
mind
the
disappointment
come
my
liege
it
were
well
that
we
make
good
use
of
our
time
weve
flanked
them
dark
is
coming
on
presently
if
we
can
cross
the
stream
and
get
a
good
start
and
borrow
a
couple
of
horses
from
somebodys
pasture
to
use
for
a
few
hours
we
shall
be
safe
enough
we
started
down
and
got
nearly
to
the
lowest
limb
when
we
seemed
to
hear
the
hunt
returning
we
stopped
to
listen
yes
said
i
theyre
baffled
theyve
given
it
up
theyre
on
their
way
home
we
will
climb
back
to
our
roost
again
and
let
them
go
by
so
we
climbed
back
the
king
listened
a
moment
and
said
they
still
searchi
wit
the
sign
we
did
best
to
abide
he
was
right
he
knew
more
about
hunting
than
i
did
the
noise
approached
steadily
but
not
with
a
rush
the
king
said
they
reason
that
we
were
advantaged
by
no
parlous
start
of
them
and
being
on
foot
are
as
yet
no
mighty
way
from
where
we
took
the
water
yes
sire
that
is
about
it
i
am
afraid
though
i
was
hoping
better
things
the
noise
drew
nearer
and
nearer
and
soon
the
van
was
drifting
under
us
on
both
sides
of
the
water
a
voice
called
a
halt
from
the
other
bank
and
said
an
they
were
so
minded
they
could
get
to
yon
tree
by
this
branch
that
overhangs
and
yet
not
touch
ground
ye
will
do
well
to
send
a
man
up
it
marry
that
we
will
do
i
was
obliged
to
admire
my
cuteness
in
foreseeing
this
very
thing
and
swapping
trees
to
beat
it
but
dont
you
know
there
are
some
things
that
can
beat
smartness
and
foresight
awkwardness
and
stupidity
can
the
best
swordsman
in
the
world
doesnt
need
to
fear
the
second
best
swordsman
in
the
world
no
the
person
for
him
to
be
afraid
of
is
some
ignorant
antagonist
who
has
never
had
a
sword
in
his
hand
before
he
doesnt
do
the
thing
he
ought
to
do
and
so
the
expert
isnt
prepared
for
him
he
does
the
thing
he
ought
not
to
do
and
often
it
catches
the
expert
out
and
ends
him
on
the
spot
well
how
could
i
with
all
my
gifts
make
any
valuable
preparation
against
a
nearsighted
crosseyed
puddingheaded
clown
who
would
aim
himself
at
the
wrong
tree
and
hit
the
right
one
and
that
is
what
he
did
he
went
for
the
wrong
tree
which
was
of
course
the
right
one
by
mistake
and
up
he
started
matters
were
serious
now
we
remained
still
and
awaited
developments
the
peasant
toiled
his
difficult
way
up
the
king
raised
himself
up
and
stood
he
made
a
leg
ready
and
when
the
comers
head
arrived
in
reach
of
it
there
was
a
dull
thud
and
down
went
the
man
floundering
to
the
ground
there
was
a
wild
outbreak
of
anger
below
and
the
mob
swarmed
in
from
all
around
and
there
we
were
treed
and
prisoners
another
man
started
up
the
bridging
bough
was
detected
and
a
volunteer
started
up
the
tree
that
furnished
the
bridge
the
king
ordered
me
to
play
horatius
and
keep
the
bridge
for
a
while
the
enemy
came
thick
and
fast
but
no
matter
the
head
man
of
each
procession
always
got
a
buffet
that
dislodged
him
as
soon
as
he
came
in
reach
the
kings
spirits
rose
his
joy
was
limitless
he
said
that
if
nothing
occurred
to
mar
the
prospect
we
should
have
a
beautiful
night
for
on
this
line
of
tactics
we
could
hold
the
tree
against
the
whole
countryside
however
the
mob
soon
came
to
that
conclusion
themselves
wherefore
they
called
off
the
assault
and
began
to
debate
other
plans
they
had
no
weapons
but
there
were
plenty
of
stones
and
stones
might
answer
we
had
no
objections
a
stone
might
possibly
penetrate
to
us
once
in
a
while
but
it
wasnt
very
likely
we
were
well
protected
by
boughs
and
foliage
and
were
not
visible
from
any
good
aiming
point
if
they
would
but
waste
half
an
hour
in
stonethrowing
the
dark
would
come
to
our
help
we
were
feeling
very
well
satisfied
we
could
smile
almost
laugh
but
we
didnt
which
was
just
as
well
for
we
should
have
been
interrupted
before
the
stones
had
been
raging
through
the
leaves
and
bouncing
from
the
boughs
fifteen
minutes
we
began
to
notice
a
smell
a
couple
of
sniffs
of
it
was
enough
of
an
explanation
it
was
smoke
our
game
was
up
at
last
we
recognized
that
when
smoke
invites
you
you
have
to
come
they
raised
their
pile
of
dry
brush
and
damp
weeds
higher
and
higher
and
when
they
saw
the
thick
cloud
begin
to
roll
up
and
smother
the
tree
they
broke
out
in
a
storm
of
joyclamors
i
got
enough
breath
to
say
proceed
my
liege
after
you
is
manners
the
king
gasped
follow
me
down
and
then
back
thyself
against
one
side
of
the
trunk
and
leave
me
the
other
then
will
we
fight
let
each
pile
his
dead
according
to
his
own
fashion
and
taste
then
he
descended
barking
and
coughing
and
i
followed
i
struck
the
ground
an
instant
after
him
we
sprang
to
our
appointed
places
and
began
to
give
and
take
with
all
our
might
the
powwow
and
racket
were
prodigious
it
was
a
tempest
of
riot
and
confusion
and
thickfalling
blows
suddenly
some
horsemen
tore
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
and
a
voice
shouted
holdor
ye
are
dead
men
how
good
it
sounded
the
owner
of
the
voice
bore
all
the
marks
of
a
gentleman
picturesque
and
costly
raiment
the
aspect
of
command
a
hard
countenance
with
complexion
and
features
marred
by
dissipation
the
mob
fell
humbly
back
like
so
many
spaniels
the
gentleman
inspected
us
critically
then
said
sharply
to
the
peasants
what
are
ye
doing
to
these
people
they
be
madmen
worshipful
sir
that
have
come
wandering
we
know
not
whence
and
ye
know
not
whence
do
ye
pretend
ye
know
them
not
most
honored
sir
we
speak
but
the
truth
they
are
strangers
and
unknown
to
any
in
this
region
and
they
be
the
most
violent
and
bloodthirsty
madmen
that
ever
peace
ye
know
not
what
ye
say
they
are
not
mad
who
are
ye
and
whence
are
ye
explain
we
are
but
peaceful
strangers
sir
i
said
and
traveling
upon
our
own
concerns
we
are
from
a
far
country
and
unacquainted
here
we
have
purposed
no
harm
and
yet
but
for
your
brave
interference
and
protection
these
people
would
have
killed
us
as
you
have
divined
sir
we
are
not
mad
neither
are
we
violent
or
bloodthirsty
the
gentleman
turned
to
his
retinue
and
said
calmly
lash
me
these
animals
to
their
kennels
the
mob
vanished
in
an
instant
and
after
them
plunged
the
horsemen
laying
about
them
with
their
whips
and
pitilessly
riding
down
such
as
were
witless
enough
to
keep
the
road
instead
of
taking
to
the
bush
the
shrieks
and
supplications
presently
died
away
in
the
distance
and
soon
the
horsemen
began
to
straggle
back
meantime
the
gentleman
had
been
questioning
us
more
closely
but
had
dug
no
particulars
out
of
us
we
were
lavish
of
recognition
of
the
service
he
was
doing
us
but
we
revealed
nothing
more
than
that
we
were
friendless
strangers
from
a
far
country
when
the
escort
were
all
returned
the
gentleman
said
to
one
of
his
servants
bring
the
ledhorses
and
mount
these
people
yes
my
lord
we
were
placed
toward
the
rear
among
the
servants
we
traveled
pretty
fast
and
finally
drew
rein
some
time
after
dark
at
a
roadside
inn
some
ten
or
twelve
miles
from
the
scene
of
our
troubles
my
lord
went
immediately
to
his
room
after
ordering
his
supper
and
we
saw
no
more
of
him
at
dawn
in
the
morning
we
breakfasted
and
made
ready
to
start
my
lords
chief
attendant
sauntered
forward
at
that
moment
with
indolent
grace
and
said
ye
have
said
ye
should
continue
upon
this
road
which
is
our
direction
likewise
wherefore
my
lord
the
earl
grip
hath
given
commandment
that
ye
retain
the
horses
and
ride
and
that
certain
of
us
ride
with
ye
a
twenty
mile
to
a
fair
town
that
hight
cambenet
whenso
ye
shall
be
out
of
peril
we
could
do
nothing
less
than
express
our
thanks
and
accept
the
offer
we
jogged
along
six
in
the
party
at
a
moderate
and
comfortable
gait
and
in
conversation
learned
that
my
lord
grip
was
a
very
great
personage
in
his
own
region
which
lay
a
days
journey
beyond
cambenet
we
loitered
to
such
a
degree
that
it
was
near
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
when
we
entered
the
market
square
of
the
town
we
dismounted
and
left
our
thanks
once
more
for
my
lord
and
then
approached
a
crowd
assembled
in
the
center
of
the
square
to
see
what
might
be
the
object
of
interest
it
was
the
remnant
of
that
old
peregrinating
band
of
slaves
so
they
had
been
dragging
their
chains
about
all
this
weary
time
that
poor
husband
was
gone
and
also
many
others
and
some
few
purchases
had
been
added
to
the
gang
the
king
was
not
interested
and
wanted
to
move
along
but
i
was
absorbed
and
full
of
pity
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
away
from
these
worn
and
wasted
wrecks
of
humanity
there
they
sat
grounded
upon
the
ground
silent
uncomplaining
with
bowed
heads
a
pathetic
sight
and
by
hideous
contrast
a
redundant
orator
was
making
a
speech
to
another
gathering
not
thirty
steps
away
in
fulsome
laudation
of
our
glorious
british
liberties
i
was
boiling
i
had
forgotten
i
was
a
plebeian
i
was
remembering
i
was
a
man
cost
what
it
might
i
would
mount
that
rostrum
and
click
the
king
and
i
were
handcuffed
together
our
companions
those
servants
had
done
it
my
lord
grip
stood
looking
on
the
king
burst
out
in
a
fury
and
said
what
meaneth
this
illmannered
jest
my
lord
merely
said
to
his
head
miscreant
coolly
put
up
the
slaves
and
sell
them
slaves
the
word
had
a
new
soundand
how
unspeakably
awful
the
king
lifted
his
manacles
and
brought
them
down
with
a
deadly
force
but
my
lord
was
out
of
the
way
when
they
arrived
a
dozen
of
the
rascals
servants
sprang
forward
and
in
a
moment
we
were
helpless
with
our
hands
bound
behind
us
we
so
loudly
and
so
earnestly
proclaimed
ourselves
freemen
that
we
got
the
interested
attention
of
that
libertymouthing
orator
and
his
patriotic
crowd
and
they
gathered
about
us
and
assumed
a
very
determined
attitude
the
orator
said
if
indeed
ye
are
freemen
ye
have
nought
to
fearthe
godgiven
liberties
of
britain
are
about
ye
for
your
shield
and
shelter
applause
ye
shall
soon
see
bring
forth
your
proofs
what
proofs
proof
that
ye
are
freemen
ahi
remembered
i
came
to
myself
i
said
nothing
but
the
king
stormed
out
thourt
insane
man
it
were
better
and
more
in
reason
that
this
thief
and
scoundrel
here
prove
that
we
are
not
freemen
you
see
he
knew
his
own
laws
just
as
other
people
so
often
know
the
laws
by
words
not
by
effects
they
take
a
meaning
and
get
to
be
very
vivid
when
you
come
to
apply
them
to
yourself
all
hands
shook
their
heads
and
looked
disappointed
some
turned
away
no
longer
interested
the
orator
saidand
this
time
in
the
tones
of
business
not
of
sentiment
an
ye
do
not
know
your
countrys
laws
it
were
time
ye
learned
them
ye
are
strangers
to
us
ye
will
not
deny
that
ye
may
be
freemen
we
do
not
deny
that
but
also
ye
may
be
slaves
the
law
is
clear
it
doth
not
require
the
claimant
to
prove
ye
are
slaves
it
requireth
you
to
prove
ye
are
not
i
said
dear
sir
give
us
only
time
to
send
to
astolat
or
give
us
only
time
to
send
to
the
valley
of
holiness
peace
good
man
these
are
extraordinary
requests
and
you
may
not
hope
to
have
them
granted
it
would
cost
much
time
and
would
unwarrantably
inconvenience
your
master
master
idiot
stormed
the
king
i
have
no
master
i
myself
am
the
m
silence
for
gods
sake
i
got
the
words
out
in
time
to
stop
the
king
we
were
in
trouble
enough
already
it
could
not
help
us
any
to
give
these
people
the
notion
that
we
were
lunatics
there
is
no
use
in
stringing
out
the
details
the
earl
put
us
up
and
sold
us
at
auction
this
same
infernal
law
had
existed
in
our
own
south
in
my
own
time
more
than
thirteen
hundred
years
later
and
under
it
hundreds
of
freemen
who
could
not
prove
that
they
were
freemen
had
been
sold
into
lifelong
slavery
without
the
circumstance
making
any
particular
impression
upon
me
but
the
minute
law
and
the
auction
block
came
into
my
personal
experience
a
thing
which
had
been
merely
improper
before
became
suddenly
hellish
well
thats
the
way
we
are
made
yes
we
were
sold
at
auction
like
swine
in
a
big
town
and
an
active
market
we
should
have
brought
a
good
price
but
this
place
was
utterly
stagnant
and
so
we
sold
at
a
figure
which
makes
me
ashamed
every
time
i
think
of
it
the
king
of
england
brought
seven
dollars
and
his
prime
minister
nine
whereas
the
king
was
easily
worth
twelve
dollars
and
i
as
easily
worth
fifteen
but
that
is
the
way
things
always
go
if
you
force
a
sale
on
a
dull
market
i
dont
care
what
the
property
is
you
are
going
to
make
a
poor
business
of
it
and
you
can
make
up
your
mind
to
it
if
the
earl
had
had
wit
enough
to
however
there
is
no
occasion
for
my
working
my
sympathies
up
on
his
account
let
him
go
for
the
present
i
took
his
number
so
to
speak
the
slavedealer
bought
us
both
and
hitched
us
onto
that
long
chain
of
his
and
we
constituted
the
rear
of
his
procession
we
took
up
our
line
of
march
and
passed
out
of
cambenet
at
noon
and
it
seemed
to
me
unaccountably
strange
and
odd
that
the
king
of
england
and
his
chief
minister
marching
manacled
and
fettered
and
yoked
in
a
slave
convoy
could
move
by
all
manner
of
idle
men
and
women
and
under
windows
where
sat
the
sweet
and
the
lovely
and
yet
never
attract
a
curious
eye
never
provoke
a
single
remark
dear
dear
it
only
shows
that
there
is
nothing
diviner
about
a
king
than
there
is
about
a
tramp
after
all
he
is
just
a
cheap
and
hollow
artificiality
when
you
dont
know
he
is
a
king
but
reveal
his
quality
and
dear
me
it
takes
your
very
breath
away
to
look
at
him
i
reckon
we
are
all
fools
born
so
no
doubt
chapter
xxxv
a
pitiful
incident
its
a
world
of
surprises
the
king
brooded
this
was
natural
what
would
he
brood
about
should
you
say
why
about
the
prodigious
nature
of
his
fall
of
coursefrom
the
loftiest
place
in
the
world
to
the
lowest
from
the
most
illustrious
station
in
the
world
to
the
obscurest
from
the
grandest
vocation
among
men
to
the
basest
no
i
take
my
oath
that
the
thing
that
graveled
him
most
to
start
with
was
not
this
but
the
price
he
had
fetched
he
couldnt
seem
to
get
over
that
seven
dollars
well
it
stunned
me
so
when
i
first
found
it
out
that
i
couldnt
believe
it
it
didnt
seem
natural
but
as
soon
as
my
mental
sight
cleared
and
i
got
a
right
focus
on
it
i
saw
i
was
mistaken
it
was
natural
for
this
reason
a
king
is
a
mere
artificiality
and
so
a
kings
feelings
like
the
impulses
of
an
automatic
doll
are
mere
artificialities
but
as
a
man
he
is
a
reality
and
his
feelings
as
a
man
are
real
not
phantoms
it
shames
the
average
man
to
be
valued
below
his
own
estimate
of
his
worth
and
the
king
certainly
wasnt
anything
more
than
an
average
man
if
he
was
up
that
high
confound
him
he
wearied
me
with
arguments
to
show
that
in
anything
like
a
fair
market
he
would
have
fetched
twentyfive
dollars
surea
thing
which
was
plainly
nonsense
and
full
or
the
baldest
conceit
i
wasnt
worth
it
myself
but
it
was
tender
ground
for
me
to
argue
on
in
fact
i
had
to
simply
shirk
argument
and
do
the
diplomatic
instead
i
had
to
throw
conscience
aside
and
brazenly
concede
that
he
ought
to
have
brought
twentyfive
dollars
whereas
i
was
quite
well
aware
that
in
all
the
ages
the
world
had
never
seen
a
king
that
was
worth
half
the
money
and
during
the
next
thirteen
centuries
wouldnt
see
one
that
was
worth
the
fourth
of
it
yes
he
tired
me
if
he
began
to
talk
about
the
crops
or
about
the
recent
weather
or
about
the
condition
of
politics
or
about
dogs
or
cats
or
morals
or
theologyno
matter
what
i
sighed
for
i
knew
what
was
coming
he
was
going
to
get
out
of
it
a
palliation
of
that
tiresome
sevendollar
sale
wherever
we
halted
where
there
was
a
crowd
he
would
give
me
a
look
which
said
plainly
if
that
thing
could
be
tried
over
again
now
with
this
kind
of
folk
you
would
see
a
different
result
well
when
he
was
first
sold
it
secretly
tickled
me
to
see
him
go
for
seven
dollars
but
before
he
was
done
with
his
sweating
and
worrying
i
wished
he
had
fetched
a
hundred
the
thing
never
got
a
chance
to
die
for
every
day
at
one
place
or
another
possible
purchasers
looked
us
over
and
as
often
as
any
other
way
their
comment
on
the
king
was
something
like
this
heres
a
twodollarandahalf
chump
with
a
thirtydollar
style
pity
but
style
was
marketable
at
last
this
sort
of
remark
produced
an
evil
result
our
owner
was
a
practical
person
and
he
perceived
that
this
defect
must
be
mended
if
he
hoped
to
find
a
purchaser
for
the
king
so
he
went
to
work
to
take
the
style
out
of
his
sacred
majesty
i
could
have
given
the
man
some
valuable
advice
but
i
didnt
you
mustnt
volunteer
advice
to
a
slavedriver
unless
you
want
to
damage
the
cause
you
are
arguing
for
i
had
found
it
a
sufficiently
difficult
job
to
reduce
the
kings
style
to
a
peasants
style
even
when
he
was
a
willing
and
anxious
pupil
now
then
to
undertake
to
reduce
the
kings
style
to
a
slaves
styleand
by
forcego
to
it
was
a
stately
contract
never
mind
the
detailsit
will
save
me
trouble
to
let
you
imagine
them
i
will
only
remark
that
at
the
end
of
a
week
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
that
lash
and
club
and
fist
had
done
their
work
well
the
kings
body
was
a
sight
to
seeand
to
weep
over
but
his
spiritwhy
it
wasnt
even
phased
even
that
dull
clod
of
a
slavedriver
was
able
to
see
that
there
can
be
such
a
thing
as
a
slave
who
will
remain
a
man
till
he
dies
whose
bones
you
can
break
but
whose
manhood
you
cant
this
man
found
that
from
his
first
effort
down
to
his
latest
he
couldnt
ever
come
within
reach
of
the
king
but
the
king
was
ready
to
plunge
for
him
and
did
it
so
he
gave
up
at
last
and
left
the
king
in
possession
of
his
style
unimpaired
the
fact
is
the
king
was
a
good
deal
more
than
a
king
he
was
a
man
and
when
a
man
is
a
man
you
cant
knock
it
out
of
him
we
had
a
rough
time
for
a
month
tramping
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
and
suffering
and
what
englishman
was
the
most
interested
in
the
slavery
question
by
that
time
his
grace
the
king
yes
from
being
the
most
indifferent
he
was
become
the
most
interested
he
was
become
the
bitterest
hater
of
the
institution
i
had
ever
heard
talk
and
so
i
ventured
to
ask
once
more
a
question
which
i
had
asked
years
before
and
had
gotten
such
a
sharp
answer
that
i
had
not
thought
it
prudent
to
meddle
in
the
matter
further
would
he
abolish
slavery
his
answer
was
as
sharp
as
before
but
it
was
music
this
time
i
shouldnt
ever
wish
to
hear
pleasanter
though
the
profanity
was
not
good
being
awkwardly
put
together
and
with
the
crashword
almost
in
the
middle
instead
of
at
the
end
where
of
course
it
ought
to
have
been
i
was
ready
and
willing
to
get
free
now
i
hadnt
wanted
to
get
free
any
sooner
no
i
cannot
quite
say
that
i
had
wanted
to
but
i
had
not
been
willing
to
take
desperate
chances
and
had
always
dissuaded
the
king
from
them
but
nowah
it
was
a
new
atmosphere
liberty
would
be
worth
any
cost
that
might
be
put
upon
it
now
i
set
about
a
plan
and
was
straightway
charmed
with
it
it
would
require
time
yes
and
patience
too
a
great
deal
of
both
one
could
invent
quicker
ways
and
fully
as
sure
ones
but
none
that
would
be
as
picturesque
as
this
none
that
could
be
made
so
dramatic
and
so
i
was
not
going
to
give
this
one
up
it
might
delay
us
months
but
no
matter
i
would
carry
it
out
or
break
something
now
and
then
we
had
an
adventure
one
night
we
were
overtaken
by
a
snowstorm
while
still
a
mile
from
the
village
we
were
making
for
almost
instantly
we
were
shut
up
as
in
a
fog
the
driving
snow
was
so
thick
you
couldnt
see
a
thing
and
we
were
soon
lost
the
slavedriver
lashed
us
desperately
for
he
saw
ruin
before
him
but
his
lashings
only
made
matters
worse
for
they
drove
us
further
from
the
road
and
from
likelihood
of
succor
so
we
had
to
stop
at
last
and
slump
down
in
the
snow
where
we
were
the
storm
continued
until
toward
midnight
then
ceased
by
this
time
two
of
our
feebler
men
and
three
of
our
women
were
dead
and
others
past
moving
and
threatened
with
death
our
master
was
nearly
beside
himself
he
stirred
up
the
living
and
made
us
stand
jump
slap
ourselves
to
restore
our
circulation
and
he
helped
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
whip
now
came
a
diversion
we
heard
shrieks
and
yells
and
soon
a
woman
came
running
and
crying
and
seeing
our
group
she
flung
herself
into
our
midst
and
begged
for
protection
a
mob
of
people
came
tearing
after
her
some
with
torches
and
they
said
she
was
a
witch
who
had
caused
several
cows
to
die
by
a
strange
disease
and
practiced
her
arts
by
help
of
a
devil
in
the
form
of
a
black
cat
this
poor
woman
had
been
stoned
until
she
hardly
looked
human
she
was
so
battered
and
bloody
the
mob
wanted
to
burn
her
well
now
what
do
you
suppose
our
master
did
when
we
closed
around
this
poor
creature
to
shelter
her
he
saw
his
chance
he
said
burn
her
here
or
they
shouldnt
have
her
at
all
imagine
that
they
were
willing
they
fastened
her
to
a
post
they
brought
wood
and
piled
it
about
her
they
applied
the
torch
while
she
shrieked
and
pleaded
and
strained
her
two
young
daughters
to
her
breast
and
our
brute
with
a
heart
solely
for
business
lashed
us
into
position
about
the
stake
and
warmed
us
into
life
and
commercial
value
by
the
same
fire
which
took
away
the
innocent
life
of
that
poor
harmless
mother
that
was
the
sort
of
master
we
had
i
took
his
number
that
snowstorm
cost
him
nine
of
his
flock
and
he
was
more
brutal
to
us
than
ever
after
that
for
many
days
together
he
was
so
enraged
over
his
loss
we
had
adventures
all
along
one
day
we
ran
into
a
procession
and
such
a
procession
all
the
riffraff
of
the
kingdom
seemed
to
be
comprehended
in
it
and
all
drunk
at
that
in
the
van
was
a
cart
with
a
coffin
in
it
and
on
the
coffin
sat
a
comely
young
girl
of
about
eighteen
suckling
a
baby
which
she
squeezed
to
her
breast
in
a
passion
of
love
every
little
while
and
every
little
while
wiped
from
its
face
the
tears
which
her
eyes
rained
down
upon
it
and
always
the
foolish
little
thing
smiled
up
at
her
happy
and
content
kneading
her
breast
with
its
dimpled
fat
hand
which
she
patted
and
fondled
right
over
her
breaking
heart
men
and
women
boys
and
girls
trotted
along
beside
or
after
the
cart
hooting
shouting
profane
and
ribald
remarks
singing
snatches
of
foul
song
skipping
dancinga
very
holiday
of
hellions
a
sickening
sight
we
had
struck
a
suburb
of
london
outside
the
walls
and
this
was
a
sample
of
one
sort
of
london
society
our
master
secured
a
good
place
for
us
near
the
gallows
a
priest
was
in
attendance
and
he
helped
the
girl
climb
up
and
said
comforting
words
to
her
and
made
the
undersheriff
provide
a
stool
for
her
then
he
stood
there
by
her
on
the
gallows
and
for
a
moment
looked
down
upon
the
mass
of
upturned
faces
at
his
feet
then
out
over
the
solid
pavement
of
heads
that
stretched
away
on
every
side
occupying
the
vacancies
far
and
near
and
then
began
to
tell
the
story
of
the
case
and
there
was
pity
in
his
voice
how
seldom
a
sound
that
was
in
that
ignorant
and
savage
land
i
remember
every
detail
of
what
he
said
except
the
words
he
said
it
in
and
so
i
change
it
into
my
own
words
law
is
intended
to
mete
out
justice
sometimes
it
fails
this
cannot
be
helped
we
can
only
grieve
and
be
resigned
and
pray
for
the
soul
of
him
who
falls
unfairly
by
the
arm
of
the
law
and
that
his
fellows
may
be
few
a
law
sends
this
poor
young
thing
to
deathand
it
is
right
but
another
law
had
placed
her
where
she
must
commit
her
crime
or
starve
with
her
childand
before
god
that
law
is
responsible
for
both
her
crime
and
her
ignominious
death
a
little
while
ago
this
young
thing
this
child
of
eighteen
years
was
as
happy
a
wife
and
mother
as
any
in
england
and
her
lips
were
blithe
with
song
which
is
the
native
speech
of
glad
and
innocent
hearts
her
young
husband
was
as
happy
as
she
for
he
was
doing
his
whole
duty
he
worked
early
and
late
at
his
handicraft
his
bread
was
honest
bread
well
and
fairly
earned
he
was
prospering
he
was
furnishing
shelter
and
sustenance
to
his
family
he
was
adding
his
mite
to
the
wealth
of
the
nation
by
consent
of
a
treacherous
law
instant
destruction
fell
upon
this
holy
home
and
swept
it
away
that
young
husband
was
waylaid
and
impressed
and
sent
to
sea
the
wife
knew
nothing
of
it
she
sought
him
everywhere
she
moved
the
hardest
hearts
with
the
supplications
of
her
tears
the
broken
eloquence
of
her
despair
weeks
dragged
by
she
watching
waiting
hoping
her
mind
going
slowly
to
wreck
under
the
burden
of
her
misery
little
by
little
all
her
small
possessions
went
for
food
when
she
could
no
longer
pay
her
rent
they
turned
her
out
of
doors
she
begged
while
she
had
strength
when
she
was
starving
at
last
and
her
milk
failing
she
stole
a
piece
of
linen
cloth
of
the
value
of
a
fourth
part
of
a
cent
thinking
to
sell
it
and
save
her
child
but
she
was
seen
by
the
owner
of
the
cloth
she
was
put
in
jail
and
brought
to
trial
the
man
testified
to
the
facts
a
plea
was
made
for
her
and
her
sorrowful
story
was
told
in
her
behalf
she
spoke
too
by
permission
and
said
she
did
steal
the
cloth
but
that
her
mind
was
so
disordered
of
late
by
trouble
that
when
she
was
overborne
with
hunger
all
acts
criminal
or
other
swam
meaningless
through
her
brain
and
she
knew
nothing
rightly
except
that
she
was
so
hungry
for
a
moment
all
were
touched
and
there
was
disposition
to
deal
mercifully
with
her
seeing
that
she
was
so
young
and
friendless
and
her
case
so
piteous
and
the
law
that
robbed
her
of
her
support
to
blame
as
being
the
first
and
only
cause
of
her
transgression
but
the
prosecuting
officer
replied
that
whereas
these
things
were
all
true
and
most
pitiful
as
well
still
there
was
much
small
theft
in
these
days
and
mistimed
mercy
here
would
be
a
danger
to
propertyoh
my
god
is
there
no
property
in
ruined
homes
and
orphaned
babes
and
broken
hearts
that
british
law
holds
preciousand
so
he
must
require
sentence
when
the
judge
put
on
his
black
cap
the
owner
of
the
stolen
linen
rose
trembling
up
his
lip
quivering
his
face
as
gray
as
ashes
and
when
the
awful
words
came
he
cried
out
oh
poor
child
poor
child
i
did
not
know
it
was
death
and
fell
as
a
tree
falls
when
they
lifted
him
up
his
reason
was
gone
before
the
sun
was
set
he
had
taken
his
own
life
a
kindly
man
a
man
whose
heart
was
right
at
bottom
add
his
murder
to
this
that
is
to
be
now
done
here
and
charge
them
both
where
they
belong
to
the
rulers
and
the
bitter
laws
of
britain
the
time
is
come
my
child
let
me
pray
over
theenot
for
thee
dear
abused
poor
heart
and
innocent
but
for
them
that
be
guilty
of
thy
ruin
and
death
who
need
it
more
after
his
prayer
they
put
the
noose
around
the
young
girls
neck
and
they
had
great
trouble
to
adjust
the
knot
under
her
ear
because
she
was
devouring
the
baby
all
the
time
wildly
kissing
it
and
snatching
it
to
her
face
and
her
breast
and
drenching
it
with
tears
and
half
moaning
half
shrieking
all
the
while
and
the
baby
crowing
and
laughing
and
kicking
its
feet
with
delight
over
what
it
took
for
romp
and
play
even
the
hangman
couldnt
stand
it
but
turned
away
when
all
was
ready
the
priest
gently
pulled
and
tugged
and
forced
the
child
out
of
the
mothers
arms
and
stepped
quickly
out
of
her
reach
but
she
clasped
her
hands
and
made
a
wild
spring
toward
him
with
a
shriek
but
the
ropeand
the
undersheriffheld
her
short
then
she
went
on
her
knees
and
stretched
out
her
hands
and
cried
one
more

is

she
almost
smothered
the
little
thing
and
when
they
got
it
away
again
she
cried
out

an
encounter
in
the
dark
londonto
a
slavewas
a
sufficiently
interesting
place
it
was
merely
a
great
big
village
and
mainly
mud
and
thatch
the
streets
were
muddy
crooked
unpaved
the
populace
was
an
ever
flocking
and
drifting
swarm
of
rags
and
splendors
of
nodding
plumes
and
shining
armor
the
king
had
a
palace
there
he
saw
the
outside
of
it
it
made
him
sigh
yes
and
swear
a
little
in
a
poor
juvenile
sixth
century
way
we
saw
knights
and
grandees
whom
we
knew
but
they
didnt
know
us
in
our
rags
and
dirt
and
raw
welts
and
bruises
and
wouldnt
have
recognized
us
if
we
had
hailed
them
nor
stopped
to
answer
either
it
being
unlawful
to
speak
with
slaves
on
a
chain
sandy
passed
within
ten
yards
of
me
on
a
mulehunting
for
me
i
imagined
but
the
thing
which
clean
broke
my
heart
was
something
which
happened
in
front
of
our
old
barrack
in
a
square
while
we
were
enduring
the
spectacle
of
a
man
being
boiled
to
death
in
oil
for
counterfeiting
pennies
it
was
the
sight
of
a
newsboyand
i
couldnt
get
at
him
still
i
had
one
comforthere
was
proof
that
clarence
was
still
alive
and
banging
away
i
meant
to
be
with
him
before
long
the
thought
was
full
of
cheer
i
had
one
little
glimpse
of
another
thing
one
day
which
gave
me
a
great
uplift
it
was
a
wire
stretching
from
housetop
to
housetop
telegraph
or
telephone
sure
i
did
very
much
wish
i
had
a
little
piece
of
it
it
was
just
what
i
needed
in
order
to
carry
out
my
project
of
escape
my
idea
was
to
get
loose
some
night
along
with
the
king
then
gag
and
bind
our
master
change
clothes
with
him
batter
him
into
the
aspect
of
a
stranger
hitch
him
to
the
slavechain
assume
possession
of
the
property
march
to
camelot
and
but
you
get
my
idea
you
see
what
a
stunning
dramatic
surprise
i
would
wind
up
with
at
the
palace
it
was
all
feasible
if
i
could
only
get
hold
of
a
slender
piece
of
iron
which
i
could
shape
into
a
lockpick
i
could
then
undo
the
lumbering
padlocks
with
which
our
chains
were
fastened
whenever
i
might
choose
but
i
never
had
any
luck
no
such
thing
ever
happened
to
fall
in
my
way
however
my
chance
came
at
last
a
gentleman
who
had
come
twice
before
to
dicker
for
me
without
result
or
indeed
any
approach
to
a
result
came
again
i
was
far
from
expecting
ever
to
belong
to
him
for
the
price
asked
for
me
from
the
time
i
was
first
enslaved
was
exorbitant
and
always
provoked
either
anger
or
derision
yet
my
master
stuck
stubbornly
to
ittwentytwo
dollars
he
wouldnt
bate
a
cent
the
king
was
greatly
admired
because
of
his
grand
physique
but
his
kingly
style
was
against
him
and
he
wasnt
salable
nobody
wanted
that
kind
of
a
slave
i
considered
myself
safe
from
parting
from
him
because
of
my
extravagant
price
no
i
was
not
expecting
to
ever
belong
to
this
gentleman
whom
i
have
spoken
of
but
he
had
something
which
i
expected
would
belong
to
me
eventually
if
he
would
but
visit
us
often
enough
it
was
a
steel
thing
with
a
long
pin
to
it
with
which
his
long
cloth
outside
garment
was
fastened
together
in
front
there
were
three
of
them
he
had
disappointed
me
twice
because
he
did
not
come
quite
close
enough
to
me
to
make
my
project
entirely
safe
but
this
time
i
succeeded
i
captured
the
lower
clasp
of
the
three
and
when
he
missed
it
he
thought
he
had
lost
it
on
the
way
i
had
a
chance
to
be
glad
about
a
minute
then
straightway
a
chance
to
be
sad
again
for
when
the
purchase
was
about
to
fail
as
usual
the
master
suddenly
spoke
up
and
said
what
would
be
worded
thus
in
modern
english
ill
tell
you
what
ill
do
im
tired
supporting
these
two
for
no
good
give
me
twentytwo
dollars
for
this
one
and
ill
throw
the
other
one
in
the
king
couldnt
get
his
breath
he
was
in
such
a
fury
he
began
to
choke
and
gag
and
meantime
the
master
and
the
gentleman
moved
away
discussing
an
ye
will
keep
the
offer
open
tis
open
till
the
morrow
at
this
hour
then
i
will
answer
you
at
that
time
said
the
gentleman
and
disappeared
the
master
following
him
i
had
a
time
of
it
to
cool
the
king
down
but
i
managed
it
i
whispered
in
his
ear
to
this
effect
your
grace
will
go
for
nothing
but
after
another
fashion
and
so
shall
i
tonight
we
shall
both
be
free
ah
how
is
that
with
this
thing
which
i
have
stolen
i
will
unlock
these
locks
and
cast
off
these
chains
tonight
when
he
comes
about
ninethirty
to
inspect
us
for
the
night
we
will
seize
him
gag
him
batter
him
and
early
in
the
morning
we
will
march
out
of
this
town
proprietors
of
this
caravan
of
slaves
that
was
as
far
as
i
went
but
the
king
was
charmed
and
satisfied
that
evening
we
waited
patiently
for
our
fellowslaves
to
get
to
sleep
and
signify
it
by
the
usual
sign
for
you
must
not
take
many
chances
on
those
poor
fellows
if
you
can
avoid
it
it
is
best
to
keep
your
own
secrets
no
doubt
they
fidgeted
only
about
as
usual
but
it
didnt
seem
so
to
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
were
going
to
be
forever
getting
down
to
their
regular
snoring
as
the
time
dragged
on
i
got
nervously
afraid
we
shouldnt
have
enough
of
it
left
for
our
needs
so
i
made
several
premature
attempts
and
merely
delayed
things
by
it
for
i
couldnt
seem
to
touch
a
padlock
there
in
the
dark
without
starting
a
rattle
out
of
it
which
interrupted
somebodys
sleep
and
made
him
turn
over
and
wake
some
more
of
the
gang
but
finally
i
did
get
my
last
iron
off
and
was
a
free
man
once
more
i
took
a
good
breath
of
relief
and
reached
for
the
kings
irons
too
late
in
comes
the
master
with
a
light
in
one
hand
and
his
heavy
walkingstaff
in
the
other
i
snuggled
close
among
the
wallow
of
snorers
to
conceal
as
nearly
as
possible
that
i
was
naked
of
irons
and
i
kept
a
sharp
lookout
and
prepared
to
spring
for
my
man
the
moment
he
should
bend
over
me
but
he
didnt
approach
he
stopped
gazed
absently
toward
our
dusky
mass
a
minute
evidently
thinking
about
something
else
then
set
down
his
light
moved
musingly
toward
the
door
and
before
a
body
could
imagine
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
was
out
of
the
door
and
had
closed
it
behind
him
quick
said
the
king
fetch
him
back
of
course
it
was
the
thing
to
do
and
i
was
up
and
out
in
a
moment
but
dear
me
there
were
no
lamps
in
those
days
and
it
was
a
dark
night
but
i
glimpsed
a
dim
figure
a
few
steps
away
i
darted
for
it
threw
myself
upon
it
and
then
there
was
a
state
of
things
and
lively
we
fought
and
scuffled
and
struggled
and
drew
a
crowd
in
no
time
they
took
an
immense
interest
in
the
fight
and
encouraged
us
all
they
could
and
in
fact
couldnt
have
been
pleasanter
or
more
cordial
if
it
had
been
their
own
fight
then
a
tremendous
row
broke
out
behind
us
and
as
much
as
half
of
our
audience
left
us
with
a
rush
to
invest
some
sympathy
in
that
lanterns
began
to
swing
in
all
directions
it
was
the
watch
gathering
from
far
and
near
presently
a
halberd
fell
across
my
back
as
a
reminder
and
i
knew
what
it
meant
i
was
in
custody
so
was
my
adversary
we
were
marched
off
toward
prison

on
each
side
of
the
watchman
here
was
disaster
here
was
a
fine
scheme
gone
to
sudden
destruction
i
tried
to
imagine
what
would
happen
when
the
master
should
discover
that
it
was
i
who
had
been
fighting
him
and
what
would
happen
if
they
jailed
us
together
in
the
general
apartment
for
brawlers
and
petty
lawbreakers
as
was
the
custom
and
what
might
just
then
my
antagonist
turned
his
face
around
in
my
direction
the
freckled
light
from
the
watchmans
tin
lantern
fell
on
it

an
awful
predicament
sleep
it
was
impossible
it
would
naturally
have
been
impossible
in
that
noisome
cavern
of
a
jail
with
its
mangy
crowd
of
drunken
quarrelsome
and
songsinging
rapscallions
but
the
thing
that
made
sleep
all
the
more
a
thing
not
to
be
dreamed
of
was
my
racking
impatience
to
get
out
of
this
place
and
find
out
the
whole
size
of
what
might
have
happened
yonder
in
the
slavequarters
in
consequence
of
that
intolerable
miscarriage
of
mine
it
was
a
long
night
but
the
morning
got
around
at
last
i
made
a
full
and
frank
explanation
to
the
court
i
said
i
was
a
slave
the
property
of
the
great
earl
grip
who
had
arrived
just
after
dark
at
the
tabard
inn
in
the
village
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
and
had
stopped
there
over
night
by
compulsion
he
being
taken
deadly
sick
with
a
strange
and
sudden
disorder
i
had
been
ordered
to
cross
to
the
city
in
all
haste
and
bring
the
best
physician
i
was
doing
my
best
naturally
i
was
running
with
all
my
might
the
night
was
dark
i
ran
against
this
common
person
here
who
seized
me
by
the
throat
and
began
to
pummel
me
although
i
told
him
my
errand
and
implored
him
for
the
sake
of
the
great
earl
my
masters
mortal
peril
the
common
person
interrupted
and
said
it
was
a
lie
and
was
going
to
explain
how
i
rushed
upon
him
and
attacked
him
without
a
word
silence
sirrah
from
the
court
take
him
hence
and
give
him
a
few
stripes
whereby
to
teach
him
how
to
treat
the
servant
of
a
nobleman
after
a
different
fashion
another
time
go
then
the
court
begged
my
pardon
and
hoped
i
would
not
fail
to
tell
his
lordship
it
was
in
no
wise
the
courts
fault
that
this
highhanded
thing
had
happened
i
said
i
would
make
it
all
right
and
so
took
my
leave
took
it
just
in
time
too
he
was
starting
to
ask
me
why
i
didnt
fetch
out
these
facts
the
moment
i
was
arrested
i
said
i
would
if
i
had
thought
of
itwhich
was
true
but
that
i
was
so
battered
by
that
man
that
all
my
wit
was
knocked
out
of
meand
so
forth
and
so
on
and
got
myself
away
still
mumbling
i
didnt
wait
for
breakfast
no
grass
grew
under
my
feet
i
was
soon
at
the
slave
quarters
emptyeverybody
gone
that
is
everybody
except
one
bodythe
slavemasters
it
lay
there
all
battered
to
pulp
and
all
about
were
the
evidences
of
a
terrific
fight
there
was
a
rude
board
coffin
on
a
cart
at
the
door
and
workmen
assisted
by
the
police
were
thinning
a
road
through
the
gaping
crowd
in
order
that
they
might
bring
it
in
i
picked
out
a
man
humble
enough
in
life
to
condescend
to
talk
with
one
so
shabby
as
i
and
got
his
account
of
the
matter
there
were
sixteen
slaves
here
they
rose
against
their
master
in
the
night
and
thou
seest
how
it
ended
yes
how
did
it
begin
there
was
no
witness
but
the
slaves
they
said
the
slave
that
was
most
valuable
got
free
of
his
bonds
and
escaped
in
some
strange
wayby
magic
arts
twas
thought
by
reason
that
he
had
no
key
and
the
locks
were
neither
broke
nor
in
any
wise
injured
when
the
master
discovered
his
loss
he
was
mad
with
despair
and
threw
himself
upon
his
people
with
his
heavy
stick
who
resisted
and
brake
his
back
and
in
other
and
divers
ways
did
give
him
hurts
that
brought
him
swiftly
to
his
end
this
is
dreadful
it
will
go
hard
with
the
slaves
no
doubt
upon
the
trial
marry
the
trial
is
over
over
would
they
be
a
week
think
youand
the
matter
so
simple
they
were
not
the
half
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
it
why
i
dont
see
how
they
could
determine
which
were
the
guilty
ones
in
so
short
a
time
which
ones
indeed
they
considered
not
particulars
like
to
that
they
condemned
them
in
a
body
wit
ye
not
the
lawwhich
men
say
the
romans
left
behind
them
here
when
they
wentthat
if
one
slave
killeth
his
master
all
the
slaves
of
that
man
must
die
for
it
true
i
had
forgotten
and
when
will
these
die
belike
within
a
four
and
twenty
hours
albeit
some
say
they
will
wait
a
pair
of
days
more
if
peradventure
they
may
find
the
missing
one
meantime
the
missing
one
it
made
me
feel
uncomfortable
is
it
likely
they
will
find
him
before
the
day
is
spentyes
they
seek
him
everywhere
they
stand
at
the
gates
of
the
town
with
certain
of
the
slaves
who
will
discover
him
to
them
if
he
cometh
and
none
can
pass
out
but
he
will
be
first
examined
might
one
see
the
place
where
the
rest
are
confined
the
outside
of
ityes
the
inside
of
itbut
ye
will
not
want
to
see
that
i
took
the
address
of
that
prison
for
future
reference
and
then
sauntered
off
at
the
first
secondhand
clothing
shop
i
came
to
up
a
back
street
i
got
a
rough
rig
suitable
for
a
common
seaman
who
might
be
going
on
a
cold
voyage
and
bound
up
my
face
with
a
liberal
bandage
saying
i
had
a
toothache
this
concealed
my
worst
bruises
it
was
a
transformation
i
no
longer
resembled
my
former
self
then
i
struck
out
for
that
wire
found
it
and
followed
it
to
its
den
it
was
a
little
room
over
a
butchers
shopwhich
meant
that
business
wasnt
very
brisk
in
the
telegraphic
line
the
young
chap
in
charge
was
drowsing
at
his
table
i
locked
the
door
and
put
the
vast
key
in
my
bosom
this
alarmed
the
young
fellow
and
he
was
going
to
make
a
noise
but
i
said
save
your
wind
if
you
open
your
mouth
you
are
dead
sure
tackle
your
instrument
lively
now
call
camelot
this
doth
amaze
me
how
should
such
as
you
know
aught
of
such
matters
as
call
camelot
i
am
a
desperate
man
call
camelot
or
get
away
from
the
instrument
and
i
will
do
it
myself
whatyou
yescertainly
stop
gabbling
call
the
palace
he
made
the
call
now
then
call
clarence
clarence
who
never
mind
clarence
who
say
you
want
clarence
youll
get
an
answer
he
did
so
we
waited
five
nervestraining
minutesten
minutes
how
long
it
did
seemand
then
came
a
click
that
was
as
familiar
to
me
as
a
human
voice
for
clarence
had
been
my
own
pupil
now
my
lad
vacate
they
would
have
known
my
touch
maybe
and
so
your
call
was
surest
but
im
all
right
now
he
vacated
the
place
and
cocked
his
ear
to
listenbut
it
didnt
win
i
used
a
cipher
i
didnt
waste
any
time
in
sociabilities
with
clarence
but
squared
away
for
business
straightoffthus
the
king
is
here
and
in
danger
we
were
captured
and
brought
here
as
slaves
we
should
not
be
able
to
prove
our
identity
and
the
fact
is
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
try
send
a
telegram
for
the
palace
here
which
will
carry
conviction
with
it
his
answer
came
straight
back
they
dont
know
anything
about
the
telegraph
they
havent
had
any
experience
yet
the
line
to
london
is
so
new
better
not
venture
that
they
might
hang
you
think
up
something
else
might
hang
us
little
he
knew
how
closely
he
was
crowding
the
facts
i
couldnt
think
up
anything
for
the
moment
then
an
idea
struck
me
and
i
started
it
along
send
five
hundred
picked
knights
with
launcelot
in
the
lead
and
send
them
on
the
jump
let
them
enter
by
the
southwest
gate
and
look
out
for
the
man
with
a
white
cloth
around
his
right
arm
the
answer
was
prompt
they
shall
start
in
half
an
hour
all
right
clarence
now
tell
this
lad
here
that
im
a
friend
of
yours
and
a
deadhead
and
that
he
must
be
discreet
and
say
nothing
about
this
visit
of
mine
the
instrument
began
to
talk
to
the
youth
and
i
hurried
away
i
fell
to
ciphering
in
half
an
hour
it
would
be
nine
oclock
knights
and
horses
in
heavy
armor
couldnt
travel
very
fast
these
would
make
the
best
time
they
could
and
now
that
the
ground
was
in
good
condition
and
no
snow
or
mud
they
would
probably
make
a
sevenmile
gait
they
would
have
to
change
horses
a
couple
of
times
they
would
arrive
about
six
or
a
little
after
it
would
still
be
plenty
light
enough
they
would
see
the
white
cloth
which
i
should
tie
around
my
right
arm
and
i
would
take
command
we
would
surround
that
prison
and
have
the
king
out
in
no
time
it
would
be
showy
and
picturesque
enough
all
things
considered
though
i
would
have
preferred
noonday
on
account
of
the
more
theatrical
aspect
the
thing
would
have
now
then
in
order
to
increase
the
strings
to
my
bow
i
thought
i
would
look
up
some
of
those
people
whom
i
had
formerly
recognized
and
make
myself
known
that
would
help
us
out
of
our
scrape
without
the
knights
but
i
must
proceed
cautiously
for
it
was
a
risky
business
i
must
get
into
sumptuous
raiment
and
it
wouldnt
do
to
run
and
jump
into
it
no
i
must
work
up
to
it
by
degrees
buying
suit
after
suit
of
clothes
in
shops
wide
apart
and
getting
a
little
finer
article
with
each
change
until
i
should
finally
reach
silk
and
velvet
and
be
ready
for
my
project
so
i
started
but
the
scheme
fell
through
like
scat
the
first
corner
i
turned
i
came
plump
upon
one
of
our
slaves
snooping
around
with
a
watchman
i
coughed
at
the
moment
and
he
gave
me
a
sudden
look
that
bit
right
into
my
marrow
i
judge
he
thought
he
had
heard
that
cough
before
i
turned
immediately
into
a
shop
and
worked
along
down
the
counter
pricing
things
and
watching
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
those
people
had
stopped
and
were
talking
together
and
looking
in
at
the
door
i
made
up
my
mind
to
get
out
the
back
way
if
there
was
a
back
way
and
i
asked
the
shopwoman
if
i
could
step
out
there
and
look
for
the
escaped
slave
who
was
believed
to
be
in
hiding
back
there
somewhere
and
said
i
was
an
officer
in
disguise
and
my
pard
was
yonder
at
the
door
with
one
of
the
murderers
in
charge
and
would
she
be
good
enough
to
step
there
and
tell
him
he
neednt
wait
but
had
better
go
at
once
to
the
further
end
of
the
back
alley
and
be
ready
to
head
him
off
when
i
rousted
him
out
she
was
blazing
with
eagerness
to
see
one
of
those
already
celebrated
murderers
and
she
started
on
the
errand
at
once
i
slipped
out
the
back
way
locked
the
door
behind
me
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
and
started
off
chuckling
to
myself
and
comfortable
well
i
had
gone
and
spoiled
it
again
made
another
mistake
a
double
one
in
fact
there
were
plenty
of
ways
to
get
rid
of
that
officer
by
some
simple
and
plausible
device
but
no
i
must
pick
out
a
picturesque
one
it
is
the
crying
defect
of
my
character
and
then
i
had
ordered
my
procedure
upon
what
the
officer
being
human
would
naturally
do
whereas
when
you
are
least
expecting
it
a
man
will
now
and
then
go
and
do
the
very
thing
which
its
not
natural
for
him
to
do
the
natural
thing
for
the
officer
to
do
in
this
case
was
to
follow
straight
on
my
heels
he
would
find
a
stout
oaken
door
securely
locked
between
him
and
me
before
he
could
break
it
down
i
should
be
far
away
and
engaged
in
slipping
into
a
succession
of
baffling
disguises
which
would
soon
get
me
into
a
sort
of
raiment
which
was
a
surer
protection
from
meddling
lawdogs
in
britain
than
any
amount
of
mere
innocence
and
purity
of
character
but
instead
of
doing
the
natural
thing
the
officer
took
me
at
my
word
and
followed
my
instructions
and
so
as
i
came
trotting
out
of
that
cul
de
sac
full
of
satisfaction
with
my
own
cleverness
he
turned
the
corner
and
i
walked
right
into
his
handcuffs
if
i
had
known
it
was
a
cul
de
sachowever
there
isnt
any
excusing
a
blunder
like
that
let
it
go
charge
it
up
to
profit
and
loss
of
course
i
was
indignant
and
swore
i
had
just
come
ashore
from
a
long
voyage
and
all
that
sort
of
thingjust
to
see
you
know
if
it
would
deceive
that
slave
but
it
didnt
he
knew
me
then
i
reproached
him
for
betraying
me
he
was
more
surprised
than
hurt
he
stretched
his
eyes
wide
and
said
what
wouldst
have
me
let
thee
of
all
men
escape
and
not
hang
with
us
when
thourt
the
very
cause
of
our
hanging
go
to
go
to
was
their
way
of
saying
i
should
smile
or
i
like
that
queer
talkers
those
people
well
there
was
a
sort
of
bastard
justice
in
his
view
of
the
case
and
so
i
dropped
the
matter
when
you
cant
cure
a
disaster
by
argument
what
is
the
use
to
argue
it
isnt
my
way
so
i
only
said
youre
not
going
to
be
hanged
none
of
us
are
both
men
laughed
and
the
slave
said
ye
have
not
ranked
as
a
foolbefore
you
might
better
keep
your
reputation
seeing
the
strain
would
not
be
for
long
it
will
stand
it
i
reckon
before
tomorrow
we
shall
be
out
of
prison
and
free
to
go
where
we
will
besides
the
witty
officer
lifted
at
his
left
ear
with
his
thumb
made
a
rasping
noise
in
his
throat
and
said
out
of
prisonyesye
say
true
and
free
likewise
to
go
where
ye
will
so
ye
wander
not
out
of
his
grace
the
devils
sultry
realm
i
kept
my
temper
and
said
indifferently
now
i
suppose
you
really
think
we
are
going
to
hang
within
a
day
or
two
i
thought
it
not
many
minutes
ago
for
so
the
thing
was
decided
and
proclaimed
ah
then
youve
changed
your
mind
is
that
it
even
that
i
only
thought
then
i
know
now
i
felt
sarcastical
so
i
said
oh
sapient
servant
of
the
law
condescend
to
tell
us
then
what
you
know
that
ye
will
all
be
hanged
today
at
midafternoon
oho
that
shot
hit
home
lean
upon
me
the
fact
is
i
did
need
to
lean
upon
somebody
my
knights
couldnt
arrive
in
time
they
would
be
as
much
as
three
hours
too
late
nothing
in
the
world
could
save
the
king
of
england
nor
me
which
was
more
important
more
important
not
merely
to
me
but
to
the
nationthe
only
nation
on
earth
standing
ready
to
blossom
into
civilization
i
was
sick
i
said
no
more
there
wasnt
anything
to
say
i
knew
what
the
man
meant
that
if
the
missing
slave
was
found
the
postponement
would
be
revoked
the
execution
take
place
today
well

sir
launcelot
and
knights
to
the
rescue
nearing
four
in
the
afternoon
the
scene
was
just
outside
the
walls
of
london
a
cool
comfortable
superb
day
with
a
brilliant
sun
the
kind
of
day
to
make
one
want
to
live
not
die
the
multitude
was
prodigious
and
farreaching
and
yet
we
fifteen
poor
devils
hadnt
a
friend
in
it
there
was
something
painful
in
that
thought
look
at
it
how
you
might
there
we
sat
on
our
tall
scaffold
the
butt
of
the
hate
and
mockery
of
all
those
enemies
we
were
being
made
a
holiday
spectacle
they
had
built
a
sort
of
grand
stand
for
the
nobility
and
gentry
and
these
were
there
in
full
force
with
their
ladies
we
recognized
a
good
many
of
them
the
crowd
got
a
brief
and
unexpected
dash
of
diversion
out
of
the
king
the
moment
we
were
freed
of
our
bonds
he
sprang
up
in
his
fantastic
rags
with
face
bruised
out
of
all
recognition
and
proclaimed
himself
arthur
king
of
britain
and
denounced
the
awful
penalties
of
treason
upon
every
soul
there
present
if
hair
of
his
sacred
head
were
touched
it
startled
and
surprised
him
to
hear
them
break
into
a
vast
roar
of
laughter
it
wounded
his
dignity
and
he
locked
himself
up
in
silence
then
although
the
crowd
begged
him
to
go
on
and
tried
to
provoke
him
to
it
by
catcalls
jeers
and
shouts
of
let
him
speak
the
king
the
king
his
humble
subjects
hunger
and
thirst
for
words
of
wisdom
out
of
the
mouth
of
their
master
his
serene
and
sacred
raggedness
but
it
went
for
nothing
he
put
on
all
his
majesty
and
sat
under
this
rain
of
contempt
and
insult
unmoved
he
certainly
was
great
in
his
way
absently
i
had
taken
off
my
white
bandage
and
wound
it
about
my
right
arm
when
the
crowd
noticed
this
they
began
upon
me
they
said
doubtless
this
sailorman
is
his
ministerobserve
his
costly
badge
of
office
i
let
them
go
on
until
they
got
tired
and
then
i
said
yes
i
am
his
minister
the
boss
and
tomorrow
you
will
hear
that
from
camelot
which
i
got
no
further
they
drowned
me
out
with
joyous
derision
but
presently
there
was
silence
for
the
sheriffs
of
london
in
their
official
robes
with
their
subordinates
began
to
make
a
stir
which
indicated
that
business
was
about
to
begin
in
the
hush
which
followed
our
crime
was
recited
the
death
warrant
read
then
everybody
uncovered
while
a
priest
uttered
a
prayer
then
a
slave
was
blindfolded
the
hangman
unslung
his
rope
there
lay
the
smooth
road
below
us
we
upon
one
side
of
it
the
banked
multitude
wailing
its
other
sidea
good
clear
road
and
kept
free
by
the
policehow
good
it
would
be
to
see
my
five
hundred
horsemen
come
tearing
down
it
but
no
it
was
out
of
the
possibilities
i
followed
its
receding
thread
out
into
the
distancenot
a
horseman
on
it
or
sign
of
one
there
was
a
jerk
and
the
slave
hung
dangling
dangling
and
hideously
squirming
for
his
limbs
were
not
tied
a
second
rope
was
unslung
in
a
moment
another
slave
was
dangling
in
a
minute
a
third
slave
was
struggling
in
the
air
it
was
dreadful
i
turned
away
my
head
a
moment
and
when
i
turned
back
i
missed
the
king
they
were
blindfolding
him
i
was
paralyzed
i
couldnt
move
i
was
choking
my
tongue
was
petrified
they
finished
blindfolding
him
they
led
him
under
the
rope
i
couldnt
shake
off
that
clinging
impotence
but
when
i
saw
them
put
the
noose
around
his
neck
then
everything
let
go
in
me
and
i
made
a
spring
to
the
rescueand
as
i
made
it

ever
was
seen

how
the
plumes
streamed
how
the
sun
flamed
and
flashed
from
the
endless
procession
of
webby
wheels
i
waved
my
right
arm
as
launcelot
swept
inhe
recognized
my
rag
i
tore
away
noose
and
bandage
and
shouted
on
your
knees
every
rascal
of
you
and
salute
the
king
who
fails
shall
sup
in

tonight
i
always
use
that
high
style
when
im
climaxing
an
effect
well
it
was
noble
to
see
launcelot
and
the
boys
swarm
up
onto
that
scaffold
and
heave
sheriffs
and
such
overboard
and
it
was
fine
to
see
that
astonished
multitude
go
down
on
their
knees
and
beg
their
lives
of
the
king
they
had
just
been
deriding
and
insulting
and
as
he
stood
apart
there
receiving
this
homage
in
rags
i
thought
to
myself
well
really
there
is
something
peculiarly
grand
about
the
gait
and
bearing
of
a
king
after
all
i
was
immensely
satisfied
take
the
whole
situation
all
around
it
was
one
of
the
gaudiest
effects
i
ever
instigated
and
presently
up
comes
clarence

own
self

says

modernly
good
deal

it
i
knew
youd
like
it
ive
had
the

you
may
want
to
make
a
note

that
up
to
the
day
set
there
was
no
talk
in
all
britain
of
anything
but
this
combat
all
other
topics
sank
into
insignificance
and
passed
out
of
mens
thoughts
and
interest
it
was
not
because
a
tournament
was
a
great
matter
it
was
not
because
sir
sagramor
had
found
the
holy
grail
for
he
had
not
but
had
failed
it
was
not
because
the
second
official
personage
in
the
kingdom
was
one
of
the
duellists
no
all
these
features
were
commonplace
yet
there
was
abundant
reason
for
the
extraordinary
interest
which
this
coming
fight
was
creating
it
was
born
of
the
fact
that
all
the
nation
knew
that
this
was
not
to
be
a
duel
between
mere
men
so
to
speak
but
a
duel
between
two
mighty
magicians
a
duel
not
of
muscle
but
of
mind
not
of
human
skill
but
of
superhuman
art
and
craft
a
final
struggle
for
supremacy
between
the
two
master
enchanters
of
the
age
it
was
realized
that
the
most
prodigious
achievements
of
the
most
renowned
knights
could
not
be
worthy
of
comparison
with
a
spectacle
like
this
they
could
be
but
childs
play
contrasted
with
this
mysterious
and
awful
battle
of
the
gods
yes
all
the
world
knew
it
was
going
to
be
in
reality
a
duel
between
merlin
and
me
a
measuring
of
his
magic
powers
against
mine
it
was
known
that
merlin
had
been
busy
whole
days
and
nights
together
imbuing
sir
sagramors
arms
and
armor
with
supernal
powers
of
offense
and
defense
and
that
he
had
procured
for
him
from
the
spirits
of
the
air

fleecy
veil
which
would
render
the
wearer
invisible
to
his
antagonist
while
still
visible
to
other
men
against
sir
sagramor
so
weaponed
and
protected
a
thousand
knights
could
accomplish
nothing
against
him
no
known
enchantments
could
prevail
these
facts
were
sure
regarding
them
there
was
no
doubt
no
reason
for
doubt
there
was
but
one
question
might
there
be
still
other
enchantments
unknown
to
merlin
which
could
render
sir
sagramors
veil
transparent
to
me
and
make
his
enchanted
mail
vulnerable
to
my
weapons
this
was
the
one
thing
to
be
decided
in
the
lists
until
then
the
world
must
remain
in
suspense
so
the
world
thought
there
was
a
vast
matter
at
stake
here
and
the
world
was
right
but
it
was
not
the
one
they
had
in
their
minds
no
a
far
vaster
one
was
upon
the
cast
of
this
die
the
life
of
knighterrantry
i
was
a
champion
it
was
true
but
not
the
champion
of
the
frivolous
black
arts
i
was
the
champion
of
hard
unsentimental
commonsense
and
reason
i
was
entering
the
lists
to
either
destroy
knighterrantry
or
be
its
victim
vast
as
the
showgrounds
were
there
were
no
vacant
spaces
in
them
outside
of
the
lists
at
ten
oclock
on
the
morning
of
the
16th
the
mammoth
grandstand
was
clothed
in
flags
streamers
and
rich
tapestries
and
packed
with
several
acres
of
smallfry
tributary
kings
their
suites
and
the
british
aristocracy
with
our
own
royal
gang
in
the
chief
place
and
each
and
every
individual
a
flashing
prism
of
gaudy
silks
and
velvetswell
i
never
saw
anything
to
begin
with
it
but
a
fight
between
an
upper
mississippi
sunset
and
the
aurora
borealis
the
huge
camp
of
beflagged
and
gaycolored
tents
at
one
end
of
the
lists
with
a
stiffstanding
sentinel
at
every
door
and
a
shining
shield
hanging
by
him
for
challenge
was
another
fine
sight
you
see
every
knight
was
there
who
had
any
ambition
or
any
caste
feeling
for
my
feeling
toward
their
order
was
not
much
of
a
secret
and
so
here
was
their
chance
if
i
won
my
fight
with
sir
sagramor
others
would
have
the
right
to
call
me
out
as
long
as
i
might
be
willing
to
respond
down
at
our
end
there
were
but
two
tents
one
for
me
and
another
for
my
servants
at
the
appointed
hour
the
king
made
a
sign
and
the
heralds
in
their
tabards
appeared
and
made
proclamation
naming
the
combatants
and
stating
the
cause
of
quarrel
there
was
a
pause
then
a
ringing
bugleblast
which
was
the
signal
for
us
to
come
forth
all
the
multitude
caught
their
breath
and
an
eager
curiosity
flashed
into
every
face
out
from
his
tent
rode
great
sir
sagramor
an
imposing
tower
of
iron
stately
and
rigid
his
huge
spear
standing
upright
in
its
socket
and
grasped
in
his
strong
hand
his
grand
horses
face
and
breast
cased
in
steel
his
body
clothed
in
rich
trappings
that
almost
dragged
the
groundoh
a
most
noble
picture
a
great
shout
went
up
of
welcome
and
admiration
and
then
out
i
came
but
i
didnt
get
any
shout
there
was
a
wondering
and
eloquent
silence
for
a
moment
then
a
great
wave
of
laughter
began
to
sweep
along
that
human
sea
but
a
warning
bugleblast
cut
its
career
short
i
was
in
the
simplest
and
comfortablest
of
gymnast
costumesfleshcolored
tights
from
neck
to
heel
with
blue
silk
puffings
about
my
loins
and
bareheaded
my
horse
was
not
above
medium
size
but
he
was
alert
slenderlimbed
muscled
with
watchsprings
and
just
a
greyhound
to
go
he
was
a
beauty
glossy
as
silk
and
naked
as
he
was
when
he
was
born
except
for
bridle
and
rangersaddle
the
iron
tower
and
the
gorgeous
bedquilt
came
cumbrously
but
gracefully
pirouetting
down
the
lists
and
we
tripped
lightly
up
to
meet
them
we
halted
the
tower
saluted
i
responded
then
we
wheeled
and
rode
side
by
side
to
the
grandstand
and
faced
our
king
and
queen
to
whom
we
made
obeisance
the
queen
exclaimed
alack
sir
boss
wilt
fight
naked
and
without
lance
or
sword
or
but
the
king
checked
her
and
made
her
understand
with
a
polite
phrase
or
two
that
this
was
none
of
her
business
the
bugles
rang
again
and
we
separated
and
rode
to
the
ends
of
the
lists
and
took
position
now
old
merlin
stepped
into
view
and
cast
a
dainty
web
of
gossamer
threads
over
sir
sagramor
which
turned
him
into
hamlets
ghost
the
king
made
a
sign
the
bugles
blew
sir
sagramor
laid
his
great
lance
in
rest
and
the
next
moment
here
he
came
thundering
down
the
course
with
his
veil
flying
out
behind
and
i
went
whistling
through
the
air
like
an
arrow
to
meet
him
cocking
my
ear
the
while
as
if
noting
the
invisible
knights
position
and
progress
by
hearing
not
sight
a
chorus
of
encouraging
shouts
burst
out
for
him
and
one
brave
voice
flung
out
a
heartening
word
for
mesaid
go
it
slim
jim
it
was
an
even
bet
that
clarence
had
procured
that
favor
for
me
and
furnished
the
language
too
when
that
formidable
lancepoint
was
within
a
yard
and
a
half
of
my
breast
i
twitched
my
horse
aside
without
an
effort
and
the
big
knight
swept
by
scoring
a
blank
i
got
plenty
of
applause
that
time
we
turned
braced
up
and
down
we
came
again
another
blank
for
the
knight
a
roar
of
applause
for
me
this
same
thing
was
repeated
once
more
and
it
fetched
such
a
whirlwind
of
applause
that
sir
sagramor
lost
his
temper
and
at
once
changed
his
tactics
and
set
himself
the
task
of
chasing
me
down
why
he
hadnt
any
show
in
the
world
at
that
it
was
a
game
of
tag
with
all
the
advantage
on
my
side
i
whirled
out
of
his
path
with
ease
whenever
i
chose
and
once
i
slapped
him
on
the
back
as
i
went
to
the
rear
finally
i
took
the
chase
into
my
own
hands
and
after
that
turn
or
twist
or
do
what
he
would
he
was
never
able
to
get
behind
me
again
he
found
himself
always
in
front
at
the
end
of
his
maneuver
so
he
gave
up
that
business
and
retired
to
his
end
of
the
lists
his
temper
was
clear
gone
now
and
he
forgot
himself
and
flung
an
insult
at
me
which
disposed
of
mine
i
slipped
my
lasso
from
the
horn
of
my
saddle
and
grasped
the
coil
in
my
right
hand
this
time
you
should
have
seen
him
comeit
was
a
business
trip
sure
by
his
gait
there
was
blood
in
his
eye
i
was
sitting
my
horse
at
ease
and
swinging
the
great
loop
of
my
lasso
in
wide
circles
about
my
head
the
moment
he
was
under
way
i
started
for
him
when
the
space
between
us
had
narrowed
to
forty
feet
i
sent
the
snaky
spirals
of
the
rope
acleaving
through
the
air
then
darted
aside
and
faced
about
and
brought
my
trained
animal
to
a
halt
with
all
his
feet
braced
under
him
for
a
surge
the
next
moment
the
rope
sprang
taut
and
yanked
sir
sagramor
out
of
the
saddle
great
scott
but
there
was
a
sensation
unquestionably
the
popular
thing
in
this
world
is
novelty
these
people
had
never
seen
anything
of
that
cowboy
business
before
and
it
carried
them
clear
off
their
feet
with
delight
from
all
around
and
everywhere
the
shout
went
up
encore
encore
i
wondered
where
they
got
the
word
but
there
was
no
time
to
cipher
on
philological
matters
because
the
whole
knighterrantry
hive
was
just
humming
now
and
my
prospect
for
trade
couldnt
have
been
better
the
moment
my
lasso
was
released
and
sir
sagramor
had
been
assisted
to
his
tent
i
hauled
in
the
slack
took
my
station
and
began
to
swing
my
loop
around
my
head
again
i
was
sure
to
have
use
for
it
as
soon
as
they
could
elect
a
successor
for
sir
sagramor
and
that
couldnt
take
long
where
there
were
so
many
hungry
candidates
indeed
they
elected
one
straight
off
sir
hervis
de
revel
bzz
here
he
came
like
a
house
afire
i
dodged
he
passed
like
a
flash
with
my
horsehair
coils
settling
around
his
neck
a
second
or
so
later
fst
his
saddle
was
empty
i
got
another
encore
and
another
and
another
and
still
another
when
i
had
snaked
five
men
out
things
began
to
look
serious
to
the
ironclads
and
they
stopped
and
consulted
together
as
a
result
they
decided
that
it
was
time
to
waive
etiquette
and
send
their
greatest
and
best
against
me
to
the
astonishment
of
that
little
world
i
lassoed
sir
lamorak
de
galis
and
after
him
sir
galahad
so
you
see
there
was
simply
nothing
to
be
done
now
but
play
their
right
bowerbring
out
the
superbest
of
the
superb
the
mightiest
of
the
mighty
the
great
sir
launcelot
himself
a
proud
moment
for
me
i
should
think
so
yonder
was
arthur
king
of
britain
yonder
was
guenever
yes
and
whole
tribes
of
little
provincial
kings
and
kinglets
and
in
the
tented
camp
yonder
renowned
knights
from
many
lands
and
likewise
the
selectest
body
known
to
chivalry
the
knights
of
the
table
round
the
most
illustrious
in
christendom
and
biggest
fact
of
all
the
very
sun
of
their
shining
system
was
yonder
couching
his
lance
the
focal
point
of
forty
thousand
adoring
eyes
and
all
by
myself
here
was
i
laying
for
him
across
my
mind
flitted
the
dear
image
of
a
certain
hellogirl
of
west
hartford
and
i
wished
she
could
see
me
now
in
that
moment
down
came
the
invincible
with
the
rush
of
a
whirlwindthe
courtly
world
rose
to
its
feet
and
bent
forward
the
fateful
coils
went
circling
through
the
air
and
before
you
could
wink
i
was
towing
sir
launcelot
across
the
field
on
his
back
and
kissing
my
hand
to
the
storm
of
waving
kerchiefs
and
the
thundercrash
of
applause
that
greeted
me
said
i
to
myself
as
i
coiled
my
lariat
and
hung
it
on
my
saddlehorn
and
sat
there
drunk
with
glory
the
victory
is
perfectno
other
will
venture
against
meknighterrantry
is
dead
now
imagine
my
astonishmentand
everybody
elses
tooto
hear
the
peculiar
buglecall
which
announces
that
another
competitor
is
about
to
enter
the
lists
there
was
a
mystery
here
i
couldnt
account
for
this
thing
next
i
noticed
merlin
gliding
away
from
me
and
then
i
noticed
that
my
lasso
was
gone
the
old
sleightofhand
expert
had
stolen
it
sure
and
slipped
it
under
his
robe
the
bugle
blew
again
i
looked
and
down
came
sagramor
riding
again
with
his
dust
brushed
off
and
his
veil
nicely
rearranged
i
trotted
up
to
meet
him
and
pretended
to
find
him
by
the
sound
of
his
horses
hoofs
he
said
thourt
quick
of
ear
but
it
will
not
save
thee
from
this
and
he
touched
the
hilt
of
his
great
sword
an
ye
are
not
able
to
see
it
because
of
the
influence
of
the
veil
know
that
it
is
no
cumbrous
lance
but
a
swordand
i
ween
ye
will
not
be
able
to
avoid
it
his
visor
was
up
there
was
death
in
his
smile
i
should
never
be
able
to
dodge
his
sword
that
was
plain
somebody
was
going
to
die
this
time
if
he
got
the
drop
on
me
i
could
name
the
corpse
we
rode
forward
together
and
saluted
the
royalties
this
time
the
king
was
disturbed
he
said
where
is
thy
strange
weapon
it
is
stolen
sire
hast
another
at
hand
no
sire
i
brought
only
the
one
then
merlin
mixed
in
he
brought
but
the
one
because
there
was
but
the
one
to
bring
there
exists
none
other
but
that
one
it
belongeth
to
the
king
of
the
demons
of
the
sea
this
man
is
a
pretender
and
ignorant
else
he
had
known
that
that
weapon
can
be
used
in
but
eight
bouts
only
and
then
it
vanisheth
away
to
its
home
under
the
sea
then
is
he
weaponless
said
the
king
sir
sagramore
ye
will
grant
him
leave
to
borrow
and
i
will
lend
said
sir
launcelot
limping
up
he
is
as
brave
a
knight
of
his
hands
as
any
that
be
on
live
and
he
shall
have
mine
he
put
his
hand
on
his
sword
to
draw
it
but
sir
sagramor
said
stay
it
may
not
be
he
shall
fight
with
his
own
weapons
it
was
his
privilege
to
choose
them
and
bring
them
if
he
has
erred
on
his
head
be
it
knight
said
the
king
thourt
overwrought
with
passion
it
disorders
thy
mind
wouldst
kill
a
naked
man
an
he
do
it
he
shall
answer
it
to
me
said
sir
launcelot
i
will
answer
it
to
any
he
that
desireth
retorted
sir
sagramor
hotly
merlin
broke
in
rubbing
his
hands
and
smiling
his
lowdownest
smile
of
malicious
gratification
tis
well
said
right
well
said
and
tis
enough
of
parleying
let
my
lord
the
king
deliver
the
battle
signal
the
king
had
to
yield
the
bugle
made
proclamation
and
we
turned
apart
and
rode
to
our
stations
there
we
stood
a
hundred
yards
apart
facing
each
other
rigid
and
motionless
like
horsed
statues
and
so
we
remained
in
a
soundless
hush
as
much
as
a
full
minute
everybody
gazing
nobody
stirring
it
seemed
as
if
the
king
could
not
take
heart
to
give
the
signal
but
at
last
he
lifted
his
hand
the
clear
note
of
the
bugle
followed
sir
sagramors
long
blade
described
a
flashing
curve
in
the
air
and
it
was
superb
to
see
him
come
i
sat
still
on
he
came
i
did
not
move
people
got
so
excited
that
they
shouted
to
me
fly
fly
save
thyself
this
is
murther
i
never
budged
so
much
as
an
inch
till
that
thundering
apparition
had
got
within
fifteen
paces
of
me
then
i
snatched
a
dragoon
revolver
out
of
my
holster
there
was
a
flash
and
a
roar
and
the
revolver
was
back
in
the
holster
before
anybody
could
tell
what
had
happened
here
was
a
riderless
horse
plunging
by
and
yonder
lay
sir
sagramor
stone
dead
the
people
that
ran
to
him
were
stricken
dumb
to
find
that
the
life
was
actually
gone
out
of
the
man
and
no
reason
for
it
visible
no
hurt
upon
his
body
nothing
like
a
wound
there
was
a
hole
through
the
breast
of
his
chainmail
but
they
attached
no
importance
to
a
little
thing
like
that
and
as
a
bullet
wound
there
produces
but
little
blood
none
came
in
sight
because
of
the
clothing
and
swaddlings
under
the
armor
the
body
was
dragged
over
to
let
the
king
and
the
swells
look
down
upon
it
they
were
stupefied
with
astonishment
naturally
i
was
requested
to
come
and
explain
the
miracle
but
i
remained
in
my
tracks
like
a
statue
and
said
if
it
is
a
command
i
will
come
but
my
lord
the
king
knows
that
i
am
where
the
laws
of
combat
require
me
to
remain
while
any
desire
to
come
against
me
i
waited
nobody
challenged
then
i
said
if
there
are
any
who
doubt
that
this
field
is
well
and
fairly
won
i
do
not
wait
for
them
to
challenge
me
i
challenge
them
it
is
a
gallant
offer
said
the
king
and
well
beseems
you
whom
will
you
name
first
i
name
none
i
challenge
all
here
i
stand
and
dare
the
chivalry
of
england
to
come
against
menot
by
individuals
but
in
mass
what
shouted
a
score
of
knights
you
have
heard
the
challenge
take
it
or
i
proclaim
you
recreant
knights
and
vanquished
every
one
it
was
a
bluff
you
know
at
such
a
time
it
is
sound
judgment
to
put
on
a
bold
face
and
play
your
hand
for
a
hundred
times
what
it
is
worth
fortynine
times
out
of
fifty
nobody
dares
to
call
and
you
rake
in
the
chips
but
just
this
oncewell
things
looked
squally
in
just
no
time
five
hundred
knights
were
scrambling
into
their
saddles
and
before
you
could
wink
a
widely
scattering
drove
were
under
way
and
clattering
down
upon
me
i
snatched
both
revolvers
from
the
holsters
and
began
to
measure
distances
and
calculate
chances
bang
one
saddle
empty
bang
another
one
bangbang
and
i
bagged
two
well
it
was
nip
and
tuck
with
us
and
i
knew
it
if
i
spent
the
eleventh
shot
without
convincing
these
people
the
twelfth
man
would
kill
me
sure
and
so
i
never
did
feel
so
happy
as
i
did
when
my
ninth
downed
its
man
and
i
detected
the
wavering
in
the
crowd
which
is
premonitory
of
panic
an
instant
lost
now
could
knock
out
my
last
chance
but
i
didnt
lose
it
i
raised
both
revolvers
and
pointed
themthe
halted
host
stood
their
ground
just
about
one
good
square
moment
then
broke
and
fled
the
day
was
mine
knighterrantry
was
a
doomed
institution
the
march
of
civilization
was
begun
how
did
i
feel
ah
you
never
could
imagine
it
and
brer
merlin
his
stock
was
flat
again
somehow
every
time
the
magic
of
folderol
tried
conclusions
with
the
magic
of
science
the
magic
of
folderol
got
left
chapter
xl
three
years
later
when
i
broke
the
back
of
knighterrantry
that
time
i
no
longer
felt
obliged
to
work
in
secret
so
the
very
next
day
i
exposed
my
hidden
schools
my
mines
and
my
vast
system
of
clandestine
factories
and
workshops
to
an
astonished
world
that
is
to
say
i
exposed
the
nineteenth
century
to
the
inspection
of
the
sixth
well
it
is
always
a
good
plan
to
follow
up
an
advantage
promptly
the
knights
were
temporarily
down
but
if
i
would
keep
them
so
i
must
just
simply
paralyze
themnothing
short
of
that
would
answer
you
see
i
was
bluffing
that
last
time
in
the
field
it
would
be
natural
for
them
to
work
around
to
that
conclusion
if
i
gave
them
a
chance
so
i
must
not
give
them
time
and
i
didnt
i
renewed
my
challenge
engraved
it
on
brass
posted
it
up
where
any
priest
could
read
it
to
them
and
also
kept
it
standing
in
the
advertising
columns
of
the
paper
i
not
only
renewed
it
but
added
to
its
proportions
i
said
name
the
day
and
i
would
take
fifty
assistants
and
stand
up
against
the
massed
chivalry
of
the
whole
earth
and
destroy
it
i
was
not
bluffing
this
time
i
meant
what
i
said
i
could
do
what
i
promised
there
wasnt
any
way
to
misunderstand
the
language
of
that
challenge
even
the
dullest
of
the
chivalry
perceived
that
this
was
a
plain
case
of
put
up
or
shut
up
they
were
wise
and
did
the
latter
in
all
the
next
three
years
they
gave
me
no
trouble
worth
mentioning
consider
the
three
years
sped
now
look
around
on
england
a
happy
and
prosperous
country
and
strangely
altered
schools
everywhere
and
several
colleges
a
number
of
pretty
good
newspapers
even
authorship
was
taking
a
start
sir
dinadan
the
humorist
was
first
in
the
field
with
a
volume
of
grayheaded
jokes
which
i
had
been
familiar
with
during
thirteen
centuries
if
he
had
left
out
that
old
rancid
one
about
the
lecturer
i
wouldnt
have
said
anything
but
i
couldnt
stand
that
one
i
suppressed
the
book
and
hanged
the
author
slavery
was
dead
and
gone
all
men
were
equal
before
the
law
taxation
had
been
equalized
the
telegraph
the
telephone
the
phonograph
the
typewriter
the
sewingmachine
and
all
the
thousand
willing
and
handy
servants
of
steam
and
electricity
were
working
their
way
into
favor
we
had
a
steamboat
or
two
on
the
thames
we
had
steam
warships
and
the
beginnings
of
a
steam
commercial
marine
i
was
getting
ready
to
send
out
an
expedition
to
discover
america
we
were
building
several
lines
of
railway
and
our
line
from
camelot
to
london
was
already
finished
and
in
operation
i
was
shrewd
enough
to
make
all
offices
connected
with
the
passenger
service
places
of
high
and
distinguished
honor
my
idea
was
to
attract
the
chivalry
and
nobility
and
make
them
useful
and
keep
them
out
of
mischief
the
plan
worked
very
well
the
competition
for
the
places
was
hot
the
conductor
of
the
433
express
was
a
duke
there
wasnt
a
passenger
conductor
on
the
line
below
the
degree
of
earl
they
were
good
men
every
one
but
they
had
two
defects
which
i
couldnt
cure
and
so
had
to
wink
at
they
wouldnt
lay
aside
their
armor
and
they
would
knock
down
fare
i
mean
rob
the
company
there
was
hardly
a
knight
in
all
the
land
who
wasnt
in
some
useful
employment
they
were
going
from
end
to
end
of
the
country
in
all
manner
of
useful
missionary
capacities
their
penchant
for
wandering
and
their
experience
in
it
made
them
altogether
the
most
effective
spreaders
of
civilization
we
had
they
went
clothed
in
steel
and
equipped
with
sword
and
lance
and
battleaxe
and
if
they
couldnt
persuade
a
person
to
try
a
sewingmachine
on
the
installment
plan
or
a
melodeon
or
a
barbedwire
fence
or
a
prohibition
journal
or
any
of
the
other
thousand
and
one
things
they
canvassed
for
they
removed
him
and
passed
on
i
was
very
happy
things
were
working
steadily
toward
a
secretly
longedfor
point
you
see
i
had
two
schemes
in
my
head
which
were
the
vastest
of
all
my
projects
the
one
was
to
overthrow
the
catholic
church
and
set
up
the
protestant
faith
on
its
ruins
not
as
an
established
church
but
a
goasyouplease
one
and
the
other
project
was
to
get
a
decree
issued
by
and
by
commanding
that
upon
arthurs
death
unlimited
suffrage
should
be
introduced
and
given
to
men
and
women
alikeat
any
rate
to
all
men
wise
or
unwise
and
to
all
mothers
who
at
middle
age
should
be
found
to
know
nearly
as
much
as
their
sons
at
twentyone
arthur
was
good
for
thirty
years
yet
he
being
about
my
own
agethat
is
to
say
fortyand
i
believed
that
in
that
time
i
could
easily
have
the
active
part
of
the
population
of
that
day
ready
and
eager
for
an
event
which
should
be
the
first
of
its
kind
in
the
history
of
the
worlda
rounded
and
complete
governmental
revolution
without
bloodshed
the
result
to
be
a
republic
well
i
may
as
well
confess
though
i
do
feel
ashamed
when
i
think
of
it
i
was
beginning
to
have
a
base
hankering
to
be
its
first
president
myself
yes
there
was
more
or
less
human
nature
in
me
i
found
that
out
clarence
was
with
me
as
concerned
the
revolution
but
in
a
modified
way
his
idea
was
a
republic
without
privileged
orders
but
with
a
hereditary
royal
family
at
the
head
of
it
instead
of
an
elective
chief
magistrate
he
believed
that
no
nation
that
had
ever
known
the
joy
of
worshiping
a
royal
family
could
ever
be
robbed
of
it
and
not
fade
away
and
die
of
melancholy
i
urged
that
kings
were
dangerous
he
said
then
have
cats
he
was
sure
that
a
royal
family
of
cats
would
answer
every
purpose
they
would
be
as
useful
as
any
other
royal
family
they
would
know
as
much
they
would
have
the
same
virtues
and
the
same
treacheries
the
same
disposition
to
get
up
shindies
with
other
royal
cats
they
would
be
laughably
vain
and
absurd
and
never
know
it
they
would
be
wholly
inexpensive
finally
they
would
have
as
sound
a
divine
right
as
any
other
royal
house
and
tom
vii
or
tom
xi
or
tom
xiv
by
the
grace
of
god
king
would
sound
as
well
as
it
would
when
applied
to
the
ordinary
royal
tomcat
with
tights
on
and
as
a
rule
said
he
in
his
neat
modern
english
the
character
of
these
cats
would
be
considerably
above
the
character
of
the
average
king
and
this
would
be
an
immense
moral
advantage
to
the
nation
for
the
reason
that
a
nation
always

its
morals
after
its
monarchs
the
worship
of
royalty
being
founded
in
unreason
these
graceful
and
harmless
cats
would
easily
become
as
sacred
as
any
other
royalties
and
indeed
more
so
because
it
would
presently
be
noticed
that
they
hanged
nobody
beheaded
nobody
imprisoned
nobody
inflicted
no
cruelties
or
injustices
of
any
sort
and
so
must
be
worthy
of
a
deeper
love
and
reverence
than
the
customary
human
king
and
would
certainly
get
it
the
eyes
of
the
whole
harried
world
would
soon
be
fixed
upon
this
humane
and
gentle
system
and
royal
butchers
would
presently
begin
to
disappear
their
subjects
would
fill
the
vacancies
with
catlings
from
our
own
royal
house
we
should
become
a
factory
we
should
supply
the
thrones
of
the
world
within
forty
years
all
europe
would
be
governed
by
cats
and
we
should
furnish
the
cats
the
reign
of
universal
peace
would
begin
then
to
end
no
more
forever

i
supposed
he
was
in
earnest
and
was
beginning
to
be
persuaded
by
him
until
he
exploded
that
cathowl
and
startled
me
almost
out
of
my
clothes
but
he
never
could
be
in
earnest
he
didnt
know
what
it
was
he
had
pictured
a
distinct
and
perfectly
rational
and
feasible
improvement
upon
constitutional
monarchy
but
he
was
too
featherheaded
to
know
it
or
care
anything
about
it
either
i
was
going
to
give
him
a
scolding
but
sandy
came
flying
in
at
that
moment
wild
with
terror
and
so
choked
with
sobs
that
for
a
minute
she
could
not
get
her
voice
i
ran
and
took
her
in
my
arms
and
lavished
caresses
upon
her
and
said
beseechingly
speak
darling
speak
what
is
it
her
head
fell
limp
upon
my
bosom
and
she
gasped
almost
inaudibly

quick
i
shouted
to

the
kings
homeopath
to
come
in
two
minutes
i
was
kneeling
by
the
childs

and
sandy
was
dispatching
servants
here
there
and
everywhere
all
over
the
palace
i
took
in
the
situation
almost
at
a

croup
i
bent
down
and
whispered

sweetheart
hellocentral
she
opened
her
soft
eyes
languidly
and
made
out
to
say
papa
that
was
a
comfort
she
was
far
from
dead
yet
i
sent
for
preparations
of
sulphur
i
rousted
out
the
croupkettle
myself
for
i
dont
sit
down
and
wait
for
doctors
when
sandy
or
the
child
is
sick
i
knew
how
to
nurse
both
of
them
and
had
had
experience
this
little
chap
had
lived
in
my
arms
a
good
part
of
its
small
life
and
often
i
could
soothe
away
its
troubles
and
get
it
to
laugh
through
the
teardews
on
its
eyelashes
when
even
its
mother
couldnt
sir
launcelot
in
his
richest
armor
came
striding
along
the
great
hall
now
on
his
way
to
the
stockboard
he
was
president
of
the
stockboard
and
occupied
the
siege
perilous
which
he
had
bought
of
sir
galahad
for
the
stockboard
consisted
of
the
knights
of
the
round
table
and
they
used
the
round
table
for
business
purposes
now
seats
at
it
were
worthwell
you
would
never
believe
the
figure
so
it
is
no
use
to
state
it
sir
launcelot
was
a
bear
and
he
had
put
up
a
corner
in
one
of
the
new
lines
and
was
just
getting
ready
to
squeeze
the
shorts
today
but
what
of
that
he
was
the
same
old
launcelot
and
when
he
glanced
in
as
he
was
passing
the
door
and
found
out
that
his
pet
was
sick
that
was
enough
for
him
bulls
and
bears
might
fight
it
out
their
own
way
for
all
him
he
would
come
right
in
here
and
stand
by
little
hellocentral
for
all
he
was
worth
and
that
was
what
he
did
he
shied
his
helmet
into
the
corner
and
in
half
a
minute
he
had
a
new
wick
in
the
alcohol
lamp
and
was
firing
up
on
the
croupkettle
by
this
time
sandy
had
built
a
blanket
canopy
over
the
crib
and
everything
was
ready
sir
launcelot
got
up
steam
he
and
i
loaded
up
the
kettle
with
unslaked
lime
and
carbolic
acid
with
a
touch
of
lactic
acid
added
thereto
then
filled
the
thing
up
with
water
and
inserted
the
steamspout
under
the
canopy
everything
was
shipshape
now
and
we
sat
down
on
either
side
of
the
crib
to
stand
our
watch
sandy
was
so
grateful
and
so
comforted
that
she
charged
a
couple
of
churchwardens
with
willowbark
and
sumachtobacco
for
us
and
told
us
to
smoke
as
much
as
we
pleased
it
couldnt
get
under
the
canopy
and
she
was
used
to
smoke
being
the
first
lady
in
the
land
who
had
ever
seen
a
cloud
blown
well
there
couldnt
be
a
more
contented
or
comfortable
sight
than
sir
launcelot
in
his
noble
armor
sitting
in
gracious
serenity
at
the
end
of
a
yard
of
snowy
churchwarden
he
was
a
beautiful
man
a
lovely
man
and
was
just
intended
to
make
a
wife
and
children
happy
but
of
course
gueneverhowever
its
no
use
to
cry
over
whats
done
and
cant
be
helped
well
he
stood
watchandwatch
with
me
right
straight
through
for
three
days
and
nights
till
the
child
was
out
of
danger
then
he
took
her
up
in
his
great
arms
and
kissed
her
with
his
plumes
falling
about
her
golden
head
then
laid
her
softly
in
sandys
lap
again
and
took
his
stately
way
down
the
vast
hall
between
the
ranks
of
admiring
menatarms
and
menials
and
so
disappeared
and
no
instinct
warned
me
that
i
should
never
look
upon
him
again
in
this
world
lord
what
a
world
of
heartbreak
it
is
the
doctors
said
we
must
take
the
child
away
if
we
would
coax
her
back
to
health
and
strength
again
and
she
must
have
seaair
so
we
took
a
manofwar
and
a
suite
of
two
hundred
and
sixty
persons
and
went
cruising
about
and
after
a
fortnight
of
this
we
stepped
ashore
on
the
french
coast
and
the
doctors
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
make
something
of
a
stay
there
the
little
king
of
that
region
offered
us
his
hospitalities
and
we
were
glad
to
accept
if
he
had
had
as
many
conveniences
as
he
lacked
we
should
have
been
plenty
comfortable
enough
even
as
it
was
we
made
out
very
well
in
his
queer
old
castle
by
the
help
of
comforts
and
luxuries
from
the
ship
at
the
end
of
a
month
i
sent
the
vessel
home
for
fresh
supplies
and
for
news
we
expected
her
back
in
three
or
four
days
she
would
bring
me
along
with
other
news
the
result
of
a
certain
experiment
which
i
had
been
starting
it
was
a
project
of
mine
to
replace
the
tournament
with
something
which
might
furnish
an
escape
for
the
extra
steam
of
the
chivalry
keep
those
bucks
entertained
and
out
of
mischief
and
at
the
same
time
preserve
the
best
thing
in
them
which
was
their
hardy
spirit
of
emulation
i
had
had
a
choice
band
of
them
in
private
training
for
some
time
and
the
date
was
now
arriving
for
their
first
public
effort
this
experiment
was
baseball
in
order
to
give
the
thing
vogue
from
the
start
and
place
it
out
of
the
reach
of
criticism
i
chose
my
nines
by
rank
not
capacity
there
wasnt
a
knight
in
either
team
who
wasnt
a
sceptered
sovereign
as
for
material
of
this
sort
there
was
a
glut
of
it
always
around
arthur
you
couldnt
throw
a
brick
in
any
direction
and
not
cripple
a
king
of
course
i
couldnt
get
these
people
to
leave
off
their
armor
they
wouldnt
do
that
when
they
bathed
they
consented
to
differentiate
the
armor
so
that
a
body
could
tell
one
team
from
the
other
but
that
was
the
most
they
would
do
so
one
of
the
teams
wore
chainmail
ulsters
and
the
other
wore
platearmor
made
of
my
new
bessemer
steel
their
practice
in
the
field
was
the
most
fantastic
thing
i
ever
saw
being
ballproof
they
never
skipped
out
of
the
way
but
stood
still
and
took
the
result
when
a
bessemer
was
at
the
bat
and
a
ball
hit
him
it
would
bound
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
sometimes
and
when
a
man
was
running
and
threw
himself
on
his
stomach
to
slide
to
his
base
it
was
like
an
ironclad
coming
into
port
at
first
i
appointed
men
of
no
rank
to
act
as
umpires
but
i
had
to
discontinue
that
these
people
were
no
easier
to
please
than
other
nines
the
umpires
first
decision
was
usually
his
last
they
broke
him
in
two
with
a
bat
and
his
friends
toted
him
home
on
a
shutter
when
it
was
noticed
that
no
umpire
ever
survived
a
game
umpiring
got
to
be
unpopular
so
i
was
obliged
to
appoint
somebody
whose
rank
and
lofty
position
under
the
government
would
protect
him

going

to

everything
would
be
favorable
it
was
balmy
and
beautiful
spring
weather
now
and
nature
was
all
tailored
out
in
her
new
clothes
chapter
xli
the
interdict
however
my
attention
was
suddenly
snatched
from
such
matters
our
child
began
to
lose
ground
again
and
we
had
to
go
to
sitting
up
with
her
her
case
became
so
serious
we
couldnt
bear
to
allow
anybody
to
help
in
this
service
so
we
two
stood
watchandwatch
day
in
and
day
out
ah
sandy
what
a
right
heart
she
had
how
simple
and
genuine
and
good
she
was
she
was
a
flawless
wife
and
mother
and
yet
i
had
married
her
for
no
other
particular
reasons
except
that
by
the
customs
of
chivalry
she
was
my
property
until
some
knight
should
win
her
from
me
in
the
field
she
had
hunted
britain
over
for
me
had
found
me
at
the
hangingbout
outside
of
london
and
had
straightway
resumed
her
old
place
at
my
side
in
the
placidest
way
and
as
of
right
i
was
a
new
englander
and
in
my
opinion
this
sort
of
partnership
would
compromise
her
sooner
or
later
she
couldnt
see
how
but
i
cut
argument
short
and
we
had
a
wedding
now
i
didnt
know
i
was
drawing
a
prize
yet
that
was
what
i
did
draw
within
the
twelvemonth
i
became
her
worshiper
and
ours
was
the
dearest
and
perfectest
comradeship
that
ever
was
people
talk
about
beautiful
friendships
between
two
persons
of
the
same
sex
what
is
the
best
of
that
sort
as
compared
with
the
friendship
of
man
and
wife
where
the
best
impulses
and
highest
ideals
of
both
are
the
same
there
is
no
place
for
comparison
between
the
two
friendships
the
one
is
earthly
the
other
divine
in
my
dreams
along
at
first
i
still
wandered
thirteen
centuries
away
and
my
unsatisfied
spirit
went
calling
and
harking
all
up
and
down
the
unreplying
vacancies
of
a
vanished
world
many
a
time
sandy
heard
that
imploring
cry
come
from
my
lips
in
my
sleep
with
a
grand
magnanimity
she
saddled
that
cry
of
mine
upon
our
child
conceiving
it
to
be
the
name
of
some
lost
darling
of
mine
it
touched
me
to
tears
and
it
also
nearly
knocked
me
off
my
feet
too
when
she
smiled
up
in
my
face
for
an
earned
reward
and
played
her
quaint
and
pretty
surprise
upon
me
the
name
of
one
who
was
dear
to
thee
is
here
preserved
here
made
holy
and
the
music
of
it
will
abide
alway
in
our
ears
now
thoult
kiss
me
as
knowing
the
name
i
have
given
the
child
but
i
didnt
know
it
all
the
same
i
hadnt
an
idea
in
the
world
but
it
would
have
been
cruel
to
confess
it
and
spoil
her
pretty
game
so
i
never
let
on
but
said
yes
i
know
sweethearthow
dear
and
good
it
is
of
you
too
but
i
want
to
hear
these
lips
of
yours
which
are
also
mine
utter
it
firstthen
its
music
will
be
perfect
pleased
to
the
marrow
she
murmured
hellocentral
i
didnt
laughi
am
always
thankful
for
thatbut
the
strain
ruptured
every
cartilage
in
me
and
for
weeks
afterward
i
could
hear
my
bones
clack
when
i
walked
she
never
found
out
her
mistake
the
first
time
she
heard
that
form
of
salute
used
at
the
telephone
she
was
surprised
and
not
pleased
but
i
told
her
i
had
given
order
for
it
that
henceforth
and
forever
the
telephone
must
always
be
invoked
with
that
reverent
formality
in
perpetual
honor
and
remembrance
of
my
lost
friend
and
her
small
namesake
this
was
not
true
but
it
answered
well
during
two
weeks
and
a
half
we
watched
by
the
crib
and
in
our
deep
solicitude
we
were
unconscious
of
any
world
outside
of
that
sickroom
then
our
reward
came
the
center
of
the
universe
turned
the
corner
and
began
to
mend
grateful
it
isnt
the
term
there
isnt
any
term
for
it
you
know
that
yourself
if
youve
watched
your
child
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
and
seen
it
come
back
to
life
and
sweep
night
out
of
the
earth
with
one
allilluminating
smile
that
you
could
cover
with
your
hand
why
we
were
back
in
this
world
in
one
instant
then
we
looked
the
same
startled
thought
into
each
others
eyes
at
the
same
moment
more
than
two
weeks
gone
and
that
ship
not
back
yet
in
another
minute
i
appeared
in
the
presence
of
my
train
they
had
been
steeped
in
troubled
bodings
all
this
timetheir
faces
showed
it
i
called
an
escort
and
we
galloped
five
miles
to
a
hilltop
overlooking
the
sea
where
was
my
great
commerce
that
so
lately
had
made
these
glistening
expanses
populous
and
beautiful
with
its
whitewinged
flocks
vanished
every
one
not
a
sail
from

to

not
a
smokebankjust
a
dead
and
empty
solitude
in
place
of
all
that
brisk
and
breezy
life
i
went
swiftly
back
saying
not
a
word
to
anybody
i
told
sandy
this
ghastly
news
we
could
imagine
no
explanation
that
would
begin
to
explain
had
there
been
an
invasion
an
earthquake
a
pestilence
had
the
nation
been
swept
out
of
existence
but
guessing
was
profitless
i
must
goat

i
borrowed

no
bigger
than
a
steam
launchand
was
soon
ready
the
partingah
yes
that
was
hard
as
i
was
devouring
the
child
with
last
kisses
it
brisked
up
and
jabbered
out
its
vocabulary
the
first
time
in
more
than
two
weeks
and
it
made
fools
of
us
for
joy
the
darling
mispronunciations
of
childhooddear
me
theres
no
music
that
can
touch
it
and
how
one
grieves
when
it
wastes
away
and
dissolves
into
correctness
knowing
it
will
never
visit
his
bereaved
ear
again
well
how
good
it
was
to
be
able
to
carry
that
gracious
memory
away
with
me
i
approached
england
the
next
morning
with
the
wide
highway
of
salt
water
all
to
myself
there
were
ships
in
the
harbor
at
dover
but
they
were
naked
as
to
sails
and
there
was
no
sign
of
life
about
them
it
was
sunday
yet
at
canterbury
the
streets
were
empty
strangest
of
all
there
was
not
even
a
priest
in
sight
and
no
stroke
of
a
bell
fell
upon
my
ear
the
mournfulness
of
death
was
everywhere
i
couldnt
understand
it
at
last
in
the
further
edge
of
that
town
i
saw
a
small
funeral
procession
just
a
family
and
a
few
friends
following
a
coffinno
priest
a
funeral
without
bell
book
or
candle
there
was
a
church
there
close
at
hand
but
they
passed
it
by
weeping
and
did
not
enter
it
i
glanced
up
at
the
belfry
and
there
hung
the
bell
shrouded
in
black
and
its
tongue
tied
back
now
i
knew
now
i
understood
the
stupendous
calamity
that
had
overtaken
england
invasion
invasion
is
a
triviality
to
it
it
was
the
interdict
i
asked
no
questions
i
didnt
need
to
ask
any
the
church
had
struck
the
thing
for
me
to
do
was
to
get
into
a
disguise
and
go
warily
one
of
my
servants
gave
me
a
suit
of
clothes
and
when
we
were
safe
beyond
the
town
i
put
them
on
and
from
that
time
i
traveled
alone
i
could
not
risk
the
embarrassment
of
company
a
miserable
journey
a
desolate
silence
everywhere
even
in
london
itself
traffic
had
ceased
men
did
not
talk
or
laugh
or
go
in
groups
or
even
in
couples
they
moved
aimlessly
about
each
man
by
himself
with
his
head
down
and
woe
and
terror
at
his
heart
the
tower
showed
recent
warscars
verily
much
had
been
happening
of
course
i
meant
to
take
the
train
for
camelot
train
why
the
station
was
as
vacant
as
a
cavern
i
moved
on
the
journey
to
camelot
was
a
repetition
of
what
i
had
already
seen
the
monday
and
the
tuesday
differed
in
no
way
from
the
sunday
i
arrived
far
in
the
night
from
being
the
best
electriclighted
town
in
the
kingdom
and
the
most
like
a
recumbent
sun
of
anything
you
ever
saw
it
was
become
simply
a
blota
blot
upon
darknessthat
is
to
say
it
was
darker
and
solider
than
the
rest
of
the
darkness
and
so
you
could
see
it
a
little
better
it
made
me
feel
as
if
maybe
it
was
symbolicala
sort
of
sign
that
the
church
was
going
to
keep
the
upper
hand
now
and
snuff
out
all
my
beautiful
civilization
just
like
that
i
found
no
life
stirring
in
the
somber
streets
i
groped
my
way
with
a
heavy
heart
the
vast
castle
loomed
black
upon
the
hilltop
not
a
spark
visible
about
it
the
drawbridge
was
down
the
great
gate
stood
wide
i
entered
without
challenge
my
own
heels
making
the
only
sound
i
heardand
it
was
sepulchral
enough
in
those
huge
vacant
courts
chapter
xlii
war
i
found
clarence
alone
in
his
quarters
drowned
in
melancholy
and
in
place
of
the
electric
light
he
had
reinstituted
the
ancient
raglamp
and
sat
there
in
a
grisly
twilight
with
all
curtains
drawn
tight
he
sprang
up
and
rushed
for
me
eagerly
saying
oh
its
worth
a
billion
milrays
to
look
upon
a
live
person
again
he
knew
me
as
easily
as
if
i
hadnt
been
disguised
at
all
which
frightened
me
one
may
easily
believe
that
quick
now
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
fearful
disaster
i
said
how
did
it
come
about
well
if
there
hadnt
been
any
queen
guenever
it
wouldnt
have
come
so
early
but
it
would
have
come
anyway
it
would
have
come
on
your
own
account
by
and
by
by
luck
it
happened
to
come
on
the
queens
and
sir
launcelots
just
so
give
me
the
details
i
reckon
you
will
grant
that
during
some
years
there
has
been
only
one
pair
of
eyes
in
these
kingdoms
that
has
not
been
looking
steadily
askance
at
the
queen
and
sir
launcelot
yes
king
arthurs
and
only
one
heart
that
was
without
suspicion
yesthe
kings
a
heart
that
isnt
capable
of
thinking
evil
of
a
friend
well
the
king
might
have
gone
on
still
happy
and
unsuspecting
to
the
end
of
his
days
but
for
one
of
your
modern
improvements
the
stockboard
when
you
left
three
miles
of
the
london
canterbury
and
dover
were
ready
for
the
rails
and
also
ready
and
ripe
for
manipulation
in
the
stockmarket
it
was
wildcat
and
everybody
knew
it
the
stock
was
for
sale
at
a
giveaway
what
does
sir
launcelot
do
but
yes
i
know
he
quietly
picked
up
nearly
all
of
it
for
a
song
then
he
bought
about
twice
as
much
more
deliverable
upon
call
and
he
was
about
to
call
when
i
left
very
well
he
did
call
the
boys
couldnt
deliver
oh
he
had
themand
he
just
settled
his
grip
and
squeezed
them
they
were
laughing
in
their
sleeves
over
their
smartness
in
selling
stock
to
him
at
15
and
16
and
along
there
that
wasnt
worth
10
well
when
they
had
laughed
long
enough
on
that
side
of
their
mouths
they
restedup
that
side
by
shifting
the
laugh
to
the
other
side
that
was
when
they
compromised
with
the
invincible
at
283
good
land
he
skinned
them
alive
and
they
deserved
itanyway

it
was
an
accident
they
were
simply
onlookers
they
were
unarmed
and
were
merely
there
to
witness
the
queens
punishment
sir

smote
down

incalculable
go
on
well
the
rest

is
just
war
pure
and
simple
launcelot
retreated
to
his
town
and
castle
of
joyous
gard
and
gathered
there
a
great
following
of
knights
the
king
with
a
great
host
went
there
and
there
was
desperate
fighting
during
several
days
and
as
a
result
all
the
plain
around
was
paved
with
corpses
and
castiron
then
the
church
patched
up
a
peace
between
arthur
and
launcelot
and
the
queen
and
everybodyeverybody
but
sir
gawaine
he
was
bitter
about
the
slaying
of
his
brothers
gareth
and
gaheris
and
would
not
be
appeased
he
notified
launcelot
to
get
him
thence
and
make
swift
preparation
and
look
to
be
soon
attacked
so
launcelot
sailed
to
his
duchy
of
guienne
with
his
following
and
gawaine
soon
followed
with
an
army
and
he
beguiled
arthur
to
go
with
him
arthur
left
the
kingdom
in
sir
mordreds
hands
until
you
should
return
aha
kings
customary
wisdom
yes
sir
mordred
set
himself
at
once
to
work
to
make
his
kingship
permanent
he
was
going
to
marry
guenever
as
a
first
move
but
she
fled
and
shut
herself
up
in
the
tower
of
london
mordred
attacked
the
bishop
of
canterbury
dropped
down
on
him
with
the
interdict
the
king
returned
mordred
fought
him
at
dover
at
canterbury
and
again
at
barham
down
then
there
was
talk
of
peace
and
a
composition
terms
mordred
to
have
cornwall
and
kent
during
arthurs
life
and
the
whole
kingdom
afterward
well
upon
my
word
my
dream
of
a
republic
to
be
a
dream
and
so
remain
yes
the
two
armies
lay
near
salisbury
gawainegawaines

at
dover
castle
he
fell
in
the
fight
theregawaine
appeared
to
arthur
in
a
dream
at
least
his
ghost
did
and
warned
him
to
refrain
from
conflict
for
a
month
let
the
delay
cost
what
it
might
but
battle
was
precipitated
by
an
accident
arthur
had
given
order
that
if
a
sword
was
raised
during
the
consultation
over
the
proposed
treaty
with
mordred
sound
the
trumpet
and
fall
on
for
he
had
no
confidence
in
mordred
mordred
had
given
a
similar
order
to
his
people
well
by
and
by
an
adder
bit
a
knights
heel
the
knight
forgot
all
about
the
order
and
made
a
slash
at
the
adder
with
his
sword
inside
of
half
a
minute
those
two
prodigious
hosts
came
together
with
a
crash
they
butchered
away
all
day
then
the
kinghowever
we
have
started
something
fresh
since
you
leftour
paper
has
no
what
is
that
war
correspondence
why
thats
good
yes
the
paper
was
booming
right
along
for
the
interdict
made
no
impression
got
no
grip
while
the
war
lasted
i
had
war
correspondents
with
both
armies
i
will
finish
that
battle
by
reading
you
what
one
of
the
boys
says
then
the
king
looked
about
him
and
then
was
he
ware
of
all
his
host
and
of
all
his
good
knights
were
left
no
more
on
live
but
two
knights
that
was
sir
lucan
de
butlere
and
his
brother
sir
bedivere
and
they
were
full
sore
wounded
jesu
mercy
said
the
king
where
are
all
my
noble
knights
becomen
alas
that
ever
i
should
see
this
doleful
day
for
now
said
arthur
i
am
come
to
mine
end
but
would
to
god
that
i
wist
where
were
that
traitor
sir
mordred
that
hath
caused
all
this
mischief
then
was
king
arthur
ware
where
sir
mordred
leaned
upon
his
sword
among
a
great
heap
of
dead
men
now
give
me
my
spear
said
arthur
unto
sir
lucan
for
yonder
i
have
espied
the
traitor
that
all
this
woe
hath
wrought
sir
let
him
be
said
sir
lucan
for
he
is
unhappy
and
if
ye
pass
this
unhappy
day
ye
shall
be
right
well
revenged
upon
him
good
lord
remember
ye
of
your
nights
dream
and
what
the
spirit
of
sir
gawaine
told
you
this
night
yet
god
of
his
great
goodness
hath
preserved
you
hitherto
therefore
for
gods
sake
my
lord
leave
off
by
this
for
blessed
be
god
ye
have
won
the
field
for
here
we
be
three
on
live
and
with
sir
mordred
is
none
on
live
and
if
ye
leave
off
now
this
wicked
day
of
destiny
is
past
tide
me
death
betide
me
life
saith
the
king
now
i
see
him
yonder
alone
he
shall
never
escape
mine
hands
for
at
a
better
avail
shall
i
never
have
him
god
speed
you
well
said
sir
bedivere
then
the
king
gat
his
spear
in
both
his
hands
and
ran
toward
sir
mordred
crying
traitor
now
is
thy
death
day
come
and
when
sir
mordred
heard
sir
arthur
he
ran
until
him
with
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand
and
then
king
arthur
smote
sir
mordred
under
the
shield
with
a
foin
of
his
spear
throughout
the
body
more
than
a
fathom
and
when
sir
mordred
felt
that
he
had
his
deaths
wound
he
thrust
himself
with
the
might
that
he
had
up
to
the
butt
of
king
arthurs
spear
and
right
so
he
smote
his
father
arthur
with
his
sword
holden
in
both
his
hands
on
the
side
of
the
head
that
the
sword
pierced
the
helmet
and
the
brainpan
and
therewithal
sir
mordred
fell
stark
dead
to
the
earth
and
the
noble
arthur
fell
in
a
swoon
to
the
earth
and
there
he
swooned
ofttimes
that
is
a
good
piece
of
war
correspondence
clarence
you
are
a
firstrate
newspaper
man
wellis
the
king
all
right
did
he
get
well
poor
soul
no
he
is
dead
i
was
utterly
stunned
it
had
not
seemed
to
me
that
any
wound
could
be
mortal
to
him
and
the
queen
clarence
she
is
a
nun
in
almesbury
what
changes
and
in
such
a
short
while
it
is
inconceivable
what
next
i
wonder
i
can
tell
you
what
next
well
stake
our
lives
and
stand
by
them
what
do
you
mean
by
that
the
church
is
master
now
the
interdict
included
you
with
mordred
it
is
not
to
be
removed
while
you
remain
alive
the
clans
are
gathering
the
church
has
gathered
all
the
knights
that
are
left
alive
and
as
soon
as
you
are
discovered
we
shall
have
business
on
our
hands
stuff
with
our
deadly
scientific
warmaterial
with
our
hosts
of
trained
save
your
breathwe
havent
sixty
faithful
left
what
are
you
saying
our
schools
our
colleges
our
vast
workshops
our
when
those
knights
come
those
establishments
will
empty
themselves
and
go
over
to
the
enemy
did
you
think
you
had
educated
the
superstition
out
of
those
people
i
certainly
did
think
it
well
then
you
may
unthink
it
they
stood
every
strain
easily
until
the
interdict
since
then
they
merely
put
on
a
bold
outsideat
heart
they
are
quaking
make
up
your
mind
to
it
when
the
armies
come
the
mask
will
fall
its
hard
news
we
are
lost
they
will
turn
our
own
science
against
us
no
they
wont
why
because
i
and
a
handful
of
the
faithful
have
blocked
that
game
ill
tell
you
what
ive
done
and
what
moved
me
to
it
smart
as
you
are
the
church
was
smarter
it
was
the
church
that
sent
you
cruisingthrough
her
servants
the
doctors
clarence
it
is
the
truth
i
know
it
every
officer
of
your
ship
was
the
churchs
picked
servant
and
so
was
every
man
of
the
crew
oh
come
it
is
just
as
i
tell
you
i
did
not
find
out
these
things
at
once
but
i
found
them
out
finally
did
you
send
me
verbal
information
by
the
commander
of
the
ship
to
the
effect
that
upon
his
return
to
you
with
supplies
you
were
going
to
leave
cadiz
cadiz
i
havent
been
at
cadiz
at
all
going
to
leave
cadiz
and
cruise
in
distant
seas
indefinitely
for
the
health
of
your
family
did
you
send
me
that
word
of
course
not
i
would
have
written
wouldnt
i
naturally
i
was
troubled
and
suspicious
when
the
commander
sailed
again
i
managed
to
ship
a
spy
with
him
i
have
never
heard
of
vessel
or
spy
since
i
gave
myself
two
weeks
to
hear
from
you
in
then
i
resolved
to
send
a
ship
to
cadiz
there
was
a
reason
why
i
didnt
what
was
that
our
navy
had
suddenly
and
mysteriously
disappeared
also
as
suddenly
and
as
mysteriously
the
railway
and
telegraph
and
telephone
service
ceased
the
men
all
deserted
poles
were
cut
down
the
church
laid
a
ban
upon
the
electric
light
i
had
to
be
up
and
doingand
straight
off
your
life
was
safenobody
in
these
kingdoms
but
merlin
would
venture
to
touch
such
a
magician
as
you
without
ten
thousand
men
at
his
backi
had
nothing
to
think
of
but
how
to
put
preparations
in
the
best
trim
against
your
coming
i
felt
safe
myselfnobody
would
be
anxious
to
touch
a
pet
of
yours
so
this
is
what
i
did
from
our
various
works
i
selected
all
the
menboys
i
meanwhose
faithfulness
under
whatsoever
pressure
i
could
swear
to
and
i
called
them
together
secretly
and
gave
them
their
instructions
there
are
fiftytwo
of
them
none
younger
than
fourteen
and
none
above
seventeen
years
old
why
did
you
select
boys
because
all
the
others
were
born
in
an
atmosphere
of
superstition
and
reared
in
it
it
is
in
their
blood
and
bones
we
imagined
we
had
educated
it
out
of
them
they
thought
so
too
the
interdict
woke
them
up
like
a
thunderclap
it
revealed
them
to
themselves
and
it
revealed
them
to
me
too
with
boys
it
was
different
such
as
have
been
under
our
training
from
seven
to
ten
years
have
had
no
acquaintance
with
the
churchs
terrors
and
it
was
among
these
that
i
found
my
fiftytwo
as
a
next
move
i
paid
a
private
visit
to
that
old
cave
of
merlinsnot
the
small
onethe
big
one
yes
the
one
where
we
secretly
established
our
first
great
electric
plant
when
i
was
projecting
a
miracle
just
so
and
as
that
miracle
hadnt
become
necessary
then
i
thought
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
utilize
the
plant
now
ive
provisioned
the
cave
for
a
siege
a
good
idea
a
firstrate
idea
i
think
so
i
placed
four
of
my
boys
there
as
a
guardinside
and
out
of
sight
nobody
was
to
be
hurtwhile
outside
but
any
attempt
to
enterwell
we
said
just
let
anybody
try
it
then
i
went
out
into
the
hills
and
uncovered
and
cut
the
secret
wires
which
connected
your
bedroom
with
the
wires
that
go
to
the
dynamite
deposits
under
all
our
vast
factories
mills
workshops
magazines
etc
and
about
midnight
i
and
my
boys
turned
out
and
connected
that
wire
with
the
cave
and
nobody
but
you
and
i
suspects
where
the
other
end
of
it
goes
to
we
laid
it
under
ground
of
course
and
it
was
all
finished
in
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
we
shant
have
to
leave
our
fortress
now
when
we
want
to
blow
up
our
civilization
it
was
the
right
moveand
the
natural
one
military
necessity
in
the
changed
condition
of
things
well
what
changes
have
come
we
expected
to
be
besieged
in
the
palace
some
time
or
other
but
however
go
on
next
we
built
a
wire
fence
wire
fence
yes
you
dropped
the
hint
of
it
yourself
two
or
three
years
ago
oh
i
rememberthe
time
the
church
tried
her
strength
against
us
the
first
time
and
presently
thought
it
wise
to
wait
for
a
hopefuler
season
well
how
have
you
arranged
the
fence
i
start
twelve
immensely
strong
wiresnaked
not
insulated
from
a
big
dynamo
in
the
cavedynamo
with
no
brushes
except
a
positive
and
a
negative
one
yes
thats
right
the
wires
go
out
from
the
cave
and
fence
in
a
circle
of
level
ground
a
hundred
yards
in
diameter
they
make
twelve
independent
fences
ten
feet
apartthat
is
to
say
twelve
circles
within
circlesand
their
ends
come
into
the
cave
again
right
go
on
the
fences
are
fastened
to
heavy
oaken
posts
only
three
feet
apart
and
these
posts
are
sunk
five
feet
in
the
ground
that
is
good
and
strong
yes
the
wires
have
no
groundconnection
outside
of
the
cave
they
go
out
from
the
positive
brush
of
the
dynamo
there
is
a
groundconnection
through
the
negative
brush
the
other
ends
of
the
wire
return
to
the
cave
and
each
is
grounded
independently
no
no
that
wont
do
why
its
too
expensiveuses
up
force
for
nothing
you
dont
want
any
groundconnection
except
the
one
through
the
negative
brush
the
other
end
of
every
wire
must
be
brought
back
into
the
cave
and
fastened
independently
and
without
any
groundconnection
now
then
observe
the
economy
of
it
a
cavalry
charge
hurls
itself
against
the
fence
you
are
using
no
power
you
are
spending
no
money
for
there
is
only
one
groundconnection
till
those
horses
come
against
the
wire
the
moment
they
touch
it
they
form
a
connection
with
the
negative
brush
through
the
ground
and
drop
dead
dont
you
seeyou
are
using
no
energy
until
it
is
needed
your
lightning
is
there
and
ready
like
the
load
in
a
gun
but
it
isnt
costing
you
a
cent
till
you
touch
it
off
oh
yes
the
single
groundconnection
of
course
i
dont
know
how
i
overlooked
that
its
not
only
cheaper
but
its
more
effectual
than
the
other
way
for
if
wires
break
or
get
tangled
no
harm
is
done
no
especially
if
we
have
a
telltale
in
the
cave
and
disconnect
the
broken
wire
well
go
on
the
gatlings
yesthats
arranged
in
the
center
of
the
inner
circle
on
a
spacious
platform
six
feet
high
ive
grouped
a
battery
of
thirteen
gatling
guns
and
provided
plenty
of
ammunition
thats
it
they
command
every
approach
and
when
the
churchs
knights
arrive
theres
going
to
be
music
the
brow
of
the
precipice
over
the
cave
ive
got
a
wire
fence
there
and
a
gatling
they
wont
drop
any
rocks
down
on
us
well
and
the
glasscylinder
dynamite
torpedoes
thats
attended
to
its
the
prettiest
garden
that
was
ever
planted
its
a
belt
forty
feet
wide
and
goes
around
the
outer
fencedistance
between
it
and
the
fence
one
hundred
yardskind
of
neutral
ground
that
space
is
there
isnt
a
single
square
yard
of
that
whole
belt
but
is
equipped
with
a
torpedo
we
laid
them
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
sprinkled
a
layer
of
sand
over
them
its
an
innocent
looking
garden
but
you
let
a
man
start
in
to
hoe
it
once
and
youll
see
you
tested
the
torpedoes
well
i
was
going
to
but
but
what
why
its
an
immense
oversight
not
to
apply
a
test
yes
i
know
but
theyre
all
right
i
laid
a
few
in
the
public
road
beyond
our
lines
and
theyve
been
tested
oh
that
alters
the
case
who
did
it
a
church
committee
how
kind
yes
they
came
to
command
us
to
make
submission
you
see
they
didnt
really
come
to
test
the
torpedoes
that
was
merely
an
incident
did
the
committee
make
a
report
yes
they
made
one
you
could
have
heard
it
a
mile
unanimous
that
was
the
nature
of
it
after
that
i
put
up
some
signs
for
the
protection
of
future
committees
and
we
have
had
no
intruders
since
clarence
youve
done
a
world
of
work
and
done
it
perfectly
we
had
plenty
of
time
for
it
there
wasnt
any
occasion
for
hurry
we
sat
silent
awhile
thinking
then
my
mind
was
made
up
and
i
said
yes
everything
is
ready
everything
is
shipshape
no
detail
is
wanting
i
know
what
to
do
now
so
do
i
sit
down
and
wait
no
sir
rise
up
and
strike
do
you
mean
it
yes
indeed
the
defensive
isnt
in
my
line
and
the
offensive
is
that
is
when
i
hold
a
fair
handtwothirds
as
good
a
hand
as
the
enemy
oh
yes
well
rise
up
and
strike
thats
our
game
a
hundred
to
one
you
are
right
when
does
the
performance
begin
now
well
proclaim
the
republic
well
that
will
precipitate
things
sure
enough
it
will
make
them
buzz
i
tell
you
england
will
be
a
hornets
nest
before
noon
tomorrow
if
the
churchs
hand
hasnt
lost
its
cunningand
we
know
it
hasnt
now
you
write
and
ill
dictate
thus
proclamation
be
it
known
unto
all
whereas
the
king
having
died
and
left
no
heir
it
becomes
my
duty
to
continue
the
executive
authority
vested
in
me
until
a
government
shall
have
been
created
and
set
in
motion
the
monarchy
has
lapsed
it
no
longer
exists
by
consequence
all
political
power
has
reverted
to
its
original
source
the
people
of
the
nation
with
the
monarchy
its
several
adjuncts
died
also
wherefore
there
is
no
longer
a
nobility
no
longer
a
privileged
class
no
longer
an
established
church
all
men
are
become
exactly
equal
they
are
upon
one
common
level
and
religion
is
free
a
republic
is
hereby
proclaimed
as
being
the
natural
estate
of
a
nation
when
other
authority
has
ceased
it
is
the
duty
of
the
british
people
to
meet
together
immediately
and
by
their
votes
elect
representatives
and
deliver
into
their
hands
the
government
i
signed
it
the
boss
and
dated
it
from
merlins
cave
clarence
said
why
that
tells
where
we
are
and
invites
them
to
call
right
away
that
is
the
idea
we
strikeby
the
proclamationthen
its
their
innings
now
have
the
thing
set
up
and
printed
and
posted
right
off
that
is
give
the
order
then
if
youve
got
a
couple
of
bicycles
handy
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
ho
for
merlins
cave
i
shall
be
ready
in
ten
minutes
what
a
cyclone
there
is
going
to
be
tomorrow
when
this
piece
of
paper
gets
to
work
its
a
pleasant
old
palace
this
is
i
wonder
if
we
shall
ever
again
but
never
mind
about
that
chapter
xliii
the
battle
of
the
sand
belt
in
merlins
caveclarence
and
i
and
fiftytwo
fresh
bright
welleducated
cleanminded
young
british
boys
at
dawn
i
sent
an
order
to
the
factories
and
to
all
our
great
works
to
stop
operations
and
remove
all
life
to
a
safe
distance
as
everything
was
going
to
be
blown
up
by
secret
mines
and
no
telling
at
what
momenttherefore
vacate
at
once
these
people
knew
me
and
had
confidence
in
my
word
they
would
clear
out
without
waiting
to
part
their
hair
and
i
could
take
my
own
time
about
dating
the
explosion
you
couldnt
hire
one
of
them
to
go
back
during
the
century
if
the
explosion
was
still
impending
we
had
a
week
of
waiting
it
was
not
dull
for
me
because
i
was
writing
all
the
time
during
the
first
three
days
i
finished
turning
my
old
diary
into
this
narrative
form
it
only
required
a
chapter
or
so
to
bring
it
down
to
date
the
rest
of
the
week
i
took
up
in
writing
letters
to
my
wife
it
was
always
my
habit
to
write
to
sandy
every
day
whenever
we
were
separate
and
now
i
kept
up
the
habit
for
love
of
it
and
of
her
though
i
couldnt
do
anything
with
the
letters
of
course
after
i
had
written
them
but
it
put
in
the
time
you
see
and
was
almost
like
talking
it
was
almost
as
if
i
was
saying
sandy
if
you
and
hellocentral
were
here
in
the
cave
instead
of
only
your
photographs
what
good
times
we
could
have
and
then
you
know
i
could
imagine
the
baby
googooing
something
out
in
reply
with
its
fists
in
its
mouth
and
itself
stretched
across
its
mothers
lap
on
its
back
and
she
alaughing
and
admiring
and
worshipping
and
now
and
then
tickling
under
the
babys
chin
to
set
it
cackling
and
then
maybe
throwing
in
a
word
of
answer
to
me
herselfand
so
on
and
so
on
well
dont
you
know
i
could
sit
there
in
the
cave
with
my
pen
and
keep
it
up
that
way
by
the
hour
with
them
why
it
was
almost
like
having
us
all
together
again
i
had
spies
out
every
night
of
course
to
get
news
every
report
made
things
look
more
and
more
impressive
the
hosts
were
gathering
gathering
down
all
the
roads
and
paths
of
england
the
knights
were
riding
and
priests
rode
with
them
to
hearten
these
original
crusaders
this
being
the
churchs
war
all
the
nobilities
big
and
little
were
on
their
way
and
all
the
gentry
this
was
all
as
was
expected
we
should
thin
out
this
sort
of
folk
to
such
a
degree
that
the
people
would
have
nothing
to
do
but
just
step
to
the
front
with
their
republic
and
ah
what
a
donkey
i
was
toward
the
end
of
the
week
i
began
to
get
this
large
and
disenchanting
fact
through
my
head
that
the
mass
of
the
nation
had
swung
their
caps
and
shouted
for
the
republic
for
about
one
day
and
there
an
end
the
church
the
nobles
and
the
gentry
then
turned
one
grand
alldisapproving
frown
upon
them
and
shriveled
them
into
sheep
from
that
moment
the
sheep
had
begun
to
gather
to
the
foldthat
is
to
say
the
campsand
offer
their
valueless
lives
and
their
valuable
wool
to
the
righteous
cause
why
even
the
very
men
who
had
lately
been
slaves
were
in
the
righteous
cause
and
glorifying
it
praying
for
it
sentimentally
slabbering
over
it
just
like
all
the
other
commoners
imagine
such
human
muck
as
this
conceive
of
this
folly
yes
it
was
now
death
to
the
republic
everywherenot
a
dissenting
voice
all
england
was
marching
against
us
truly
this
was
more
than
i
had
bargained
for
i
watched
my
fiftytwo
boys
narrowly
watched
their
faces
their
walk
their
unconscious
attitudes
for
all
these
are
a
language
a
language
given
us
purposely
that
it
may
betray
us
in
times
of
emergency
when
we
have
secrets
which
we
want
to
keep
i
knew
that
that
thought
would
keep
saying
itself
over
and
over
again
in
their
minds
and
hearts
all
england
is
marching
against
us
and
ever
more
strenuously
imploring
attention
with
each
repetition
ever
more
sharply
realizing
itself
to
their
imaginations
until
even
in
their
sleep
they
would
find
no
rest
from
it
but
hear
the
vague
and
flitting
creatures
of
the
dreams
say
all
england
all
englandis
marching
against
you
i
knew
all
this
would
happen
i
knew
that
ultimately
the
pressure
would
become
so
great
that
it
would
compel
utterance
therefore
i
must
be
ready
with
an
answer
at
that
timean
answer
well
chosen
and
tranquilizing
i
was
right
the
time
came
they
had
to
speak
poor
lads
it
was
pitiful
to
see
they
were
so
pale
so
worn
so
troubled
at
first
their
spokesman
could
hardly
find
voice
or
words
but
he
presently
got
both
this
is
what
he
saidand
he
put
it
in
the
neat
modern
english
taught
him
in
my
schools
we
have
tried
to
forget
what
we
areenglish
boys
we
have
tried
to
put
reason
before
sentiment
duty
before
love
our
minds
approve
but
our
hearts
reproach
us
while
apparently
it
was
only
the
nobility
only
the
gentry
only
the
twentyfive
or
thirty
thousand
knights
left
alive
out
of
the
late
wars
we
were
of
one
mind
and
undisturbed
by
any
troubling
doubt
each
and
every
one
of
these
fiftytwo
lads
who
stand
here
before
you
said
they
have
chosenit
is
their
affair
but
thinkthe
matter
is
alteredall
england
is
marching
against
us
oh
sir
consider
reflectthese
people
are
our
people
they
are
bone
of
our
bone
flesh
of
our
flesh
we
love
themdo
not
ask
us
to
destroy
our
nation
well
it
shows
the
value
of
looking
ahead
and
being
ready
for
a
thing
when
it
happens
if
i
hadnt
foreseen
this
thing
and
been
fixed
that
boy
would
have
had
mei
couldnt
have
said
a
word
but
i
was
fixed
i
said
my
boys
your
hearts
are
in
the
right
place
you
have
thought
the
worthy
thought
you
have
done
the
worthy
thing
you
are
english
boys
you
will
remain
english
boys
and
you
will
keep
that
name
unsmirched
give
yourselves
no
further
concern
let
your
minds
be
at
peace
consider
this
while
all
england
is
marching
against
us
who
is
in
the
van
who
by
the
commonest
rules
of
war
will
march
in
the
front
answer
me
the
mounted
host
of
mailed
knights
true
they
are
thirty
thousand
strong
acres
deep
they
will
march
now
observe
none
but
they
will
ever
strike
the
sandbelt
then
there
will
be
an
episode
immediately
after
the
civilian
multitude
in
the
rear
will
retire
to
meet
business
engagements
elsewhere
none
but
nobles
and
gentry
are
knights
and
none
but
these
will
remain
to
dance
to
our
music
after
that
episode
it
is
absolutely
true
that
we
shall
have
to
fight
nobody
but
these
thirty
thousand
knights
now
speak
and
it
shall
be
as
you
decide
shall
we
avoid
the
battle
retire
from
the
field
no
the
shout
was
unanimous
and
hearty
are
youare
youwell
afraid
of
these
thirty
thousand
knights
that
joke
brought
out
a
good
laugh
the
boys
troubles
vanished
away
and
they
went
gaily
to
their
posts
ah
they
were
a
darling
fiftytwo
as
pretty
as
girls
too
i
was
ready
for
the
enemy
now
let
the
approaching
big
day
come
alongit
would
find
us
on
deck
the
big
day
arrived
on
time
at
dawn
the
sentry
on
watch
in
the
corral
came
into
the
cave
and
reported
a
moving
black
mass
under
the
horizon
and
a
faint
sound
which
he
thought
to
be
military
music
breakfast
was
just
ready
we
sat
down
and
ate
it
this
over
i
made
the
boys
a
little
speech
and
then
sent
out
a
detail
to
man
the
battery
with
clarence
in
command
of
it
the
sun
rose
presently
and
sent
its
unobstructed
splendors
over
the
land
and
we
saw
a
prodigious
host
moving
slowly
toward
us
with
the
steady
drift
and
aligned
front
of
a
wave
of
the
sea
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
and
more
and
more
sublimely
imposing
became
its
aspect
yes
all
england
was
there
apparently
soon
we
could
see
the
innumerable
banners
fluttering
and
then
the
sun
struck
the
sea
of
armor
and
set
it
all
aflash
yes
it
was
a
fine
sight
i
hadnt
ever
seen
anything
to
beat
it
at
last
we
could
make
out
details
all
the
front
ranks
no
telling
how
many
acres
deep
were
horsemenplumed
knights
in
armor
suddenly
we
heard
the
blare
of
trumpets
the
slow
walk
burst
into
a
gallop
and
thenwell
it
was
wonderful
to
see
down
swept
that
vast
horseshoe
waveit
approached
the
sandbeltmy
breath
stood
still
nearer
nearerthe
strip
of
green
turf
beyond
the
yellow
belt
grew
narrownarrower
stillbecame
a
mere
ribbon
in
front
of
the
horsesthen
disappeared
under
their
hoofs
great
scott
why
the
whole
front
of
that
host
shot
into
the
sky
with
a
thundercrash
and
became
a
whirling
tempest
of
rags
and
fragments
and
along
the
ground
lay
a
thick
wall
of
smoke
that
hid
what
was
left
of
the
multitude
from
our
sight
time
for
the
second
step
in
the
plan
of
campaign
i
touched
a
button
and
shook
the
bones
of
england
loose
from
her
spine
in
that
explosion
all
our
noble
civilizationfactories
went
up
in
the
air
and
disappeared
from
the
earth
it
was
a
pity
but
it
was
necessary
we
could
not
afford
to
let
the
enemy
turn
our
own
weapons
against
us
now
ensued
one
of
the
dullest
quarterhours
i
had
ever
endured
we
waited
in
a
silent
solitude
enclosed
by
our
circles
of
wire
and
by
a
circle
of
heavy
smoke
outside
of
these
we
couldnt
see
over
the
wall
of
smoke
and
we
couldnt
see
through
it
but
at
last
it
began
to
shred
away
lazily
and
by
the
end
of
another
quarterhour
the
land
was
clear
and
our
curiosity
was
enabled
to
satisfy
itself
no
living
creature
was
in
sight
we
now
perceived
that
additions
had
been
made
to
our
defenses
the
dynamite
had
dug
a
ditch
more
than
a
hundred
feet
wide
all
around
us
and
cast
up
an
embankment
some
twentyfive
feet
high
on
both
borders
of
it
as
to
destruction
of
life
it
was
amazing
moreover
it
was
beyond
estimate
of
course
we
could
not
count
the
dead
because
they
did
not
exist
as
individuals
but
merely
as
homogeneous
protoplasm
with
alloys
of
iron
and
buttons
no
life
was
in
sight
but
necessarily
there
must
have
been
some
wounded
in
the
rear
ranks
who
were
carried
off
the
field
under
cover
of
the
wall
of
smoke
there
would
be
sickness
among
the
othersthere
always
is
after
an
episode
like
that
but
there
would
be
no
reinforcements
this
was
the
last
stand
of
the
chivalry
of
england
it
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
order
after
the
recent
annihilating
wars
so
i
felt
quite
safe
in
believing
that
the
utmost
force
that
could
for
the
future
be
brought
against
us
would
be
but
small
that
is
of
knights
i
therefore
issued
a
congratulatory
proclamation
to
my
army
in
these
words
soldiers
champions
of
human
liberty
and
equality
your
general
congratulates
you
in
the
pride
of
his
strength
and
the
vanity
of
his
renown
an
arrogant
enemy
came
against
you
you
were
ready
the
conflict
was
brief
on
your
side
glorious
this
mighty
victory
having
been
achieved
utterly
without
loss
stands
without
example
in
history
so
long
as
the
planets
shall
continue
to
move
in
their
orbits
the
battle
of
the
sandbelt
will
not
perish
out
of
the
memories
of
men
the
boss
i
read
it
well
and
the
applause
i
got
was
very
gratifying
to
me
i
then
wound
up
with
these
remarks
the
war
with
the
english
nation
as
a
nation
is
at
an
end
the
nation
has
retired
from
the
field
and
the
war
before
it
can
be
persuaded
to
return
war
will
have
ceased
this
campaign
is
the
only
one
that
is
going
to
be
fought
it
will
be
brief
the
briefest
in
history
also
the
most
destructive
to
life
considered
from
the
standpoint
of
proportion
of
casualties
to
numbers
engaged
we
are
done
with
the
nation
henceforth
we
deal
only
with
the
knights
english
knights
can
be
killed
but
they
cannot
be
conquered
we
know
what
is
before
us
while
one
of
these
men
remains
alive
our
task
is
not
finished
the
war
is
not
ended
we
will
kill
them
all
loud
and
long
continued
applause
i
picketed
the
great
embankments
thrown
up
around
our
lines
by
the
dynamite
explosionmerely
a
lookout
of
a
couple
of
boys
to
announce
the
enemy
when
he
should
appear
again
next
i
sent
an
engineer
and
forty
men
to
a
point
just
beyond
our
lines
on
the
south
to
turn
a
mountain
brook
that
was
there
and
bring
it
within
our
lines
and
under
our
command
arranging
it
in
such
a
way
that
i
could
make
instant
use
of
it
in
an
emergency
the
forty
men
were
divided
into
two
shifts
of
twenty
each
and
were
to
relieve
each
other
every
two
hours
in
ten
hours
the
work
was
accomplished
it
was
nightfall
now
and
i
withdrew
my
pickets
the
one
who
had
had
the
northern
outlook
reported
a
camp
in
sight
but
visible
with
the
glass
only
he
also
reported
that
a
few
knights
had
been
feeling
their
way
toward
us
and
had
driven
some
cattle
across
our
lines
but
that
the
knights
themselves
had
not
come
very
near
that
was
what
i
had
been
expecting
they
were
feeling
us
you
see
they
wanted
to
know
if
we
were
going
to
play
that
red
terror
on
them
again
they
would
grow
bolder
in
the
night
perhaps
i
believed
i
knew
what
project
they
would
attempt
because
it
was
plainly
the
thing
i
would
attempt
myself
if
i
were
in
their
places
and
as
ignorant
as
they
were
i
mentioned
it
to
clarence
i
think
you
are
right
said
he
it
is
the
obvious
thing
for
them
to
try
well
then
i
said
if
they
do
it
they
are
doomed
certainly
they
wont
have
the
slightest
show
in
the
world
of
course
they
wont
its
dreadful
clarence
it
seems
an
awful
pity
the
thing
disturbed
me
so
that
i
couldnt
get
any
peace
of
mind
for
thinking
of
it
and
worrying
over
it
so
at
last
to
quiet
my
conscience
i
framed
this
message
to
the
knights
to
the
honorable
the
commander
of
the
insurgent
chivalry
of
england
you
fight
in
vain
we
know
your
strengthif
one
may
call
it
by
that
name
we
know
that
at
the
utmost
you
cannot
bring
against
us
above
five
and
twenty
thousand
knights
therefore
you
have
no
chancenone
whatever
reflect
we
are
well
equipped
well
fortified
we
number
54
fiftyfour
what
men
no
mindsthe
capablest
in
the
world
a
force
against
which
mere
animal
might
may
no
more
hope
to
prevail
than
may
the
idle
waves
of
the
sea
hope
to
prevail
against
the
granite
barriers
of
england
be
advised
we
offer
you
your
lives
for
the
sake
of
your
families
do
not
reject
the
gift
we
offer
you
this
chance
and
it
is
the
last
throw
down
your
arms
surrender
unconditionally
to
the
republic
and
all
will
be
forgiven
signed
the
boss
i
read
it
to
clarence
and
said
i
proposed
to
send
it
by
a
flag
of
truce
he
laughed
the
sarcastic
laugh
he
was
born
with
and
said
somehow
it
seems
impossible
for
you
to
ever
fully
realize
what
these
nobilities
are
now
let
us
save
a
little
time
and
trouble
consider
me
the
commander
of
the
knights
yonder
now
then
you
are
the
flag
of
truce
approach
and
deliver
me
your
message
and
i
will
give
you
your
answer
i
humored
the
idea
i
came
forward
under
an
imaginary
guard
of
the
enemys
soldiers
produced
my
paper
and
read
it
through
for
answer
clarence
struck
the
paper
out
of
my
hand
pursed
up
a
scornful
lip
and
said
with
lofty
disdain
dismember
me
this
animal
and
return
him
in
a
basket
to
the
baseborn
knave
who
sent
him
other
answer
have
i
none
how
empty
is
theory
in
presence
of
fact
and
this
was
just
fact
and
nothing
else
it
was
the
thing
that
would
have
happened
there
was
no
getting
around
that
i
tore
up
the
paper
and
granted
my
mistimed
sentimentalities
a
permanent
rest
then
to
business
i
tested
the
electric
signals
from
the
gatling
platform
to
the
cave
and
made
sure
that
they
were
all
right
i
tested
and
retested
those
which
commanded
the
fencesthese
were
signals
whereby
i
could
break
and
renew
the
electric
current
in
each
fence
independently
of
the
others
at
will
i
placed
the
brookconnection
under
the
guard
and
authority
of
three
of
my
best
boys
who
would
alternate
in
twohour
watches
all
night
and
promptly
obey
my
signal
if
i
should
have
occasion
to
give
it
three
revolvershots
in
quick
succession
sentryduty
was
discarded
for
the
night
and
the
corral
left
empty
of
life
i
ordered
that
quiet
be
maintained
in
the
cave
and
the
electric
lights
turned
down
to
a
glimmer
as
soon
as
it
was
good
and
dark
i
shut
off
the
current
from
all
the
fences
and
then
groped
my
way
out
to
the
embankment
bordering
our
side
of
the
great
dynamite
ditch
i
crept
to
the
top
of
it
and
lay
there
on
the
slant
of
the
muck
to
watch
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
as
for
sounds
there
were
none
the
stillness
was
deathlike
true
there
were
the
usual
nightsounds
of
the
countrythe
whir
of
nightbirds
the
buzzing
of
insects
the
barking
of
distant
dogs
the
mellow
lowing
of
faroff
kine
but
these
didnt
seem
to
break
the
stillness
they
only
intensified
it
and
added
a
grewsome
melancholy
to
it
into
the
bargain
i
presently
gave
up
looking
the
night
shut
down
so
black
but
i
kept
my
ears
strained
to
catch
the
least
suspicious
sound
for
i
judged
i
had
only
to
wait
and
i
shouldnt
be
disappointed
however
i
had
to
wait
a
long
time
at
last
i
caught
what
you
may
call
in
distinct
glimpses
of
sound
dulled
metallic
sound
i
pricked
up
my
ears
then
and
held
my
breath
for
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
i
had
been
waiting
for
this
sound
thickened
and
approachedfrom
toward
the
north
presently
i
heard
it
at
my
own
levelthe
ridgetop
of
the
opposite
embankment
a
hundred
feet
or
more
away
then
i
seemed
to
see
a
row
of
black
dots
appear
along
that
ridgehuman
heads
i
couldnt
tell
it
mightnt
be
anything
at
all
you
cant
depend
on
your
eyes
when
your
imagination
is
out
of
focus
however
the
question
was
soon
settled
i
heard
that
metallic
noise
descending
into
the
great
ditch
it
augmented
fast
it
spread
all
along
and
it
unmistakably
furnished
me
this
fact
an
armed
host
was
taking
up
its
quarters
in
the
ditch
yes
these
people
were
arranging
a
little
surprise
party
for
us
we
could
expect
entertainment
about
dawn
possibly
earlier
i
groped
my
way
back
to
the
corral
now
i
had
seen
enough
i
went
to
the
platform
and
signaled
to
turn
the
current
on
to
the
two
inner
fences
then
i
went
into
the
cave
and
found
everything
satisfactory
therenobody
awake
but
the
workingwatch
i
woke
clarence
and
told
him
the
great
ditch
was
filling
up
with
men
and
that
i
believed
all
the
knights
were
coming
for
us
in
a
body
it
was
my
notion
that
as
soon
as
dawn
approached
we
could
expect
the
ditchs
ambuscaded
thousands
to
swarm
up
over
the
embankment
and
make
an
assault
and
be
followed
immediately
by
the
rest
of
their
army
clarence
said
they
will
be
wanting
to
send
a
scout
or
two
in
the
dark
to
make
preliminary
observations
why
not
take
the
lightning
off
the
outer
fences
and
give
them
a
chance
ive
already
done
it
clarence
did
you
ever
know
me
to
be
inhospitable
no
you
are
a
good
heart
i
want
to
go
and
be
a
reception
committee
i
will
go
too
we
crossed
the
corral
and
lay
down
together
between
the
two
inside
fences
even
the
dim
light
of
the
cave
had
disordered
our
eyesight
somewhat
but
the
focus
straightway
began
to
regulate
itself
and
soon
it
was
adjusted
for
present
circumstances
we
had
had
to
feel
our
way
before
but
we
could
make
out
to
see
the
fence
posts
now
we
started
a
whispered
conversation
but
suddenly
clarence
broke
off
and
said
what
is
that
what
is
what
that
thing
yonder
what
thingwhere
there
beyond
you
a
little
piecedark
somethinga
dull
shape
of
some
kindagainst
the
second
fence
i
gazed
and
he
gazed
i
said
could
it
be
a
man
clarence
no
i
think
not
if
you
notice
it
looks
a
litwhy
it
is
a
manleaning
on
the
fence
i
certainly
believe
it
is
let
us
go
and
see
we
crept
along
on
our
hands
and
knees
until
we
were
pretty
close
and
then
looked
up
yes
it
was
a
mana
dim
great
figure
in
armor
standing
erect
with
both
hands
on
the
upper
wireand
of
course
there
was
a
smell
of
burning
flesh
poor
fellow
dead
as
a
doornail
and
never
knew
what
hurt
him
he
stood
there
like
a
statueno
motion
about
him
except
that
his
plumes
swished
about
a
little
in
the
night
wind
we
rose
up
and
looked
in
through
the
bars
of
his
visor
but
couldnt
make
out
whether
we
knew
him
or
notfeatures
too
dim
and
shadowed
we
heard
muffled
sounds
approaching
and
we
sank
down
to
the
ground
where
we
were
we
made
out
another
knight
vaguely
he
was
coming
very
stealthily
and
feeling
his
way
he
was
near
enough
now
for
us
to
see
him
put
out
a
hand
find
an
upper
wire
then
bend
and
step
under
it
and
over
the
lower
one
now
he
arrived
at
the
first
knightand
started
slightly
when
he
discovered
him
he
stood
a
momentno
doubt
wondering
why
the
other
one
didnt
move
on
then
he
said
in
a
low
voice
why
dreamest
thou
here
good
sir
mar
then
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
corpses
shoulderand
just
uttered
a
little
soft
moan
and
sunk
down
dead
killed
by
a
dead
man
you
seekilled
by
a
dead
friend
in
fact
there
was
something
awful
about
it
these
early
birds
came
scattering
along
after
each
other
about
one
every
five
minutes
in
our
vicinity
during
half
an
hour
they
brought
no
armor
of
offense
but
their
swords
as
a
rule
they
carried
the
sword
ready
in
the
hand
and
put
it
forward
and
found
the
wires
with
it
we
would
now
and
then
see
a
blue
spark
when
the
knight
that
caused
it
was
so
far
away
as
to
be
invisible
to
us
but
we
knew
what
had
happened
all
the
same
poor
fellow
he
had
touched
a
charged
wire
with
his
sword
and
been
electrocuted
we
had
brief
intervals
of
grim
stillness
interrupted
with
piteous
regularity
by
the
clash
made
by
the
falling
of
an
ironclad
and
this
sort
of
thing
was
going
on
right
along
and
was
very
creepy
there
in
the
dark
and
lonesomeness
we
concluded
to
make
a
tour
between
the
inner
fences
we
elected
to
walk
upright
for
conveniences
sake
we
argued
that
if
discerned
we
should
be
taken
for
friends
rather
than
enemies
and
in
any
case
we
should
be
out
of
reach
of
swords
and
these
gentry
did
not
seem
to
have
any
spears
along
well
it
was
a
curious
trip
everywhere
dead
men
were
lying
outside
the
second
fencenot
plainly
visible
but
still
visible
and
we
counted
fifteen
of
those
pathetic
statuesdead
knights
standing
with
their
hands
on
the
upper
wire
one
thing
seemed
to
be
sufficiently
demonstrated
our
current
was
so
tremendous
that
it
killed
before
the
victim
could
cry
out
pretty
soon
we
detected
a
muffled
and
heavy
sound
and
next
moment
we
guessed
what
it
was
it
was
a
surprise
in
force
coming
i
whispered
clarence
to
go
and
wake
the
army
and
notify
it
to
wait
in
silence
in
the
cave
for
further
orders
he
was
soon
back
and
we
stood
by
the
inner
fence
and
watched
the
silent
lightning
do
its
awful
work
upon
that
swarming
host
one
could
make
out
but
little
of
detail
but
he
could
note
that
a
black
mass
was
piling
itself
up
beyond
the
second
fence
that
swelling
bulk
was
dead
men
our
camp
was
enclosed
with
a
solid
wall
of
the
deada
bulwark
a
breastwork
of
corpses
you
may
say
one
terrible
thing
about
this
thing
was
the
absence
of
human
voices
there
were
no
cheers
no
war
cries
being
intent
upon
a
surprise
these
men
moved
as
noiselessly
as
they
could
and
always
when
the
front
rank
was
near
enough
to
their
goal
to
make
it
proper
for
them
to
begin
to
get
a
shout
ready
of
course
they
struck
the
fatal
line
and
went
down
without
testifying
i
sent
a
current
through
the
third
fence
now
and
almost
immediately
through
the
fourth
and
fifth
so
quickly
were
the
gaps
filled
up
i
believed
the
time
was
come
now
for
my
climax
i
believed
that
that
whole
army
was
in
our
trap
anyway
it
was
high
time
to
find
out
so
i
touched
a
button
and
set
fifty
electric
suns
aflame
on
the
top
of
our
precipice
land
what
a
sight
we
were
enclosed
in
three
walls
of
dead
men
all
the
other
fences
were
pretty
nearly
filled
with
the
living
who
were
stealthily
working
their
way
forward
through
the
wires
the
sudden
glare
paralyzed
this
host
petrified
them
you
may
say
with
astonishment
there
was
just
one
instant
for
me
to
utilize
their
immobility
in
and
i
didnt
lose
the
chance
you
see
in
another
instant
they
would
have
recovered
their
faculties
then
theyd
have
burst
into
a
cheer
and
made
a
rush
and
my
wires
would
have
gone
down
before
it
but
that
lost
instant
lost
them
their
opportunity
forever
while
even
that
slight
fragment
of
time
was
still
unspent
i
shot
the
current
through
all
the
fences
and
struck
the
whole
host
dead
in
their
tracks
there
was
a
groan
you
could
hear
it
voiced
the
deathpang
of
eleven
thousand
men
it
swelled
out
on
the
night
with
awful
pathos
a
glance
showed
that
the
rest
of
the
enemyperhaps
ten
thousand
strongwere
between
us
and
the
encircling
ditch
and
pressing
forward
to
the
assault
consequently
we
had
them
all
and
had
them
past
help
time
for
the
last
act
of
the
tragedy
i
fired
the
three
appointed
revolver
shotswhich
meant
turn
on
the
water
there
was
a
sudden
rush
and
roar
and
in
a
minute
the
mountain
brook
was
raging
through
the
big
ditch
and
creating
a
river
a
hundred
feet
wide
and
twentyfive
deep
stand
to
your
guns
men
open
fire
the
thirteen
gatlings
began
to
vomit
death
into
the
fated
ten
thousand
they
halted
they
stood
their
ground
a
moment
against
that
withering
deluge
of
fire
then
they
broke
faced
about
and
swept
toward
the
ditch
like
chaff
before
a
gale
a
full
fourth
part
of
their
force
never
reached
the
top
of
the
lofty
embankment
the
threefourths
reached
it
and
plunged
overto
death
by
drowning
within
ten
short
minutes
after
we
had
opened
fire
armed
resistance
was
totally
annihilated
the
campaign
was
ended
we
fiftyfour
were
masters
of
england
twentyfive
thousand
men
lay
dead
around
us
but
how
treacherous
is
fortune
in
a
little
whilesay
an
hour
happened
a
thing
by
my
own
fault
whichbut
i
have
no
heart
to
write
that
let
the
record
end
here
chapter
xliv
a
postscript
by
clarence
i
clarence
must
write
it
for
him
he
proposed
that
we
two
go
out
and
see
if
any
help
could
be
accorded
the
wounded
i
was
strenuous
against
the
project
i
said
that
if
there
were
many
we
could
do
but
little
for
them
and
it
would
not
be
wise
for
us
to
trust
ourselves
among
them
anyway
but
he
could
seldom
be
turned
from
a
purpose
once
formed
so
we
shut
off
the
electric
current
from
the
fences
took
an
escort
along
climbed
over
the
enclosing
ramparts
of
dead
knights
and
moved
out
upon
the
field
the
first
wounded
mall
who
appealed
for
help
was
sitting
with
his
back
against
a
dead
comrade
when
the
boss
bent
over
him
and
spoke
to
him
the
man
recognized
him
and
stabbed
him
that
knight
was
sir
meliagraunce
as
i
found
out
by
tearing
off
his
helmet
he
will
not
ask
for
help
any
more
we
carried
the
boss
to
the
cave
and
gave
his
wound
which
was
not
very
serious
the
best
care
we
could
in
this
service
we
had
the
help
of
merlin
though
we
did
not
know
it
he
was
disguised
as
a
woman
and
appeared
to
be
a
simple
old
peasant
goodwife
in
this
disguise
with
brownstained
face
and
smooth
shaven
he
had
appeared
a
few
days
after
the
boss
was
hurt
and
offered
to
cook
for
us
saying
her
people
had
gone
off
to
join
certain
new
camps
which
the
enemy
were
forming
and
that
she
was
starving
the
boss
had
been
getting
along
very
well
and
had
amused
himself
with
finishing
up
his
record
we
were
glad
to
have
this
woman
for
we
were
short
handed
we
were
in
a
trap
you
seea
trap
of
our
own
making
if
we
stayed
where
we
were
our
dead
would
kill
us
if
we
moved
out
of
our
defenses
we
should
no
longer
be
invincible
we
had
conquered
in
turn
we
were
conquered
the
boss
recognized
this
we
all
recognized
it
if
we
could
go
to
one
of
those
new
camps
and
patch
up
some
kind
of
terms
with
the
enemyyes
but
the
boss
could
not
go
and
neither
could
i
for
i
was
among
the
first
that
were
made
sick
by
the
poisonous
air
bred
by
those
dead
thousands
others
were
taken
down
and
still
others
tomorrow
tomorrow
it
is
here
and
with
it
the
end
about
midnight
i
awoke
and
saw
that
hag
making
curious
passes
in
the
air
about
the
bosss
head
and
face
and
wondered
what
it
meant
everybody
but
the
dynamowatch
lay
steeped
in
sleep
there
was
no
sound
the
woman
ceased
from
her
mysterious
foolery
and
started
tiptoeing
toward
the
door
i
called
out
stop
what
have
you
been
doing
she
halted
and
said
with
an
accent
of
malicious
satisfaction
ye
were
conquerors
ye
are
conquered
these
others
are
perishing
you
also
ye
shall
all
die
in
this
placeevery
oneexcept
him
he
sleepeth
nowand
shall
sleep
thirteen
centuries
i
am
merlin
then
such
a
delirium
of
silly
laughter
overtook
him
that
he
reeled
about
like
a
drunken
man
and
presently
fetched
up
against
one

the

the

ps
by
mt
the
dawn
was
come
when
i
laid
the
manuscript
aside
the
rain
had
almost
ceased
the
world
was
gray
and
sad
the
exhausted
storm
was
sighing
and
sobbing
itself
to
rest
i
went
to
the
strangers
room
and
listened
at
his
door
which
was
slightly
ajar
i
could
hear
his
voice
and
so
i
knocked
there
was
no
answer
but
i
still
heard
the
voice
i
peeped
in
the
man
lay
on
his
back
in
bed
talking
brokenly
but
with
spirit
and
punctuating
with
his
arms
which
he
thrashed
about
restlessly
as
sick
people
do
in
delirium
i
slipped
in
softly
and
bent
over
him
his
mutterings
and
ejaculations
went
on
i
spokemerely
a
word
to
call
his
attention
his
glassy
eyes
and
his
ashy
face
were
alight
in
an
instant
with
pleasure
gratitude
gladness
welcome

yes
you

i
lost
myself
a
moment

i
thought
you
were
gone
have
i
been
sick
long
it
must
be
so
it
seems
months
to
me
and
such
dreams
such
strange
and
awful
dreams
sandy
dreams
that
were
as
real
as
realitydelirium
of
course
but
so
real
why
i
thought
the
king
was
dead
i
thought
you
were
in
gaul
and
couldnt
get
home
i
thought
there
was
a
revolution
in
the
fantastic
frenzy
of
these
dreams
i
thought
that
clarence
and
i
and
a
handful
of
my
cadets
fought
and
exterminated
the
whole
chivalry
of
england
but
even
that
was
not
the
strangest
i
seemed
to
be
a
creature
out
of
a
remote
unborn
age
centuries
hence
and
even
that
was
as
real
as
the
rest
yes
i
seemed
to
have
flown
back
out
of
that
age
into
this
of
ours
and
then
forward
to
it
again
and
was
set
down
a
stranger
and
forlorn
in
that
strange
england
with
an
abyss
of
thirteen
centuries
yawning
between
me
and
you
between
me
and
my
home
and
my
friends
between
me
and
all
that
is
dear
to
me
all
that
could
make
life
worth
the
living
it
was
awful
awfuler

you
can
ever
imagine

ah

by

by

let
me

nothing
let
it

incoherently

for

silent

apparently
sinking
away
toward
death

his

the
loud
and

resounded
through
the
air
above
the
vast
watery
desert
of
the

about
four
oclock
in
the
evening
of
the
23rd

few
can
possibly
have
forgotten
the
terrible
storm
from
the
northeast
in
the
middle
of
the
equinox
of
that
year
the
tempest
raged
without
intermission
from
the
18th
to
the
26th
of
march
its
ravages
were
terrible
in
america
europe
and
asia
covering
a
distance
of
eighteen
hundred
miles
and
extending
obliquely
to
the
equator
from
the
thirtyfifth
north
parallel
to
the
fortieth
south
parallel
towns
were
overthrown
forests
uprooted
coasts
devastated
by
the
mountains
of
water
which
were
precipitated
on

vessels
cast
on
the
shore
which
the
published
accounts
numbered
by
hundreds
whole
districts
leveled
by
waterspouts
which
destroyed
everything
they
passed
over
several
thousand
people
crushed
on
land
or
drowned
at
sea
such
were
the
traces
of
its
fury
left
by
this
devastating
tempest
it
surpassed
in
disasters
those
which
so
frightfully
ravaged
havana
and
guadalupe
one
on
the
25th
of
october
1810
the
other
on
the
26th
of
july
1825
but
while
so
many
catastrophes
were
taking
place
on
land
and
at
sea
a
drama
not
less
exciting
was
being
enacted
in
the
agitated
air
in
fact
a
balloon
as
a
ball
might
be
carried
on
the
summit
of
a
waterspout
had
been
taken
into
the
circling
movement
of
a
column
of
air
and
had
traversed
space
at
the
rate
of
ninety
miles
an
hour
turning
round
and
round
as
if
seized
by
some
aerial
maelstrom
beneath
the
lower
point
of
the
balloon
swung
a
car
containing
five
passengers
scarcely
visible
in
the
midst
of
the
thick
vapor
mingled
with
spray
which
hung
over
the
surface
of
the
ocean
whence
it
may
be
asked
had
come
that
plaything
of
the
tempest
from
what
part
of
the
world
did
it
rise
it
surely
could
not
have
started
during
the
storm
but
the
storm
had
raged
five
days
already
and
the
first
symptoms
were
manifested
on
the
18th
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
the
balloon
came
from
a
great
distance
for
it
could
not
have
traveled
less
than
two
thousand
miles
in
twentyfour
hours
at
any
rate
the
passengers
destitute
of
all
marks
for
their
guidance
could
not
have
possessed
the
means
of
reckoning
the
route
traversed
since
their
departure
it
was
a
remarkable
fact
that
although
in
the
very
midst
of
the
furious
tempest
they
did
not
suffer
from
it
they
were
thrown
about
and
whirled
round
and
round
without
feeling
the
rotation
in
the
slightest
degree
or
being
sensible
that
they
were
removed
from
a
horizontal
position
their
eyes
could
not
pierce
through
the
thick
mist
which
had
gathered
beneath
the
car
dark
vapor
was
all
around
them
such
was
the
density
of
the
atmosphere
that
they
could
not
be
certain
whether
it
was
day
or
night
no
reflection
of
light
no
sound
from
inhabited
land
no
roaring
of
the
ocean
could
have
reached
them
through
the
obscurity
while
suspended
in
those
elevated
zones
their
rapid
descent
alone
had
informed
them
of
the
dangers
which
they
ran
from
the
waves
however
the
balloon
lightened
of
heavy
articles
such
as
ammunition
arms
and
provisions
had
risen
into
the
higher
layers
of
the
atmosphere
to
a
height
of
4500
feet
the
voyagers
after
having
discovered
that
the
sea
extended
beneath
them
and
thinking
the
dangers
above
less
dreadful
than
those
below
did
not
hesitate
to
throw
overboard
even
their
most
useful
articles
while
they
endeavored
to
lose
no
more
of
that
fluid
the
life
of
their
enterprise
which
sustained
them
above
the
abyss
the
night
passed
in
the
midst
of
alarms
which
would
have
been
death
to
less
energetic
souls
again
the
day
appeared
and
with
it
the
tempest
began
to
moderate
from
the
beginning
of
that
day
the
24th
of
march
it
showed
symptoms
of
abating
at
dawn
some
of
the
lighter
clouds
had
risen
into
the
more
lofty
regions
of
the
air
in
a
few
hours
the
wind
had
changed
from
a
hurricane
to
a
fresh
breeze
that
is
to
say
the
rate
of
the
transit
of
the
atmospheric
layers
was
diminished
by
half
it
was
still
what
sailors
call
a
closereefed
topsail
breeze
but
the
commotion
in
the
elements
had
none
the
less
considerably
diminished
towards
eleven
oclock
the
lower
region
of
the
air
was
sensibly
clearer
the
atmosphere
threw
off
that
chilly
dampness
which
is
felt
after
the
passage
of
a
great
meteor
the
storm
did
not
seem
to
have
gone
farther
to
the
west
it
appeared
to
have
exhausted
itself
could
it
have
passed
away
in
electric
sheets
as
is
sometimes
the
case
with
regard
to
the
typhoons
of
the
indian
ocean
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
also
evident
that
the
balloon
was
again
slowly
descending
with
a
regular
movement
it
appeared
as
if
it
were
little
by
little
collapsing
and
that
its
case
was
lengthening
and
extending
passing
from
a
spherical
to
an
oval
form
towards
midday
the
balloon
was
hovering
above
the
sea
at
a
height
of
only
2000
feet
it
contained
50000
cubic
feet
of
gas
and
thanks
to
its
capacity
it
could
maintain
itself
a
long
time
in
the
air
although
it
should
reach
a
great
altitude
or
might
be
thrown
into
a
horizontal
position
perceiving
their
danger
the
passengers
cast
away
the
last
articles
which
still
weighed
down
the
car
the
few
provisions
they
had
kept
everything
even
to
their
pocketknives
and
one
of
them
having
hoisted
himself
on
to
the
circles
which
united
the
cords
of
the
net
tried
to
secure
more
firmly
the
lower
point
of
the
balloon
it
was
however
evident
to
the
voyagers
that
the
gas
was
failing
and
that
the
balloon
could
no
longer
be
sustained
in
the
higher
regions
they
must
infallibly
perish
there
was
not
a
continent
nor
even
an
island
visible
beneath
them
the
watery
expanse
did
not
present
a
single
speck
of
land
not
a
solid
surface
upon
which
their
anchor
could
hold
it
was
the
open
sea
whose
waves
were
still
dashing
with
tremendous
violence
it
was
the
ocean
without
any
visible
limits
even
for
those
whose
gaze
from
their
commanding
position
extended
over
a
radius
of
forty
miles
the
vast
liquid
plain
lashed
without
mercy
by
the
storm
appeared
as
if
covered
with
herds
of
furious
chargers
whose
white
and
disheveled
crests
were
streaming
in
the
wind
no
land
was
in
sight
not
a
solitary
ship
could
be
seen
it
was
necessary
at
any
cost
to
arrest
their
downward
course
and
to
prevent
the
balloon
from
being
engulfed
in
the
waves
the
voyagers
directed
all
their
energies
to
this
urgent
work
but
notwithstanding
their
efforts
the
balloon
still
fell
and
at
the
same
time
shifted
with
the
greatest
rapidity
following
the
direction
of
the
wind
that
is
to
say
from
the
northeast
to
the
southwest
frightful
indeed
was
the
situation
of
these
unfortunate
men
they
were
evidently
no
longer
masters
of
the
machine
all
their
attempts
were
useless
the
case
of
the
balloon
collapsed
more
and
more
the
gas
escaped
without
any
possibility
of
retaining
it
their
descent
was
visibly
accelerated
and
soon
after
midday
the
car
hung
within
600
feet
of
the
ocean
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
the
escape
of
gas
which
rushed
through
a
large
rent
in
the
silk
by
lightening
the
car
of
all
the
articles
which
it
contained
the
passengers
had
been
able
to
prolong
their
suspension
in
the
air
for
a
few
hours
but
the
inevitable
catastrophe
could
only
be
retarded
and
if
land
did
not
appear
before
night
voyagers
car
and
balloon
must
to
a
certainty
vanish
beneath
the
waves
they
now
resorted
to
the
only
remaining
expedient
they
were
truly
dauntless
men
who
knew
how
to
look
death
in
the
face
not
a
single
murmur
escaped
from
their
lips
they
were
determined
to
struggle
to
the
last
minute
to
do
anything
to
retard
their
fall
the
car
was
only
a
sort
of
willow
basket
unable
to
float
and
there
was
not
the
slightest
possibility
of
maintaining
it
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
two
more
hours
passed
and
the
balloon
was
scarcely
400
feet
above
the
water
at
that
moment
a
loud
voice
the
voice
of
a
man
whose
heart
was
inaccessible
to
fear
was
heard
to
this
voice
responded
others
not
less
determined
is
everything
thrown
out
no
here
are
still
2000
dollars
in
gold
a
heavy
bag
immediately
plunged
into
the
sea
does
the
balloon
rise
a
little
but
it
will
not
be
long
before
it
falls
again
what
still
remains
to
be
thrown
out
nothing
yes
the
car
let
us
catch
hold
of
the
net
and
into
the
sea
with
the
car
this
was
in
fact
the
last
and
only
mode
of
lightening
the
balloon
the
ropes
which
held
the
car
were
cut
and
the
balloon
after
its
fall
mounted
2000
feet
the
five
voyagers
had
hoisted
themselves
into
the
net
and
clung
to
the
meshes
gazing
at
the
abyss
the
delicate
sensibility
of
balloons
is
well
known
it
is
sufficient
to
throw
out
the
lightest
article
to
produce
a
difference
in
its
vertical
position
the
apparatus
in
the
air
is
like
a
balance
of
mathematical
precision
it
can
be
thus
easily
understood
that
when
it
is
lightened
of
any
considerable
weight
its
movement
will
be
impetuous
and
sudden
so
it
happened
on
this
occasion
but
after
being
suspended
for
an
instant
aloft
the
balloon
began
to
redescend
the
gas
escaping
by
the
rent
which
it
was
impossible
to
repair
the
men
had
done
all
that
men
could
do
no
human
efforts
could
save
them
now
they
must
trust
to
the
mercy
of
him
who
rules
the
elements
at
four
oclock
the
balloon
was
only
500
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
water
a
loud
barking
was
heard
a
dog
accompanied
the
voyagers
and
was
held
pressed
close
to
his
master
in
the
meshes
of
the
net
top
has
seen
something
cried
one
of
the
men
then
immediately
a
loud
voice
shouted
land
land
the
balloon
which
the
wind
still
drove
towards
the
southwest
had
since
daybreak
gone
a
considerable
distance
which
might
be
reckoned
by
hundreds
of
miles
and
a
tolerably
high
land
had
in
fact
appeared
in
that
direction
but
this
land
was
still
thirty
miles
off
it
would
not
take
less
than
an
hour
to
get
to
it
and
then
there
was
the
chance
of
falling
to
leeward
an
hour
might
not
the
balloon
before
that
be
emptied
of
all
the
fluid
it
yet
retained
such
was
the
terrible
question
the
voyagers
could
distinctly
see
that
solid
spot
which
they
must
reach
at
any
cost
they
were
ignorant
of
what
it
was
whether
an
island
or
a
continent
for
they
did
not
know
to
what
part
of
the
world
the
hurricane
had
driven
them
but
they
must
reach
this
land
whether
inhabited
or
desolate
whether
hospitable
or
not
it
was
evident
that
the
balloon
could
no
longer
support
itself
several
times
already
had
the
crests
of
the
enormous
billows
licked
the
bottom
of
the
net
making
it
still
heavier
and
the
balloon
only
half
rose
like
a
bird
with
a
wounded
wing
half
an
hour
later
the
land
was
not
more
than
a
mile
off
but
the
balloon
exhausted
flabby
hanging
in
great
folds
had
gas
in
its
upper
part
alone
the
voyagers
clinging
to
the
net
were
still
too
heavy
for
it
and
soon
half
plunged
into
the
sea
they
were
beaten
by
the
furious
waves
the
ballooncase
bulged
out
again
and
the
wind
taking
it
drove
it
along
like
a
vessel
might
it
not
possibly
thus
reach
the
land
but
when
only
two
fathoms
off
terrible
cries
resounded
from
four
pairs
of
lungs
at
once
the
balloon
which
had
appeared
as
if
it
would
never
again
rise
suddenly
made
an
unexpected
bound
after
having
been
struck
by
a
tremendous
sea
as
if
it
had
been
at
that
instant
relieved
of
a
new
part
of
its
weight
it
mounted
to
a
height
of
1500
feet
and
here
it
met
a
current
of
wind
which
instead
of
taking
it
directly
to
the
coast
carried
it
in
a
nearly
parallel
direction
at
last
two
minutes
later
it
reproached
obliquely
and
finally
fell
on
a
sandy
beach
out
of
the
reach
of
the
waves
the
voyagers
aiding
each
other
managed
to
disengage
themselves
from
the
meshes
of
the
net
the
balloon
relieved
of
their
weight
was
taken
by
the
wind
and
like
a
wounded
bird
which
revives
for
an
instant
disappeared
into
space
but
the
car
had
contained
five
passengers
with
a
dog
and
the
balloon
only
left
four
on
the
shore
the
missing
person
had
evidently
been
swept
off
by
the
sea
which
had
just
struck
the
net
and
it
was
owing
to
this
circumstance
that
the
lightened
balloon
rose
the
last
time
and
then
soon
after
reached
the
land
scarcely
had
the
four
castaways
set
foot
on
firm
ground
than
they
all
thinking
of
the
absent
one
simultaneously
exclaimed
perhaps
he
will
try
to
swim
to
land
let
us
save
him
let
us
save
him

those
whom
the
hurricane
had
just
thrown
on
this
coast
were
neither
aeronauts
by
profession
nor
amateurs
they
were
prisoners
of
war
whose
boldness
had
induced
them
to
escape
in
this
extraordinary
manner
a
hundred
times
they
had
almost
perished
a
hundred
times
had
they
almost
fallen
from
their
torn
balloon
into
the
depths
of
the
ocean
but
heaven
had
reserved
them
for
a
strange
destiny
and
after
having
on
the
20th
of
march
escaped
from
richmond
besieged
by
the
troops
of

they
found
themselves
seven
thousand
miles
from
the
capital

the
principal
stronghold
of
the
south
during
the
terrible
war
of

their
aerial
voyage
had
lasted
five
days
the
curious
circumstances
which
led
to
the
escape
of
the
prisoners
were
as
follows
that
same
year
in
the
month
of
february
1865
in
one
of
the
coups
de

attempted
though
in
vain
to
possess
himself
of

several

fell
into
the

was
one
of
those
engineers
who
began
by
handling
the
hammer
and

like
generals

besides

was

fulfilled

cyrus
harding
was
courage
personified
he
had
been
in
all
the

hundreds

captain
harding
had
almost
been
among
those
who
were
not
counted
by
the
terrible
grant
but
in
these
combats
where
he
never
spared
himself
fortune
favored
him
till
the
moment
when
he
was
wounded

taken
prisoner
on

field
of
battle
near

at
the

on
the

day
another
important
personage
fell
into

this
was
no
other
than
gideon

gideon

was
one
of
that
race
of
indomitable
english

american
chroniclers
like

nothing

transmit
it

the

each

light
on

it

he

and
gideon
spilett
who
did
not
know
each
other
except
by
reputation
had
both
been
carried
to
richmond
the
engineers
wounds
rapidly
healed
and
it
was
during
his
convalescence
that
he
made
acquaintance
with
the
reporter
the
two
men
then
learned
to
appreciate
each
other
soon
their
common
aim
had
but
one
object
that
of
escaping
rejoining
grants
army
and
fighting
together
in
the
ranks
of
the
federals
the
two
americans
had
from
the
first
determined
to
seize
every
chance
but
although
they
were
allowed
to
wander
at
liberty
in
the
town
richmond
was
so
strictly
guarded
that
escape
appeared
impossible
in
the
meanwhile
captain
harding
was
rejoined
by
a
servant
who
was
devoted
to
him
in
life
and
in
death
this
intrepid
fellow
was
a
negro
born
on
the
engineers
estate
of
a
slave
father
and
mother
but
to
whom
cyrus
who
was
an
abolitionist
from
conviction
and
heart
had
long
since
given
his
freedom
the
once
slave
though
free
would
not
leave
his
master
he
would
have
died
for
him
he
was
a
man
of
about
thirty
vigorous
active
clever
intelligent
gentle
and
calm
sometimes
naive
always
merry
obliging
and
honest
his
name
was
nebuchadnezzar
but
he
only
answered
to
the
familiar
abbreviation
of
neb
when
neb
heard
that
his
master
had
been
made
prisoner
he
left
massachusetts
without
hesitating
an
instant
arrived
before
richmond
and
by
dint
of
stratagem
and
shrewdness
after
having
risked
his
life
twenty
times
over
managed
to
penetrate
into
the
besieged
town
the
pleasure
of
harding
on
seeing
his
servant
and
the
joy
of
neb
at
finding
his
master
can
scarcely
be
described
but
though
neb
had
been
able
to
make
his
way
into
richmond
it
was
quite
another
thing
to
get
out
again
for
the
northern
prisoners
were
very
strictly
watched
some
extraordinary
opportunity
was
needed
to
make
the
attempt
with
any
chance
of
success
and
this
opportunity
not
only
did
not
present
itself
but
was
very
difficult
to
find
meanwhile
grant
continued
his
energetic
operations
the
victory
of
petersburg
had
been
very
dearly
bought
his
forces
united
to
those
of
butler
had
as
yet
been
unsuccessful
before
richmond
and
nothing
gave
the
prisoners
any
hope
of
a
speedy
deliverance
the
reporter
to
whom
his
tedious
captivity
did
not
offer
a
single
incident
worthy
of
note
could
stand
it
no
longer
his
usually
active
mind
was
occupied
with
one
sole
thoughthow
he
might
get
out
of
richmond
at
any
cost
several
times
had
he
even
made
the
attempt
but
was
stopped
by
some
insurmountable
obstacle
however
the
siege
continued
and
if
the
prisoners
were
anxious
to
escape
and
join
grants
army
certain
of
the
besieged
were
no
less
anxious
to
join
the
southern
forces
among
them
was
one
jonathan
forster
a
determined
southerner
the
truth
was
that
if
the
prisoners
of
the
secessionists
could
not
leave
the
town
neither
could
the
secessionists
themselves
while
the
northern
army
invested
it
the
governor
of
richmond
for
a
long
time
had
been
unable
to
communicate
with
general
lee
and
he
very
much
wished
to
make
known
to
him
the
situation
of
the
town
so
as
to
hasten
the
march
of
the
army
to
their
relief
thus
jonathan
forster
accordingly
conceived
the
idea
of
rising
in
a
balloon
so
as
to
pass
over
the
besieging
lines
and
in
that
way
reach
the
secessionist
camp
the
governor
authorized
the
attempt
a
balloon
was
manufactured
and
placed
at
the
disposal
of
forster
who
was
to
be
accompanied
by
five
other
persons
they
were
furnished
with
arms
in
case
they
might
have
to
defend
themselves
when
they
alighted
and
provisions
in
the
event
of
their
aerial
voyage
being
prolonged
the
departure
of
the
balloon
was
fixed
for
the
18th
of
march
it
should
be
effected
during
the
night
with
a
northwest
wind
of
moderate
force
and
the
aeronauts
calculated
that
they
would
reach
general
lees
camp
in
a
few
hours
but
this
northwest
wind
was
not
a
simple
breeze
from
the
18th
it
was
evident
that
it
was
changing
to
a
hurricane
the
tempest
soon
became
such
that
forsters
departure
was
deferred
for
it
was
impossible
to
risk
the
balloon
and
those
whom
it
carried
in
the
midst
of
the
furious
elements
the
balloon
inflated
on
the
great
square
of
richmond
was
ready
to
depart
on
the
first
abatement
of
the
wind
and
as
may
be
supposed
the
impatience
among
the
besieged
to
see
the
storm
moderate
was
very
great
the
18th
the
19th
of
march
passed
without
any
alteration
in
the
weather
there
was
even
great
difficulty
in
keeping
the
balloon
fastened
to
the
ground
as
the
squalls
dashed
it
furiously
about
the
night
of
the
19th
passed
but
the
next
morning
the
storm
blew
with
redoubled
force
the
departure
of
the
balloon
was
impossible
on
that
day
the
engineer
cyrus
harding
was
accosted
in
one
of
the
streets
of
richmond
by
a
person
whom
he
did
not
in
the
least
know
this
was
a
sailor
named
pencroft
a
man
of
about
thirtyfive
or
forty
years
of
age
strongly
built
very
sunburnt
and
possessed
of
a
pair
of
bright
sparkling
eyes
and
a
remarkably
good
physiognomy
pencroft
was
an
american
from
the
north
who
had
sailed
all
the
ocean
over
and
who
had
gone
through
every
possible
and
almost
impossible
adventure
that
a
being
with
two
feet
and
no
wings
would
encounter
it
is
needless
to
say
that
he
was
a
bold
dashing
fellow
ready
to
dare
anything
and
was
astonished
at
nothing
pencroft
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
had
gone
to
richmond
on
business
with
a
young
boy
of
fifteen
from
new
jersey
son
of
a
former
captain
an
orphan
whom
he
loved
as
if
he
had
been
his
own
child
not
having
been
able
to
leave
the
town
before
the
first
operations
of
the
siege
he
found
himself
shut
up
to
his
great
disgust
but
not
accustomed
to
succumb
to
difficulties
he
resolved
to
escape
by
some
means
or
other
he
knew
the
engineerofficer
by
reputation
he
knew
with
what
impatience
that
determined
man
chafed
under
his
restraint
on
this
day
he
did
not
therefore
hesitate
to
accost
him
saying
without
circumlocution
have
you
had
enough
of
richmond
captain
the
engineer
looked
fixedly
at
the
man
who
spoke
and
who
added
in
a
low
voice
captain
harding
will
you
try
to
escape
when
asked
the
engineer
quickly
and
it
was
evident
that
this
question
was
uttered
without
consideration
for
he
had
not
yet
examined
the
stranger
who
addressed
him
but
after
having
with
a
penetrating
eye
observed
the
open
face
of
the
sailor
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
before
him
an
honest
man
who
are
you
he
asked
briefly
pencroft
made
himself
known
well
replied
harding
and
in
what
way
do
you
propose
to
escape
by
that
lazy
balloon
which
is
left
there
doing
nothing
and
which
looks
to
me
as
if
it
was
waiting
on
purpose
for
us
there
was
no
necessity
for
the
sailor
to
finish
his
sentence
the
engineer
understood
him
at
once
he
seized
pencroft
by
the
arm
and
dragged
him
to
his
house
there
the
sailor
developed
his
project
which
was
indeed
extremely
simple
they
risked
nothing
but
their
lives
in
its
execution
the
hurricane
was
in
all
its
violence
it
is
true
but
so
clever
and
daring
an
engineer
as
cyrus
harding
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
manage
a
balloon
had
he
himself
been
as
well
acquainted
with
the
art
of
sailing
in
the
air
as
he
was
with
the
navigation
of
a
ship
pencroft
would
not
have
hesitated
to
set
out
of
course
taking
his
young
friend
herbert
with
him
for
accustomed
to
brave
the
fiercest
tempests
of
the
ocean
he
was
not
to
be
hindered
on
account
of
the
hurricane
captain
harding
had
listened
to
the
sailor
without
saying
a
word
but
his
eyes
shone
with
satisfaction
here
was
the
longsoughtfor
opportunityhe
was
not
a
man
to
let
it
pass
the
plan
was
feasible
though
it
must
be
confessed
dangerous
in
the
extreme
in
the
night
in
spite
of
their
guards
they
might
approach
the
balloon
slip
into
the
car
and
then
cut
the
cords
which
held
it
there
was
no
doubt
that
they
might
be
killed
but
on
the
other
hand
they
might
succeed
and
without
this
stormwithout
this
storm
the
balloon
would
have
started
already
and
the
lookedfor
opportunity
would
not
have
then
presented
itself
i
am
not
alone
said
harding
at
last
how
many
people
do
you
wish
to
bring
with
you
asked
the
sailor
two
my
friend
spilett
and
my
servant
neb
that
will
be
three
replied
pencroft
and
with
herbert
and
me
five
but
the
balloon
will
hold
six
that
will
be
enough
we
will
go
answered
harding
in
a
firm
voice
this
we
included
spilett
for
the
reporter
as
his
friend
well
knew
was
not
a
man
to
draw
back
and
when
the
project
was
communicated
to
him
he
approved
of
it
unreservedly
what
astonished
him
was
that
so
simple
an
idea
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
as
to
neb
he
followed
his
master
wherever
his
master
wished
to
go
this
evening
then
said
pencroft
we
will
all
meet
out
there
this
evening
at
ten
oclock
replied
captain
harding
and
heaven
grant
that
the
storm
does
not
abate
before
our
departure
pencroft
took
leave
of
the
two
friends
and
returned
to
his
lodging
where
young
herbert
brown
had
remained
the
courageous
boy
knew
of
the
sailors
plan
and
it
was
not
without
anxiety
that
he
awaited
the
result
of
the
proposal
being
made
to
the
engineer
thus
five
determined
persons
were
about
to
abandon
themselves
to
the
mercy
of
the
tempestuous
elements
no
the
storm
did
not
abate
and
neither
jonathan
forster
nor
his
companions
dreamed
of
confronting
it
in
that
frail
car
it
would
be
a
terrible
journey
the
engineer
only
feared
one
thing
it
was
that
the
balloon
held
to
the
ground
and
dashed
about
by
the
wind
would
be
torn
into
shreds
for
several
hours
he
roamed
round
the
nearlydeserted
square
surveying
the
apparatus
pencroft
did
the
same
on
his
side
his
hands
in
his
pockets
yawning
now
and
then
like
a
man
who
did
not
know
how
to
kill
the
time
but
really
dreading
like
his
friend
either
the
escape
or
destruction
of
the
balloon
evening
arrived
the
night
was
dark
in
the
extreme
thick
mists
passed
like
clouds
close
to
the
ground
rain
fell
mingled
with
snow
it
was
very
cold
a
mist
hung
over
richmond
it
seemed
as
if
the
violent
storm
had
produced
a
truce
between
the
besiegers
and
the
besieged
and
that
the
cannon
were
silenced
by
the
louder
detonations
of
the
storm
the
streets
of
the
town
were
deserted
it
had
not
even
appeared
necessary
in
that
horrible
weather
to
place
a
guard
in
the
square
in
the
midst
of
which
plunged
the
balloon
everything
favored
the
departure
of
the
prisoners
but
what
might
possibly
be
the
termination
of
the
hazardous
voyage
they
contemplated
in
the
midst
of
the
furious
elements
dirty
weather
exclaimed
pencroft
fixing
his
hat
firmly
on
his
head
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
but
pshaw
we
shall
succeed
all
the
same
at
halfpast
nine
harding
and
his
companions
glided
from
different
directions
into
the
square
which
the
gaslamps
extinguished
by
the
wind
had
left
in
total
obscurity
even
the
enormous
balloon
almost
beaten
to
the
ground
could
not
be
seen
independently
of
the
sacks
of
ballast
to
which
the
cords
of
the
net
were
fastened
the
car
was
held
by
a
strong
cable
passed
through
a
ring
in
the
pavement
the
five
prisoners
met
by
the
car
they
had
not
been
perceived
and
such
was
the
darkness
that
they
could
not
even
see
each
other
without
speaking
a
word
harding
spilett
neb
and
herbert
took
their
places
in
the
car
while
pencroft
by
the
engineers
order
detached
successively
the
bags
of
ballast
it
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
only
and
the
sailor
rejoined
his
companions
the
balloon
was
then
only
held
by
the
cable
and
the
engineer
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
give
the
word
at
that
moment
a
dog
sprang
with
a
bound
into
the
car
it
was
top
a
favorite
of
the
engineer
the
faithful
creature
having
broken
his
chain
had
followed
his
master
he
however
fearing
that
its
additional
weight
might
impede
their
ascent
wished
to
send
away
the
animal
one
more
will
make
but
little
difference
poor
beast
exclaimed
pencroft
heaving
out
two
bags
of
sand
and
as
he
spoke
letting
go
the
cable
the
balloon
ascending
in
an
oblique
direction
disappeared
after
having
dashed
the
car
against
two
chimneys
which
it
threw
down
as
it
swept
by
them
then
indeed
the
full
rage
of
the
hurricane
was
exhibited
to
the
voyagers
during
the
night
the
engineer
could
not
dream
of
descending
and
when
day
broke
even
a
glimpse
of
the
earth
below
was
intercepted
by
fog
five
days
had
passed
when
a
partial
clearing
allowed
them
to
see
the
wide
extending
ocean
beneath
their
feet
now
lashed
into
the
maddest
fury
by
the
gale
our
readers
will
recollect
what
befell
these
five
daring
individuals
who
set
out
on
their
hazardous
expedition
in
the
balloon
on
the
20th
of
march
five
days
afterwards
four
of
them
were
thrown
on
a
desert
coast
seven
thousand
miles
from
their
country
but
one
of
their
number
was
missing
the
man
who
was
to
be
their
guide
their
leading
spirit
the
engineer
captain
harding
the
instant
they
had
recovered
their
feet
they
all
hurried
to
the
beach
in
the
hopes
of
rendering
him
assistance

the
engineer
the
meshes
of
the
net
having
given
way
had
been
carried
off
by
a
wave
his
dog
also
had
disappeared
the
faithful
animal
had
voluntarily
leaped
out
to
help
his
master
forward
cried
the
reporter
and
all
four
spilett
herbert
pencroft
and
neb
forgetting
their
fatigue
began
their
search
poor
neb
shed
bitter
tears
giving
way
to
despair
at
the
thought
of
having
lost
the
only
being
he
loved
on
earth
only
two
minutes
had
passed
from
the
time
when
cyrus
harding
disappeared
to
the
moment
when
his
companions
set
foot
on
the
ground
they
had
hopes
therefore
of
arriving
in
time
to
save
him
let
us
look
for
him
let
us
look
for
him
cried
neb
yes
neb
replied
gideon
spilett
and
we
will
find
him
too
living
i
trust
still
living
can
he
swim
asked
pencroft
yes
replied
neb
and
besides
top
is
there
the
sailor
observing
the
heavy
surf
on
the
shore
shook
his
head
the
engineer
had
disappeared
to
the
north
of
the
shore
and
nearly
half
a
mile
from
the
place
where
the
castaways
had
landed
the
nearest
point
of
the
beach
he
could
reach
was
thus
fully
that
distance
off
it
was
then
nearly
six
oclock
a
thick
fog
made
the
night
very
dark
the
castaways
proceeded
toward
the
north
of
the
land
on
which
chance
had
thrown
them
an
unknown
region
the
geographical
situation
of
which
they
could
not
even
guess
they
were
walking
upon
a
sandy
soil
mingled
with
stones
which
appeared
destitute
of
any
sort
of
vegetation
the
ground
very
unequal
and
rough
was
in
some
places
perfectly
riddled
with
holes
making
walking
extremely
painful
from
these
holes
escaped
every
minute
great
birds
of
clumsy
flight
which
flew
in
all
directions
others
more
active
rose
in
flocks
and
passed
in
clouds
over
their
heads
the
sailor
thought
he
recognized
gulls
and
cormorants
whose
shrill
cries
rose
above
the
roaring
of
the
sea
from
time
to
time
the
castaways
stopped
and
shouted
then
listened
for
some
response
from
the
ocean
for
they
thought
that
if
the
engineer
had
landed
and
they
had
been
near
to
the
place
they
would
have
heard
the
barking
of
the
dog
top
even
should
harding
himself
have
been
unable
to
give
any
sign
of
existence
they
stopped
to
listen
but
no
sound
arose
above
the
roaring
of
the
waves
and
the
dashing
of
the
surf
the
little
band
then
continued
their
march
forward
searching
into
every
hollow
of
the
shore
after
walking
for
twenty
minutes
the
four
castaways
were
suddenly
brought
to
a
standstill
by
the
sight
of
foaming
billows
close
to
their
feet
the
solid
ground
ended
here
they
found
themselves
at
the
extremity
of
a
sharp
point
on
which
the
sea
broke
furiously
it
is
a
promontory
said
the
sailor
we
must
retrace
our
steps
holding
towards
the
right
and
we
shall
thus
gain
the
mainland
but
if
he
is
there
said
neb
pointing
to
the
ocean
whose
waves
shone
of
a
snowy
white
in
the
darkness
well
let
us
call
again
and
all
uniting
their
voices
they
gave
a
vigorous
shout
but
there
came
no
reply
they
waited
for
a
lull
then
began
again
still
no
reply
the
castaways
accordingly
returned
following
the
opposite
side
of
the
promontory
over
a
soil
equally
sandy
and
rugged
however
pencroft
observed
that
the
shore
was
more
equal
that
the
ground
rose
and
he
declared
that
it
was
joined
by
a
long
slope
to
a
hill
whose
massive
front
he
thought
that
he
could
see
looming
indistinctly
through
the
mist
the
birds
were
less
numerous
on
this
part
of
the
shore
the
sea
was
also
less
tumultuous
and
they
observed
that
the
agitation
of
the
waves
was
diminished
the
noise
of
the
surf
was
scarcely
heard
this
side
of
the
promontory
evidently
formed
a
semicircular
bay
which
the
sharp
point
sheltered
from
the
breakers
of
the
open
sea
but
to
follow
this
direction
was
to
go
south
exactly
opposite
to
that
part
of
the
coast
where
harding
might
have
landed
after
a
walk
of
a
mile
and
a
half
the
shore
presented
no
curve
which
would
permit
them
to
return
to
the
north
this
promontory
of
which
they
had
turned
the
point
must
be
attached
to
the
mainland
the
castaways
although
their
strength
was
nearly
exhausted
still
marched
courageously
forward
hoping
every
moment
to
meet
with
a
sudden
angle
which
would
set
them
in
the
first
direction
what
was
their
disappointment
when
after
trudging
nearly
two
miles
having
reached
an
elevated
point
composed
of
slippery
rocks
they
found
themselves
again
stopped
by
the
sea
we
are
on
an
islet
said
pencroft
and
we
have
surveyed
it
from
one
extremity
to
the
other
the
sailor
was
right
they
had
been
thrown
not
on
a
continent
not
even
on
an
island
but
on
an
islet
which
was
not
more
than
two
miles
in
length
with
even
a
less
breadth
was
this
barren
spot
the
desolate
refuge
of
seabirds
strewn
with
stones
and
destitute
of
vegetation
attached
to
a
more
important
archipelago
it
was
impossible
to
say
when
the
voyagers
from
their
car
saw
the
land
through
the
mist
they
had
not
been
able
to
reconnoiter
it
sufficiently
however
pencroft
accustomed
with
his
sailor
eyes
to
piece
through
the
gloom
was
almost
certain
that
he
could
clearly
distinguish
in
the
west
confused
masses
which
indicated
an
elevated
coast
but
they
could
not
in
the
dark
determine
whether
it
was
a
single
island
or
connected
with
others
they
could
not
leave
it
either
as
the
sea
surrounded
them
they
must
therefore
put
off
till
the
next
day
their
search
for
the
engineer
from
whom
alas
not
a
single
cry
had
reached
them
to
show
that
he
was
still
in
existence
the
silence
of
our
friend
proves
nothing
said
the
reporter
perhaps
he
has
fainted
or
is
wounded
and
unable
to
reply
directly
so
we
will
not
despair
the
reporter
then
proposed
to
light
a
fire
on
a
point
of
the
islet
which
would
serve
as
a
signal
to
the
engineer
but
they
searched
in
vain
for
wood
or
dry
brambles
nothing
but
sand
and
stones
were
to
be
found
the
grief
of
neb
and
his
companions
who
were
all
strongly
attached
to
the
intrepid
harding
can
be
better
pictured
than
described
it
was
too
evident
that
they
were
powerless
to
help
him
they
must
wait
with
what
patience
they
could
for
daylight
either
the
engineer
had
been
able
to
save
himself
and
had
already
found
a
refuge
on
some
point
of
the
coast
or
he
was
lost
for
ever
the
long
and
painful
hours
passed
by
the
cold
was
intense
the
castaways
suffered
cruelly
but
they
scarcely
perceived
it
they
did
not
even
think
of
taking
a
minutes
rest
forgetting
everything
but
their
chief
hoping
or
wishing
to
hope
on
they
continued
to
walk
up
and
down
on
this
sterile
spot
always
returning
to
its
northern
point
where
they
could
approach
nearest
to
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
they
listened
they
called
and
then
uniting
their
voices
they
endeavored
to
raise
even
a
louder
shout
than
before
which
would
be
transmitted
to
a
great
distance
the
wind
had
now
fallen
almost
to
a
calm
and
the
noise
of
the
sea
began
also
to
subside
one
of
nebs
shouts
even
appeared
to
produce
an
echo
herbert
directed
pencrofts
attention
to
it
adding
that
proves
that
there
is
a
coast
to
the
west
at
no
great
distance
the
sailor
nodded
besides
his
eyes
could
not
deceive
him
if
he
had
discovered
land
however
indistinct
it
might
appear
land
was
sure
to
be
there
but
that
distant
echo
was
the
only
response
produced
by
nebs
shouts
while
a
heavy
gloom
hung
over
all
the
part
east
of
the
island
meanwhile
the
sky
was
clearing
little
by
little
towards
midnight
the
stars
shone
out
and
if
the
engineer
had
been
there
with
his
companions
he
would
have
remarked
that
these
stars
did
not
belong
to
the
northern
hemisphere
the
polar
star
was
not
visible
the
constellations
were
not
those
which
they
had
been
accustomed
to
see
in
the
united
states
the
southern
cross
glittered
brightly
in
the
sky
the
night
passed
away
towards
five
oclock
in
the
morning
of
the
25th
of
march
the
sky
began
to
lighten
the
horizon
still
remained
dark
but
with
daybreak
a
thick
mist
rose
from
the
sea
so
that
the
eye
could
scarcely
penetrate
beyond
twenty
feet
or
so
from
where
they
stood
at
length
the
fog
gradually
unrolled
itself
in
great
heavily
moving
waves
it
was
unfortunate
however
that
the
castaways
could
distinguish
nothing
around
them
while
the
gaze
of
the
reporter
and
neb
were
cast
upon
the
ocean
the
sailor
and
herbert
looked
eagerly
for
the
coast
in
the
west
but
not
a
speck
of
land
was
visible
never
mind
said
pencroft
though
i
do
not
see
the
land
i
feel
it
it
is
there
there
as
sure
as
the
fact
that
we
are
no
longer
at
richmond
but
the
fog
was
not
long
in
rising
it
was
only
a
fineweather
mist
a
hot
sun
soon
penetrated
to
the
surface
of
the
island
about
halfpast
six
threequarters
of
an
hour
after
sunrise
the
mist
became
more
transparent
it
grew
thicker
above
but
cleared
away
below
soon
the
isle
appeared
as
if
it
had
descended
from
a
cloud
then
the
sea
showed
itself
around
them
spreading
far
away
towards
the
east
but
bounded
on
the
west
by
an
abrupt
and
precipitous
coast
yes
the
land
was
there
their
safety
was
at
least
provisionally
insured
the
islet
and
the
coast
were
separated
by
a
channel
about
half
a
mile
in
breadth
through
which
rushed
an
extremely
rapid
current
however
one
of
the
castaways
following
the
impulse
of
his
heart
immediately
threw
himself
into
the
current
without
consulting
his
companions
without
saying
a
single
word
it
was
neb
he
was
in
haste
to
be
on
the
other
side
and
to
climb
towards
the
north
it
had
been
impossible
to
hold
him
back
pencroft
called
him
in
vain
the
reporter
prepared
to
follow
him
but
pencroft
stopped
him
do
you
want
to
cross
the
channel
he
asked
yes
replied
spilett
all
right
said
the
seaman
wait
a
bit
neb
is
well
able
to
carry
help
to
his
master
if
we
venture
into
the
channel
we
risk
being
carried
into
the
open
sea
by
the
current
which
is
running
very
strong
but
if
im
not
wrong
it
is
ebbing
see
the
tide
is
going
down
over
the
sand
let
us
have
patience
and
at
low
water
it
is
possible
we
may
find
a
fordable
passage
you
are
right
replied
the
reporter
we
will
not
separate
more
than
we
can
help
during
this
time
neb
was
struggling
vigorously
against
the
current
he
was
crossing
in
an
oblique
direction
his
black
shoulders
could
be
seen
emerging
at
each
stroke
he
was
carried
down
very
quickly
but
he
also
made
way
towards
the
shore
it
took
more
than
half
an
hour
to
cross
from
the
islet
to
the
land
and
he
reached
the
shore
several
hundred
feet
from
the
place
which
was
opposite
to
the
point
from
which
he
had
started
landing
at
the
foot
of
a
high
wall
of
granite
he
shook
himself
vigorously
and
then
setting
off
running
soon
disappeared
behind
a
rocky
point
which
projected
to
nearly
the
height
of
the
northern
extremity
of
the
islet
nebs
companions
had
watched
his
daring
attempt
with
painful
anxiety
and
when
he
was
out
of
sight
they
fixed
their
attention
on
the
land
where
their
hope
of
safety
lay
while
eating
some
shellfish
with
which
the
sand
was
strewn
it
was
a
wretched
repast
but
still
it
was
better
than
nothing
the
opposite
coast
formed
one
vast
bay
terminating
on
the
south
by
a
very
sharp
point
which
was
destitute
of
all
vegetation
and
was
of
a
very
wild
aspect
this
point
abutted
on
the
shore
in
a
grotesque
outline
of
high
granite
rocks
towards
the
north
on
the
contrary
the
bay
widened
and
a
more
rounded
coast
appeared
trending
from
the
southwest
to
the
northeast
and
terminating
in
a
slender
cape
the
distance
between
these
two
extremities
which
made
the
bow
of
the
bay
was
about
eight
miles
half
a
mile
from
the
shore
rose
the
islet
which
somewhat
resembled
the
carcass
of
a
gigantic
whale
its
extreme
breadth
was
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
opposite
the
islet
the
beach
consisted
first
of
sand
covered
with
black
stones
which
were
now
appearing
little
by
little
above
the
retreating
tide
the
second
level
was
separated
by
a
perpendicular
granite
cliff
terminated
at
the
top
by
an
unequal
edge
at
a
height
of
at
least
300
feet
it
continued
thus
for
a
length
of
three
miles
ending
suddenly
on
the
right
with
a
precipice
which
looked
as
if
cut
by
the
hand
of
man
on
the
left
above
the
promontory
this
irregular
and
jagged
cliff
descended
by
a
long
slope
of
conglomerated
rocks
till
it
mingled
with
the
ground
of
the
southern
point
on
the
upper
plateau
of
the
coast
not
a
tree
appeared
it
was
a
flat
tableland
like
that
above
cape
town
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
but
of
reduced
proportions
at
least
so
it
appeared
seen
from
the
islet
however
verdure
was
not
wanting
to
the
right
beyond
the
precipice
they
could
easily
distinguish
a
confused
mass
of
great
trees
which
extended
beyond
the
limits
of
their
view
this
verdure
relieved
the
eye
so
long
wearied
by
the
continued
ranges
of
granite
lastly
beyond
and
above
the
plateau
in
a
northwesterly
direction
and
at
a
distance
of
at
least
seven
miles
glittered
a
white
summit
which
reflected
the
suns
rays
it
was
that
of
a
lofty
mountain
capped
with
snow
the
question
could
not
at
present
be
decided
whether
this
land
formed
an
island
or
whether
it
belonged
to
a
continent
but
on
beholding
the
convulsed
masses
heaped
up
on
the
left
no
geologist
would
have
hesitated
to
give
them
a
volcanic
origin
for
they
were
unquestionably
the
work
of
subterranean
convulsions
gideon
spilett
pencroft
and
herbert
attentively
examined
this
land
on
which
they
might
perhaps
have
to
live
many
long
years
on
which
indeed
they
might
even
die
should
it
be
out
of
the
usual
track
of
vessels
as
was
likely
to
be
the
case
well
asked
herbert
what
do
you
say
pencroft
there
is
some
good
and
some
bad
as
in
everything
replied
the
sailor
we
shall
see
but
now
the
ebb
is
evidently
making
in
three
hours
we
will
attempt
the
passage
and
once
on
the
other
side
we
will
try
to
get
out
of
this
scrape
and
i
hope
may
find
the
captain
pencroft
was
not
wrong
in
his
anticipations
three
hours
later
at
low
tide
the
greater
part
of
the
sand
forming
the
bed
of
the
channel
was
uncovered
between
the
islet
and
the
coast
there
only
remained
a
narrow
channel
which
would
no
doubt
be
easy
to
cross
about
ten
oclock
gideon
spilett
and
his
companions
stripped
themselves
of
their
clothes
which
they
placed
in
bundles
on
their
heads
and
then
ventured
into
the
water
which
was
not
more
than
five
feet
deep
herbert
for
whom
it
was
too
deep
swam
like
a
fish
and
got
through
capitally
all
three
arrived
without
difficulty
on
the
opposite
shore
quickly
drying
themselves
in
the
sun
they
put
on
their
clothes
which
they
had
preserved
from
contact
with
the
water
and
sat
down
to
take
counsel
together
what
to
do
next

all
at
once
the
reporter
sprang
up
and
telling
the
sailor
that
he
would
rejoin
them
at
that
same
place
he
climbed
the
cliff
in
the
direction
which
the
negro
neb
had
taken
a
few
hours
before
anxiety
hastened
his
steps
for
he
longed
to
obtain
news
of
his
friend
and
he
soon
disappeared
round
an
angle
of
the
cliff
herbert
wished
to
accompany
him
stop
here
my
boy
said
the
sailor
we
have
to
prepare
an
encampment
and
to
try
and
find
rather
better
grub
than
these
shellfish
our
friends
will
want
something
when
they
come
back
there
is
work
for
everybody
i
am
ready
replied
herbert
all
right
said
the
sailor
that
will
do
we
must
set
about
it
regularly
we
are
tired
cold
and
hungry
therefore
we
must
have
shelter
fire
and
food
there
is
wood
in
the
forest
and
eggs
in
nests
we
have
only
to
find
a
house
very
well
returned
herbert
i
will
look
for
a
cave
among
the
rocks
and
i
shall
be
sure
to
discover
some
hole
into
which
we
can
creep
all
right
said
pencroft
go
on
my
boy
they
both
walked
to
the
foot
of
the
enormous
wall
over
the
beach
far
from
which
the
tide
had
now
retreated
but
instead
of
going
towards
the
north
they
went
southward
pencroft
had
remarked
several
hundred
feet
from
the
place
at
which
they
landed
a
narrow
cutting
out
of
which
he
thought
a
river
or
stream
might
issue
now
on
the
one
hand
it
was
important
to
settle
themselves
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
good
stream
of
water
and
on
the
other
it
was
possible
that
the
current
had
thrown
cyrus
harding
on
the
shore
there
the
cliff
as
has
been
said
rose
to
a
height
of
three
hundred
feet
but
the
mass
was
unbroken
throughout
and
even
at
its
base
scarcely
washed
by
the
sea
it
did
not
offer
the
smallest
fissure
which
would
serve
as
a
dwelling
it
was
a
perpendicular
wall
of
very
hard
granite
which
even
the
waves
had
not
worn
away
towards
the
summit
fluttered
myriads
of
seafowl
and
especially
those
of
the
webfooted
species
with
long
flat
pointed
beaksa
clamorous
tribe
bold
in
the
presence
of
man
who
probably
for
the
first
time
thus
invaded
their
domains
pencroft
recognized
the
skua
and
other
gulls
among
them
the
voracious
little
seamew
which
in
great
numbers
nestled
in
the
crevices
of
the
granite
a
shot
fired
among
this
swarm
would
have
killed
a
great
number
but
to
fire
a
shot
a
gun
was
needed
and
neither
pencroft
nor
herbert
had
one
besides
this
gulls
and
seamews
are
scarcely
eatable
and
even
their
eggs
have
a
detestable
taste
however
herbert
who
had
gone
forward
a
little
more
to
the
left
soon
came
upon
rocks
covered
with
seaweed
which
some
hours
later
would
be
hidden
by
the
high
tide
on
these
rocks
in
the
midst
of
slippery
wrack
abounded
bivalve
shellfish
not
to
be
despised
by
starving
people
herbert
called
pencroft
who
ran
up
hastily
here
are
mussels
cried
the
sailor
these
will
do
instead
of
eggs
they
are
not
mussels
replied
herbert
who
was
attentively
examining
the
molluscs
attached
to
the
rocks
they
are
lithodomes
are
they
good
to
eat
asked
pencroft
perfectly
so
then
let
us
eat
some
lithodomes
the
sailor
could
rely
upon
herbert
the
young
boy
was
well
up
in
natural
history
and
always
had
had
quite
a
passion
for
the
science
his
father
had
encouraged
him
in
it
by
letting
him
attend
the
lectures
of
the
best
professors
in
boston
who
were
very
fond
of
the
intelligent
industrious
lad
and
his
turn
for
natural
history
was
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
time
of
great
use
and
he
was
not
mistaken
in
this
instance
these
lithodomes
were
oblong
shells
suspended
in
clusters
and
adhering
very
tightly
to
the
rocks
they
belong
to
that
species
of
molluscous
perforators
which
excavate
holes
in
the
hardest
stone
their
shell
is
rounded
at
both
ends
a
feature
which
is
not
remarked
in
the
common
mussel
pencroft
and
herbert
made
a
good
meal
of
the
lithodomes
which
were
then
half
opened
to
the
sun
they
ate
them
as
oysters
and
as
they
had
a
strong
peppery
taste
they
were
palatable
without
condiments
of
any
sort
their
hunger
was
thus
appeased
for
the
time
but
not
their
thirst
which
increased
after
eating
these
naturallyspiced
molluscs
they
had
then
to
find
fresh
water
and
it
was
not
likely
that
it
would
be
wanting
in
such
a
capriciously
uneven
region
pencroft
and
herbert
after
having
taken
the
precaution
of
collecting
an
ample
supply
of
lithodomes
with
which
they
filled
their
pockets
and
handkerchiefs
regained
the
foot
of
the
cliff
two
hundred
paces
farther
they
arrived
at
the
cutting
through
which
as
pencroft
had
guessed
ran
a
stream
of
water
whether
fresh
or
not
was
to
be
ascertained
at
this
place
the
wall
appeared
to
have
been
separated
by
some
violent
subterranean
force
at
its
base
was
hollowed
out
a
little
creek
the
farthest
part
of
which
formed
a
tolerably
sharp
angle
the
watercourse
at
that
part
measured
one
hundred
feet
in
breadth
and
its
two
banks
on
each
side
were
scarcely
twenty
feet
high
the
river
became
strong
almost
directly
between
the
two
walls
of
granite
which
began
to
sink
above
the
mouth
it
then
suddenly
turned
and
disappeared
beneath
a
wood
of
stunted
trees
half
a
mile
off
here
is
the
water
and
yonder
is
the
wood
we
require
said
pencroft
well
herbert
now
we
only
want
the
house
the
water
of
the
river
was
limpid
the
sailor
ascertained
that
at
this
timethat
is
to
say
at
low
tide
when
the
rising
floods
did
not
reach
itit
was
sweet
this
important
point
established
herbert
looked
for
some
cavity
which
would
serve
them
as
a
retreat
but
in
vain
everywhere
the
wall
appeared
smooth
plain
and
perpendicular
however
at
the
mouth
of
the
watercourse
and
above
the
reach
of
the
high
tide
the
convulsions
of
nature
had
formed
not
a
grotto
but
a
pile
of
enormous
rocks
such
as
are
often
met
with
in
granite
countries
and
which
bear
the
name
of
chimneys
pencroft
and
herbert
penetrated
quite
far
in
among
the
rocks
by
sandy
passages
in
which
light
was
not
wanting
for
it
entered
through
the
openings
which
were
left
between
the
blocks
of
which
some
were
only
sustained
by
a
miracle
of
equilibrium
but
with
the
light
came
also
aira
regular
corridorgaleand
with
the
wind
the
sharp
cold
from
the
exterior
however
the
sailor
thought
that
by
stoppingup
some
of
the
openings
with
a
mixture
of
stones
and
sand
the
chimneys
could
be
rendered
habitable
their
geometrical
plan
represented
the
typographical
sign

which
signifies
et
cetera
abridged
but
by
isolating
the
upper
mouth
of
the
sign
through
which
the
south
and
west
winds
blew
so
strongly
they
could
succeed
in
making
the
lower
part
of
use
heres
our
work
said
pencroft
and
if
we
ever
see
captain
harding
again
he
will
know
how
to
make
something
of
this
labyrinth
we
shall
see
him
again
pencroft
cried
herbert
and
when
he
returns
he
must
find
a
tolerable
dwelling
here
it
will
be
so
if
we
can
make
a
fireplace
in
the
left
passage
and
keep
an
opening
for
the
smoke
so
we
can
my
boy
replied
the
sailor
and
these
chimneys
will
serve
our
turn
let
us
set
to
work
but
first
come
and
get
a
store
of
fuel
i
think
some
branches
will
be
very
useful
in
stopping
up
these
openings
through
which
the
wind
shrieks
like
so
many
fiends
herbert
and
pencroft
left
the
chimneys
and
turning
the
angle
they
began
to
climb
the
left
bank
of
the
river
the
current
here
was
quite
rapid
and
drifted
down
some
dead
wood
the
rising
tideand
it
could
already
be
perceivedmust
drive
it
back
with
force
to
a
considerable
distance
the
sailor
then
thought
that
they
could
utilize
this
ebb
and
flow
for
the
transport
of
heavy
objects
after
having
walked
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
sailor
and
the
boy
arrived
at
the
angle
which
the
river
made
in
turning
towards
the
left
from
this
point
its
course
was
pursued
through
a
forest
of
magnificent
trees
these
trees
still
retained
their
verdure
notwithstanding
the
advanced
season
for
they
belonged
to
the
family
of
coniferae
which
is
spread
over
all
the
regions
of
the
globe
from
northern
climates
to
the
tropics
the
young
naturalist
recognized
especially
the
deedara
which
are
very
numerous
in
the
himalayan
zone
and
which
spread
around
them
a
most
agreeable
odor
between
these
beautiful
trees
sprang
up
clusters
of
firs
whose
opaque
open
parasol
boughs
spread
wide
around
among
the
long
grass
pencroft
felt
that
his
feet
were
crushing
dry
branches
which
crackled
like
fireworks
well
my
boy
said
he
to
herbert
if
i
dont
know
the
name
of
these
trees
at
any
rate
i
reckon
that
we
may
call
them
burning
wood
and
just
now
thats
the
chief
thing
we
want
let
us
get
a
supply
replied
herbert
who
immediately
set
to
work
the
collection
was
easily
made
it
was
not
even
necessary
to
lop
the
trees
for
enormous
quantities
of
dead
wood
were
lying
at
their
feet
but
if
fuel
was
not
wanting
the
means
of
transporting
it
was
not
yet
found
the
wood
being
very
dry
would
burn
rapidly
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
carry
to
the
chimneys
a
considerable
quantity
and
the
loads
of
two
men
would
not
be
sufficient
herbert
remarked
this
well
my
boy
replied
the
sailor
there
must
be
some
way
of
carrying
this
wood
there
is
always
a
way
of
doing
everything
if
we
had
a
cart
or
a
boat
it
would
be
easy
enough
but
we
have
the
river
said
herbert
right
replied
pencroft
the
river
will
be
to
us
like
a
road
which
carries
of
itself
and
rafts
have
not
been
invented
for
nothing
only
observed
herbert
at
this
moment
our
road
is
going
the
wrong
way
for
the
tide
is
rising
we
shall
be
all
right
if
we
wait
till
it
ebbs
replied
the
sailor
and
then
we
will
trust
it
to
carry
our
fuel
to
the
chimneys
let
us
get
the
raft
ready
the
sailor
followed
by
herbert
directed
his
steps
towards
the
river
they
both
carried
each
in
proportion
to
his
strength
a
load
of
wood
bound
in
fagots
they
found
on
the
bank
also
a
great
quantity
of
dead
branches
in
the
midst
of
grass
among
which
the
foot
of
man
had
probably
never
before
trod
pencroft
began
directly
to
make
his
raft
in
a
kind
of
little
bay
created
by
a
point
of
the
shore
which
broke
the
current
the
sailor
and
the
lad
placed
some
goodsized
pieces
of
wood
which
they
had
fastened
together
with
dry
creepers
a
raft
was
thus
formed
on
which
they
stacked
all
they
had
collected
sufficient
indeed
to
have
loaded
at
least
twenty
men
in
an
hour
the
work
was
finished
and
the
raft
moored
to
the
bank
awaited
the
turning
of
the
tide
there
were
still
several
hours
to
be
occupied
and
with
one
consent
pencroft
and
herbert
resolved
to
gain
the
upper
plateau
so
as
to
have
a
more
extended
view
of
the
surrounding
country
exactly
two
hundred
feet
behind
the
angle
formed
by
the
river
the
wall
terminated
by
a
fall
of
rocks
died
away
in
a
gentle
slope
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
it
was
a
natural
staircase
herbert
and
the
sailor
began
their
ascent
thanks
to
the
vigor
of
their
muscles
they
reached
the
summit
in
a
few
minutes
and
proceeded
to
the
point
above
the
mouth
of
the
river
on
attaining
it
their
first
look
was
cast
upon
the
ocean
which
not
long
before
they
had
traversed
in
such
a
terrible
condition
they
observed
with
emotion
all
that
part
to
the
north
of
the
coast
on
which
the
catastrophe
had
taken
place
it
was
there
that
cyrus
harding
had
disappeared
they
looked
to
see
if
some
portion
of
their
balloon
to
which
a
man
might
possibly
cling
yet
existed
nothing
the
sea
was
but
one
vast
watery
desert
as
to
the
coast
it
was
solitary
also
neither
the
reporter
nor
neb
could
be
anywhere
seen
but
it
was
possible
that
at
this
time
they
were
both
too
far
away
to
be
perceived
something
tells
me
cried
herbert
that
a
man
as
energetic
as
captain
harding
would
not
let
himself
be
drowned
like
other
people
he
must
have
reached
some
point
of
the
shore
dont
you
think
so
pencroft
the
sailor
shook
his
head
sadly
he
little
expected
ever
to
see
cyrus
harding
again
but
wishing
to
leave
some
hope
to
herbert
doubtless
doubtless
said
he
our
engineer
is
a
man
who
would
get
out
of
a
scrape
to
which
any
one
else
would
yield
in
the
meantime
he
examined
the
coast
with
great
attention
stretched
out
below
them
was
the
sandy
shore
bounded
on
the
right
of
the
rivers
mouth
by
lines
of
breakers
the
rocks
which
were
visible
appeared
like
amphibious
monsters
reposing
in
the
surf
beyond
the
reef
the
sea
sparkled
beneath
the
suns
rays
to
the
south
a
sharp
point
closed
the
horizon
and
it
could
not
be
seen
if
the
land
was
prolonged
in
that
direction
or
if
it
ran
southeast
and
southwest
which
would
have
made
this
coast
a
very
long
peninsula
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
bay
the
outline
of
the
shore
was
continued
to
a
great
distance
in
a
wider
curve
there
the
shore
was
low
flat
without
cliffs
and
with
great
banks
of
sand
which
the
tide
left
uncovered
pencroft
and
herbert
then
returned
towards
the
west
their
attention
was
first
arrested
by
the
snowtopped
mountain
which
rose
at
a
distance
of
six
or
seven
miles
from
its
first
declivities
to
within
two
miles
of
the
coast
were
spread
vast
masses
of
wood
relieved
by
large
green
patches
caused
by
the
presence
of
evergreen
trees
then
from
the
edge
of
this
forest
to
the
shore
extended
a
plain
scattered
irregularly
with
groups
of
trees
here
and
there
on
the
left
sparkled
through
glades
the
waters
of
the
little
river
they
could
trace
its
winding
course
back
towards
the
spurs
of
the
mountain
among
which
it
seemed
to
spring
at
the
point
where
the
sailor
had
left
his
raft
of
wood
it
began
to
run
between
the
two
high
granite
walls
but
if
on
the
left
bank
the
wall
remained
clear
and
abrupt
on
the
right
bank
on
the
contrary
it
sank
gradually
the
massive
sides
changed
to
isolated
rocks
the
rocks
to
stones
the
stones
to
shingle
running
to
the
extremity
of
the
point
are
we
on
an
island
murmured
the
sailor
at
any
rate
it
seems
to
be
big
enough
replied
the
lad
an
island
ever
so
big
is
an
island
all
the
same
said
pencroft
but
this
important
question
could
not
yet
be
answered
a
more
perfect
survey
had
to
be
made
to
settle
the
point
as
to
the
land
itself
island
or
continent
it
appeared
fertile
agreeable
in
its
aspect
and
varied
in
its
productions
this
is
satisfactory
observed
pencroft
and
in
our
misfortune
we
must
thank
providence
for
it
god
be
praised
responded
herbert
whose
pious
heart
was
full
of
gratitude
to
the
author
of
all
things
pencroft
and
herbert
examined
for
some
time
the
country
on
which
they
had
been
cast
but
it
was
difficult
to
guess
after
so
hasty
an
inspection
what
the
future
had
in
store
for
them
they
then
returned
following
the
southern
crest
of
the
granite
platform
bordered
by
a
long
fringe
of
jagged
rocks
of
the
most
whimsical
shapes
some
hundreds
of
birds
lived
there
nestled
in
the
holes
of
the
stone
herbert
jumping
over
the
rocks
startled
a
whole
flock
of
these
winged
creatures
oh
cried
he
those
are
not
gulls
nor
seamews
what
are
they
then
asked
pencroft
upon
my
word
one
would
say
they
were
pigeons
just
so
but
these
are
wild
or
rock
pigeons
i
recognize
them
by
the
double
band
of
black
on
the
wing
by
the
white
tail
and
by
their
slatecolored
plumage
but
if
the
rockpigeon
is
good
to
eat
its
eggs
must
be
excellent
and
we
will
soon
see
how
many
they
may
have
left
in
their
nests
we
will
not
give
them
time
to
hatch
unless
it
is
in
the
shape
of
an
omelet
replied
pencroft
merrily
but
what
will
you
make
your
omelet
in
asked
herbert
in
your
hat
well
replied
the
sailor
i
am
not
quite
conjuror
enough
for
that
we
must
come
down
to
eggs
in
the
shell
my
boy
and
i
will
undertake
to
despatch
the
hardest
pencroft
and
herbert
attentively
examined
the
cavities
in
the
granite
and
they
really
found
eggs
in
some
of
the
hollows
a
few
dozen
being
collected
were
packed
in
the
sailors
handkerchief
and
as
the
time
when
the
tide
would
be
full
was
approaching
pencroft
and
herbert
began
to
redescend
towards
the
watercourse
when
they
arrived
there
it
was
an
hour
after
midday
the
tide
had
already
turned
they
must
now
avail
themselves
of
the
ebb
to
take
the
wood
to
the
mouth
pencroft
did
not
intend
to
let
the
raft
go
away
in
the
current
without
guidance
neither
did
he
mean
to
embark
on
it
himself
to
steer
it
but
a
sailor
is
never
at
a
loss
when
there
is
a
question
of
cables
or
ropes
and
pencroft
rapidly
twisted
a
cord
a
few
fathoms
long
made
of
dry
creepers
this
vegetable
cable
was
fastened
to
the
afterpart
of
the
raft
and
the
sailor
held
it
in
his
hand
while
herbert
pushing
off
the
raft
with
a
long
pole
kept
it
in
the
current
this
succeeded
capitally
the
enormous
load
of
wood
drifted
down
the
current
the
bank
was
very
equal
there
was
no
fear
that
the
raft
would
run
aground
and
before
two
oclock
they
arrived
at
the
rivers
mouth
a
few
paces
from
the
chimneys
chapter
5
pencrofts
first
care
after
unloading
the
raft
was
to
render
the
cave
habitable
by
stopping
up
all
the
holes
which
made
it
draughty
sand
stones
twisted
branches
wet

closed
up
the
galleries
open
to
the
south
winds
one
narrow
and
winding
opening
at
the
side
was
kept
to
lead
out
the
smoke
and
to
make
the
fire
draw
the
cave
was
thus
divided
into
three
or
four
rooms
if
such
dark
dens
with
which
a
donkey
would
scarcely
have
been
contented
deserved
the
name
but
they
were
dry
and
there
was
space
to
stand
upright
at
least
in
the
principal
room
which
occupied
the
center
the
floor
was
covered
with
fine
sand
and
taking
all
in
all
they
were
well
pleased
with
it
for
want
of
a
better
perhaps
said
herbert
while
he
and
pencroft
were
working
our
companions
have
found
a
superior
place
to
ours
very
likely
replied
the
seaman
but
as
we
dont
know
we
must
work
all
the
same
better
to
have
two
strings
to
ones
bow
than
no
string
at
all
oh
exclaimed
herbert
how
jolly
it
will
be
if
they
were
to
find
captain
harding
and
were
to
bring
him
back
with
them
yes
indeed
said
pencroft
that
was
a
man
of
the
right
sort
was
exclaimed
herbert
do
you
despair
of
ever
seeing
him
again
god
forbid
replied
the
sailor
their
work
was
soon
done
and
pencroft
declared
himself
very
well
satisfied
now
said
he
our
friends
can
come
back
when
they
like
they
will
find
a
good
enough
shelter
they
now
had
only
to
make
a
fireplace
and
to
prepare
the
supperan
easy
task
large
flat
stones
were
placed
on
the
ground
at
the
opening
of
the
narrow
passage
which
had
been
kept
this
if
the
smoke
did
not
take
the
heat
out
with
it
would
be
enough
to
maintain
an
equal
temperature
inside
their
wood
was
stowed
away
in
one
of
the
rooms
and
the
sailor
laid
in
the
fireplace
some
logs
and
brushwood
the
seaman
was
busy
with
this
when
herbert
asked
him
if
he
had
any
matches
certainly
replied
pencroft
and
i
may
say
happily
for
without
matches
or
tinder
we
should
be
in
a
fix
still
we
might
get
fire
as
the
savages
do
replied
herbert
by
rubbing
two
bits
of
dry
stick
one
against
the
other
all
right
try
my
boy
and
lets
see
if
you
can
do
anything
besides
exercising
your
arms
well
its
a
very
simple
proceeding
and
much
used
in
the
islands
of
the
pacific
i
dont
deny
it
replied
pencroft
but
the
savages
must
know
how
to
do
it
or
employ
a
peculiar
wood
for
more
than
once
i
have
tried
to
get
fire
in
that
way
but
i
could
never
manage
it
i
must
say
i
prefer
matches
by
the
bye
where
are
my
matches
pencroft
searched
in
his
waistcoat
for
the
box
which
was
always
there
for
he
was
a
confirmed
smoker
he
could
not
find
it
he
rummaged
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
but
to
his
horror
he
could
nowhere
discover
the
box
heres
a
go
said
he
looking
at
herbert
the
box
must
have
fallen
out
of
my
pocket
and
got
lost
surely
herbert
you
must
have
somethinga
tinderboxanything
that
can
possibly
make
fire
no
i
havent
pencroft
the
sailor
rushed
out
followed
by
the
boy
on
the
sand
among
the
rocks
near
the
rivers
bank
they
both
searched
carefully
but
in
vain
the
box
was
of
copper
and
therefore
would
have
been
easily
seen
pencroft
asked
herbert
didnt
you
throw
it
out
of
the
car
i
knew
better
than
that
replied
the
sailor
but
such
a
small
article
could
easily
disappear
in
the
tumbling
about
we
have
gone
through
i
would
rather
even
have
lost
my
pipe
confound
the
box
where
can
it
be
look
here
the
tide
is
going
down
said
herbert
lets
run
to
the
place
where
we
landed
it
was
scarcely
probable
that
they
would
find
the
box
which
the
waves
had
rolled
about
among
the
pebbles
at
high
tide
but
it
was
as
well
to
try
herbert
and
pencroft
walked
rapidly
to
the
point
where
they
had
landed
the
day
before
about
two
hundred
feet
from
the
cave
they
hunted
there
among
the
shingle
in
the
clefts
of
the
rocks
but
found
nothing
if
the
box
had
fallen
at
this
place
it
must
have
been
swept
away
by
the
waves
as
the
sea
went
down
they
searched
every
little
crevice
with
no
result
it
was
a
grave
loss
in
their
circumstances
and
for
the
time
irreparable
pencroft
could
not
hide
his
vexation
he
looked
very
anxious
but
said
not
a
word
herbert
tried
to
console
him
by
observing
that
if
they
had
found
the
matches
they
would
very
likely
have
been
wetted
by
the
sea
and
useless
no
my
boy
replied
the
sailor
they
were
in
a
copper
box
which
shut
very
tightly
and
now
what
are
we
to
do
we
shall
certainly
find
some
way
of
making
a
fire
said
herbert
captain
harding
or
mr
spilett
will
not
be
without
them
yes
replied
pencroft
but
in
the
meantime
we
are
without
fire
and
our
companions
will
find
but
a
sorry
repast
on
their
return
but
said
herbert
quickly
do
you
think
it
possible
that
they
have
no
tinder
or
matches
i
doubt
it
replied
the
sailor
shaking
his
head
for
neither
neb
nor
captain
harding
smoke
and
i
believe
that
mr
spilett
would
rather
keep
his
notebook
than
his
matchbox
herbert
did
not
reply
the
loss
of
the
box
was
certainly
to
be
regretted
but
the
boy
was
still
sure
of
procuring
fire
in
some
way
or
other
pencroft
more
experienced
did
not
think
so
although
he
was
not
a
man
to
trouble
himself
about
a
small
or
great
grievance
at
any
rate
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
doneto
await
the
return
of
neb
and
the
reporter
but
they
must
give
up
the
feast
of
hard
eggs
which
they
had
meant
to
prepare
and
a
meal
of
raw
flesh
was
not
an
agreeable
prospect
either
for
themselves
or
for
the
others
before
returning
to
the
cave
the
sailor
and
herbert
in
the
event
of
fire
being
positively
unattainable
collected
some
more
shellfish
and
then
silently
retraced
their
steps
to
their
dwelling
pencroft
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
still
looked
for
his
box
he
even
climbed
up
the
left
bank
of
the
river
from
its
mouth
to
the
angle
where
the
raft
had
been
moored
he
returned
to
the
plateau
went
over
it
in
every
direction
searched
among
the
high
grass
on
the
border
of
the
forest
all
in
vain
it
was
five
in
the
evening
when
he
and
herbert
reentered
the
cave
it
is
useless
to
say
that
the
darkest
corners
of
the
passages
were
ransacked
before
they
were
obliged
to
give
it
up
in
despair
towards
six
oclock
when
the
sun
was
disappearing
behind
the
high
lands
of
the
west
herbert
who
was
walking
up
and
down
on
the
strand
signalized
the
return
of
neb
and
spilett
they
were
returning
alone
the
boys
heart
sank
the
sailor
had
not
been
deceived
in
his
forebodings
the
engineer
cyrus
harding
had
not
been
found
the
reporter
on
his
arrival
sat
down
on
a
rock
without
saying
anything
exhausted
with
fatigue
dying
of
hunger
he
had
not
strength
to
utter
a
word
as
to
neb
his
red
eyes
showed
how
he
had
cried
and
the
tears
which
he
could
not
restrain
told
too
clearly
that
he
had
lost
all
hope
the
reporter
recounted
all
that
they
had
done
in
their
attempt
to
recover
cyrus
harding
he
and
neb
had
surveyed
the
coast
for
a
distance
of
eight
miles
and
consequently
much
beyond
the
place
where
the
balloon
had
fallen
the
last
time
but
one
a
fall
which
was
followed
by
the
disappearance
of
the
engineer
and
the
dog
top
the
shore
was
solitary
not
a
vestige
of
a
mark
not
even
a
pebble
recently
displaced
not
a
trace
on
the
sand
not
a
human
footstep
on
all
that
part
of
the
beach
it
was
clear
that
that
portion
of
the
shore
had
never
been
visited
by
a
human
being
the
sea
was
as
deserted
as
the
land
and
it
was
there
a
few
hundred
feet
from
the
coast
that
the
engineer
must
have
found
a
tomb
as
spilett
ended
his
account
neb
jumped
up
exclaiming
in
a
voice
which
showed
how
hope
struggled
within
him
no
he
is
not
dead
he
cant
be
dead
it
might
happen
to
any
one
else
but
never
to
him
he
could
get
out
of
anything
then
his
strength
forsaking
him
oh
i
can
do
no
more
he
murmured
neb
said
herbert
running
to
him
we
will
find
him
god
will
give
him
back
to
us
but
in
the
meantime
you
are
hungry
and
you
must
eat
something
so
saying
he
offered
the
poor
negro
a
few
handfuls
of
shellfish
which
was
indeed
wretched
and
insufficient
food
neb
had
not
eaten
anything
for
several
hours
but
he
refused
them
he
could
not
would
not
live
without
his
master
as
to
gideon
spilett
he
devoured
the
shellfish
then
he
laid
himself
down
on
the
sand
at
the
foot
of
a
rock
he
was
very
weak
but
calm
herbert
went
up
to
him
and
taking
his
hand
sir
said
he
we
have
found
a
shelter
which
will
be
better
than
lying
here
night
is
advancing
come
and
rest
tomorrow
we
will
search
farther
the
reporter
got
up
and
guided
by
the
boy
went
towards
the
cave
on
the
way
pencroft
asked
him
in
the
most
natural
tone
if
by
chance
he
happened
to
have
a
match
or
two
the
reporter
stopped
felt
in
his
pockets
but
finding
nothing
said
i
had
some
but
i
must
have
thrown
them
away
the
seaman
then
put
the
same
question
to
neb
and
received
the
same
answer
confound
it
exclaimed
the
sailor
the
reporter
heard
him
and
seizing
his
arm
have
you
no
matches
he
asked
not
one
and
no
fire
in
consequence
ah
cried
neb
if
my
master
was
here
he
would
know
what
to
do
the
four
castaways
remained
motionless
looking
uneasily
at
each
other
herbert
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
by
saying
mr
spilett
you
are
a
smoker
and
always
have
matches
about
you
perhaps
you
havent
looked
well
try
again
a
single
match
will
be
enough
the
reporter
hunted
again
in
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
waistcoat
and
greatcoat
and
at
last
to
pencrofts
great
joy
no
less
to
his
extreme
surprise
he
felt
a
tiny
piece
of
wood
entangled
in
the
lining
of
his
waistcoat
he
seized
it
with
his
fingers
through
the
stuff
but
he
could
not
get
it
out
if
this
was
a
match
and
a
single
one
it
was
of
great
importance
not
to
rub
off
the
phosphorus
will
you
let
me
try
said
the
boy
and
very
cleverly
without
breaking
it
he
managed
to
draw
out
the
wretched
yet
precious
little
bit
of
wood
which
was
of
such
great
importance
to
these
poor
men
it
was
unused
hurrah
cried
pencroft
it
is
as
good
as
having
a
whole
cargo
he
took
the
match
and
followed
by
his
companions
entered
the
cave
this
small
piece
of
wood
of
which
so
many
in
an
inhabited
country
are
wasted
with
indifference
and
are
of
no
value
must
here
be
used
with
the
greatest
caution
the
sailor
first
made
sure
that
it
was
quite
dry
that
done
we
must
have
some
paper
said
he
here
replied
spilett
after
some
hesitation
tearing
a
leaf
out
of
his
notebook
pencroft
took
the
piece
of
paper
which
the
reporter
held
out
to
him
and
knelt
down
before
the
fireplace
some
handfuls
of
grass
leaves
and
dry
moss
were
placed
under
the
fagots
and
disposed
in
such
a
way
that
the
air
could
easily
circulate
and
the
dry
wood
would
rapidly
catch
fire
pencroft
then
twisted
the
piece
of
paper
into
the
shape
of
a
cone
as
smokers
do
in
a
high
wind
and
poked
it
in
among
the
moss
taking
a
small
rough
stone
he
wiped
it
carefully
and
with
a
beating
heart
holding
his
breath
he
gently
rubbed
the
match
the
first
attempt
did
not
produce
any
effect
pencroft
had
not
struck
hard
enough
fearing
to
rub
off
the
phosphorus
no
i
cant
do
it
said
he
my
hand
trembles
the
match
has
missed
fire
i
cannot
i
will
not
and
rising
he
told
herbert
to
take
his
place
certainly
the
boy
had
never
in
all
his
life
been
so
nervous
prometheus
going
to
steal
the
fire
from
heaven
could
not
have
been
more
anxious
he
did
not
hesitate
however
but
struck
the
match
directly
a
little
spluttering
was
heard
and
a
tiny
blue
flame
sprang
up
making
a
choking
smoke
herbert
quickly
turned
the
match
so
as
to
augment
the
flame
and
then
slipped
it
into
the
paper
cone
which
in
a
few
seconds
too
caught
fire
and
then
the
moss
a
minute
later
the
dry
wood
crackled
and
a
cheerful
flame
assisted
by
the
vigorous
blowing
of
the
sailor
sprang
up
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
at
last
cried
pencroft
getting
up
i
was
never
so
nervous
before
in
all
my
life
the
flat
stones
made
a
capital
fireplace
the
smoke
went
quite
easily
out
at
the
narrow
passage
the
chimney
drew
and
an
agreeable
warmth
was
not
long
in
being
felt
they
must
now
take
great
care
not
to
let
the
fire
go
out
and
always
to
keep
some
embers
alight
it
only
needed
care
and
attention
as
they
had
plenty
of
wood
and
could
renew
their
store
at
any
time
pencrofts
first
thought
was
to
use
the
fire
by
preparing
a
more
nourishing
supper
than
a
dish
of
shellfish
two
dozen
eggs
were
brought
by
herbert
the
reporter
leaning
up
in
a
corner
watched
these
preparations
without
saying
anything
a
threefold
thought
weighed
on
his
mind
was
cyrus
still
alive
if
he
was
alive
where
was
he
if
he
had
survived
from
his
fall
how
was
it
that
he
had
not
found
some
means
of
making
known
his
existence
as
to
neb
he
was
roaming
about
the
shore
he
was
like
a
body
without
a
soul
pencroft
knew
fifty
ways
of
cooking
eggs
but
this
time
he
had
no
choice
and
was
obliged
to
content
himself
with
roasting
them
under
the
hot
cinders
in
a
few
minutes
the
cooking
was
done
and
the
seaman
invited
the
reporter
to
take
his
share
of
the
supper
such
was
the
first
repast
of
the
castaways
on
this
unknown
coast
the
hard
eggs
were
excellent
and
as
eggs
contain
everything
indispensable
to
mans
nourishment
these
poor
people
thought
themselves
well
off
and
were
much
strengthened
by
them
oh
if
only
one
of
them
had
not
been
missing
at
this
meal
if
the
five
prisoners
who
escaped
from
richmond
had
been
all
there
under
the
piledup
rocks
before
this
clear
crackling
fire
on
the
dry
sand
what
thanksgiving
must
they
have
rendered
to
heaven
but
the
most
ingenious
the
most
learned
he
who
was
their
unquestioned
chief
cyrus
harding
was
alas
missing
and
his
body
had
not
even
obtained
a
burialplace
thus
passed
the
25th
of
march
night
had
come
on
outside
could
be
heard
the
howling
of
the
wind
and
the
monotonous
sound
of
the
surf
breaking
on
the
shore
the
waves
rolled
the
shingle
backwards
and
forwards
with
a
deafening
noise
the
reporter
retired
into
a
dark
corner
after
having
shortly
noted
down
the
occurrences
of
the
day
the
first
appearance
of
this
new
land
the
loss
of
their
leader
the
exploration
of
the
coast
the
incident
of
the
matches
etc
and
then
overcome
by
fatigue
he
managed
to
forget
his
sorrows
in
sleep
herbert
went
to
sleep
directly
as
to
the
sailor
he
passed
the
night
with
one
eye
on
the
fire
on
which
he
did
not
spare
fuel
but
one
of
the
castaways
did
not
sleep
in
the
cave
the
inconsolable
despairing
neb
notwithstanding
all
that
his
companions
could
say
to
induce
him
to
take
some
rest
wandered
all
night
long
on
the
shore
calling
on
his
master

the
inventory
of
the
articles
possessed
by
these
castaways
from
the
clouds
thrown
upon
a
coast
which
appeared
to
be
uninhabited
was
soon
made
out
they
had
nothing
save
the
clothes
which
they
were
wearing
at
the
time
of
the
catastrophe
we
must
mention
however
a
notebook
and
a
watch
which
gideon
spilett
had
kept
doubtless
by
inadvertence
not
a
weapon
not
a
tool
not
even
a
pocketknife
for
while
in
the
car
they
had
thrown
out
everything
to
lighten
the
balloon
the
imaginary
heroes
of
daniel
defoe
or
of
wyss
as
well
as
selkirk
and
raynal
shipwrecked
on
juan
fernandez
and
on
the
archipelago
of
the
aucklands
were
never
in
such
absolute
destitution
either
they
had
abundant
resources
from
their
stranded
vessels
in
grain
cattle
tools
ammunition
or
else
some
things
were
thrown
up
on
the
coast
which
supplied
them
with
all
the
first
necessities
of
life
but
here
not
any
instrument
whatever
not
a
utensil
from
nothing
they
must
supply
themselves
with
everything
and
yet
if
cyrus
harding
had
been
with
them
if
the
engineer
could
have
brought
his
practical
science
his
inventive
mind
to
bear
on
their
situation
perhaps
all
hope
would
not
have
been
lost
alas
they
must
hope
no
longer
again
to
see
cyrus
harding
the
castaways
could
expect
nothing
but
from
themselves
and
from
that
providence
which
never
abandons
those
whose
faith
is
sincere
but
ought
they
to
establish
themselves
on
this
part
of
the
coast
without
trying
to
know
to
what
continent
it
belonged
if
it
was
inhabited
or
if
they
were
on
the
shore
of
a
desert
island
it
was
an
important
question
and
should
be
solved
with
the
shortest
possible
delay
from
its
answer
they
would
know
what
measures
to
take
however
according
to
pencrofts
advice
it
appeared
best
to
wait
a
few
days
before
commencing
an
exploration
they
must
in
fact
prepare
some
provisions
and
procure
more
strengthening
food
than
eggs
and
molluscs
the
explorers
before
undertaking
new
fatigues
must
first
of
all
recruit
their
strength
the
chimneys
offered
a
retreat
sufficient
for
the
present
the
fire
was
lighted
and
it
was
easy
to
preserve
some
embers
there
were
plenty
of
shellfish
and
eggs
among
the
rocks
and
on
the
beach
it
would
be
easy
to
kill
a
few
of
the
pigeons
which
were
flying
by
hundreds
about
the
summit
of
the
plateau
either
with
sticks
or
stones
perhaps
the
trees
of
the
neighboring
forest
would
supply
them
with
eatable
fruit
lastly
the
sweet
water
was
there
it
was
accordingly
settled
that
for
a
few
days
they
would
remain
at
the
chimneys
so
as
to
prepare
themselves
for
an
expedition
either
along
the
shore
or
into
the
interior
of
the
country
this
plan
suited
neb
particularly
as
obstinate
in
his
ideas
as
in
his
presentiments
he
was
in
no
haste
to
abandon
this
part
of
the
coast
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
he
did
not
he
would
not
believe
in
the
loss
of
cyrus
harding
no
it
did
not
seem
to
him
possible
that
such
a
man
had
ended
in
this
vulgar
fashion
carried
away
by
a
wave
drowned
in
the
floods
a
few
hundred
feet
from
a
shore
as
long
as
the
waves
had
not
cast
up
the
body
of
the
engineer
as
long
as
he
neb
had
not
seen
with
his
eyes
touched
with
his
hands
the
corpse
of
his
master
he
would
not
believe
in
his
death
and
this
idea
rooted
itself
deeper
than
ever
in
his
determined
heart
an
illusion
perhaps
but
still
an
illusion
to
be
respected
and
one
which
the
sailor
did
not
wish
to
destroy
as
for
him
he
hoped
no
longer
but
there
was
no
use
in
arguing
with
neb
he
was
like
the
dog
who
will
not
leave
the
place
where
his
master
is
buried
and
his
grief
was
such
that
most
probably
he
would
not
survive
him
this
same
morning
the
26th
of
march
at
daybreak
neb
had
set
out
on
the
shore
in
a
northerly
direction
and
he
had
returned
to
the
spot
where
the
sea
no
doubt
had
closed
over
the
unfortunate
harding
that
days
breakfast
was
composed
solely
of
pigeons
eggs
and
lithodomes
herbert
had
found
some
salt
deposited
by
evaporation
in
the
hollows
of
the
rocks
and
this
mineral
was
very
welcome
the
repast
ended
pencroft
asked
the
reporter
if
he
wished
to
accompany
herbert
and
himself
to
the
forest
where
they
were
going
to
try
to
hunt
but
on
consideration
it
was
thought
necessary
that
someone
should
remain
to
keep
in
the
fire
and
to
be
at
hand
in
the
highly
improbable
event
of
neb
requiring
aid
the
reporter
accordingly
remained
behind
to
the
chase
herbert
said
the
sailor
we
shall
find
ammunition
on
our
way
and
cut
our
weapons
in
the
forest
but
at
the
moment
of
starting
herbert
observed
that
since
they
had
no
tinder
it
would
perhaps
be
prudent
to
replace
it
by
another
substance
what
asked
pencroft
burnt
linen
replied
the
boy
that
could
in
case
of
need
serve
for
tinder
the
sailor
thought
it
very
sensible
advice
only
it
had
the
inconvenience
of
necessitating
the
sacrifice
of
a
piece
of
handkerchief
notwithstanding
the
thing
was
well
worth
while
trying
and
a
part
of
pencrofts
large
checked
handkerchief
was
soon
reduced
to
the
state
of
a
halfburnt
rag
this
inflammable
material
was
placed
in
the
central
chamber
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
cavity
in
the
rock
sheltered
from
all
wind
and
damp
it
was
nine
oclock
in
the
morning
the
weather
was
threatening
and
the
breeze
blew
from
the
southeast
herbert
and
pencroft
turned
the
angle
of
the
chimneys
not
without
having
cast
a
look
at
the
smoke
which
just
at
that
place
curled
round
a
point
of
rock
they
ascended
the
left
bank
of
the
river
arrived
at
the
forest
pencroft
broke
from
the
first
tree
two
stout
branches
which
he
transformed
into
clubs
the
ends
of
which
herbert
rubbed
smooth
on
a
rock
oh
what
would
they
not
have
given
for
a
knife
the
two
hunters
now
advanced
among
the
long
grass
following
the
bank
from
the
turning
which
directed
its
course
to
the
southwest
the
river
narrowed
gradually
and
the
channel
lay
between
high
banks
over
which
the
trees
formed
a
double
arch
pencroft
lest
they
should
lose
themselves
resolved
to
follow
the
course
of
the
stream
which
would
always
lead
them
back
to
the
point
from
which
they
started
but
the
bank
was
not
without
some
obstacles
here
the
flexible
branches
of
the
trees
bent
level
with
the
current
there
creepers
and
thorns
which
they
had
to
break
down
with
their
sticks
herbert
often
glided
among
the
broken
stumps
with
the
agility
of
a
young
cat
and
disappeared
in
the
underwood
but
pencroft
called
him
back
directly
begging
him
not
to
wander
away
meanwhile
the
sailor
attentively
observed
the
disposition
and
nature
of
the
surrounding
country
on
the
left
bank
the
ground
which
was
flat
and
marshy
rose
imperceptibly
towards
the
interior
it
looked
there
like
a
network
of
liquid
threads
which
doubtless
reached
the
river
by
some
underground
drain
sometimes
a
stream
ran
through
the
underwood
which
they
crossed
without
difficulty
the
opposite
shore
appeared
to
be
more
uneven
and
the
valley
of
which
the
river
occupied
the
bottom
was
more
clearly
visible
the
hill
covered
with
trees
disposed
in
terraces
intercepted
the
view
on
the
right
bank
walking
would
have
been
difficult
for
the
declivities
fell
suddenly
and
the
trees
bending
over
the
water
were
only
sustained
by
the
strength
of
their
roots
it
is
needless
to
add
that
this
forest
as
well
as
the
coast
already
surveyed
was
destitute
of
any
sign
of
human
life
pencroft
only
saw
traces
of
quadrupeds
fresh
footprints
of
animals
of
which
he
could
not
recognize
the
species
in
all
probability
and
such
was
also
herberts
opinion
some
had
been
left
by
formidable
wild
beasts
which
doubtless
would
give
them
some
trouble
but
nowhere
did
they
observe
the
mark
of
an
axe
on
the
trees
nor
the
ashes
of
a
fire
nor
the
impression
of
a
human
foot
on
this
they
might
probably
congratulate
themselves
for
on
any
land
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
the
presence
of
man
was
perhaps
more
to
be
feared
than
desired
herbert
and
pencroft
speaking
little
for
the
difficulties
of
the
way
were
great
advanced
very
slowly
and
after
walking
for
an
hour
they
had
scarcely
gone
more
than
a
mile
as
yet
the
hunt
had
not
been
successful
however
some
birds
sang
and
fluttered
in
the
foliage
and
appeared
very
timid
as
if
man
had
inspired
them
with
an
instinctive
fear
among
others
herbert
described
in
a
marshy
part
of
the
forest
a
bird
with
a
long
pointed
beak
closely
resembling
the
kingfisher
but
its
plumage
was
not
fine
though
of
a
metallic
brilliancy
that
must
be
a
jacamar
said
herbert
trying
to
get
nearer
this
will
be
a
good
opportunity
to
taste
jacamar
replied
the
sailor
if
that
fellow
is
in
a
humor
to
be
roasted
just
then
a
stone
cleverly
thrown
by
the
boy
struck
the
creature
on
the
wing
but
the
blow
did
not
disable
it
and
the
jacamar
ran
off
and
disappeared
in
an
instant
how
clumsy
i
am
cried
herbert
no
no
my
boy
replied
the
sailor
the
blow
was
well
aimed
many
a
one
would
have
missed
it
altogether
come
dont
be
vexed
with
yourself
we
shall
catch
it
another
day
as
the
hunters
advanced
the
trees
were
found
to
be
more
scattered
many
being
magnificent
but
none
bore
eatable
fruit
pencroft
searched
in
vain
for
some
of
those
precious
palmtrees
which
are
employed
in
so
many
ways
in
domestic
life
and
which
have
been
found
as
far
as
the
fortieth
parallel
in
the
northern
hemisphere
and
to
the
thirtyfifth
only
in
the
southern
hemisphere
but
this
forest
was
only
composed
of
coniferae
such
as
deodaras
already
recognized
by
herbert
and
douglas
pine
similar
to
those
which
grow
on
the
northwest
coast
of
america
and
splendid
firs
measuring
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
height
at
this
moment
a
flock
of
birds
of
a
small
size
and
pretty
plumage
with
long
glancing
tails
dispersed
themselves
among
the
branches
strewing
their
feathers
which
covered
the
ground
as
with
fine
down
herbert
picked
up
a
few
of
these
feathers
and
after
having
examined
them
these
are
couroucous
said
he
i
should
prefer
a
moorcock
or
guineafowl
replied
pencroft
still
if
they
are
good
to
eat
they
are
good
to
eat
and
also
their
flesh
is
very
delicate
replied
herbert
besides
if
i
dont
mistake
it
is
easy
to
approach
and
kill
them
with
a
stick
the
sailor
and
the
lad
creeping
among
the
grass
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
whose
lower
branches
were
covered
with
little
birds
the
couroucous
were
waiting
the
passage
of
insects
which
served
for
their
nourishment
their
feathery
feet
could
be
seen
clasping
the
slender
twigs
which
supported
them
the
hunters
then
rose
and
using
their
sticks
like
scythes
they
mowed
down
whole
rows
of
these
couroucous
who
never
thought
of
flying
away
and
stupidly
allowed
themselves
to
be
knocked
off
a
hundred
were
already
heaped
on
the
ground
before
the
others
made
up
their
minds
to
fly
well
said
pencroft
here
is
game
which
is
quite
within
the
reach
of
hunters
like
us
we
have
only
to
put
out
our
hands
and
take
it
the
sailor
having
strung
the
couroucous
like
larks
on
flexible
twigs
they
then
continued
their
exploration
the
stream
here
made
a
bend
towards
the
south
but
this
detour
was
probably
not
prolonged
for
the
river
must
have
its
source
in
the
mountain
and
be
supplied
by
the
melting
of
the
snow
which
covered
the
sides
of
the
central
cone
the
particular
object
of
their
expedition
was
as
has
been
said
to
procure
the
greatest
possible
quantity
of
game
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
chimneys
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
as
yet
this
object
had
not
been
attained
so
the
sailor
actively
pursued
his
researches
though
he
exclaimed
when
some
animal
which
he
had
not
even
time
to
recognize
fled
into
the
long
grass
if
only
we
had
had
the
dog
top
but
top
had
disappeared
at
the
same
time
as
his
master
and
had
probably
perished
with
him
towards
three
oclock
new
flocks
of
birds
were
seen
through
certain
trees
at
whose
aromatic
berries
they
were
pecking
those
of
the
junipertree
among
others
suddenly
a
loud
trumpet
call
resounded
through
the
forest
this
strange
and
sonorous
cry
was
produced
by
a
game
bird
called
grouse
in
the
united
states
they
soon
saw
several
couples
whose
plumage
was
rich
chestnutbrown
mottled
with
dark
brown
and
tail
of
the
same
color
herbert
recognized
the
males
by
the
two
winglike
appendages
raised
on
the
neck
pencroft
determined
to
get
hold
of
at
least
one
of
these
gallinaceae
which
were
as
large
as
a
fowl
and
whose
flesh
is
better
than
that
of
a
pullet
but
it
was
difficult
for
they
would
not
allow
themselves
to
be
approached
after
several
fruitless
attempts
which
resulted
in
nothing
but
scaring
the
grouse
the
sailor
said
to
the
lad
decidedly
since
we
cant
kill
them
on
the
wing
we
must
try
to
take
them
with
a
line
like
a
fish
cried
herbert
much
surprised
at
the
proposal
like
a
fish
replied
the
sailor
quite
seriously
pencroft
had
found
among
the
grass
half
a
dozen
grouse
nests
each
having
three
or
four
eggs
he
took
great
care
not
to
touch
these
nests
to
which
their
proprietors
would
not
fail
to
return
it
was
around
these
that
he
meant
to
stretch
his
lines
not
snares
but
real
fishinglines
he
took
herbert
to
some
distance
from
the
nests
and
there
prepared
his
singular
apparatus
with
all
the
care
which
a
disciple
of
izaak
walton
would
have
used
herbert
watched
the
work
with
great
interest
though
rather
doubting
its
success
the
lines
were
made
of
fine
creepers
fastened
one
to
the
other
of
the
length
of
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
thick
strong
thorns
the
points
bent
back
which
were
supplied
from
a
dwarf
acacia
bush
were
fastened
to
the
ends
of
the
creepers
by
way
of
hooks
large
red
worms
which
were
crawling
on
the
ground
furnished
bait
this
done
pencroft
passing
among
the
grass
and
concealing
himself
skillfully
placed
the
end
of
his
lines
armed
with
hooks
near
the
grouse
nests
then
he
returned
took
the
other
ends
and
hid
with
herbert
behind
a
large
tree
there
they
both
waited
patiently
though
it
must
be
said
that
herbert
did
not
reckon
much
on
the
success
of
the
inventive
pencroft
a
whole
halfhour
passed
but
then
as
the
sailor
had
surmised
several
couple
of
grouse
returned
to
their
nests
they
walked
along
pecking
the
ground
and
not
suspecting
in
any
way
the
presence
of
the
hunters
who
besides
had
taken
care
to
place
themselves
to
leeward
of
the
gallinaceae
the
lad
felt
at
this
moment
highly
interested
he
held
his
breath
and
pencroft
his
eyes
staring
his
mouth
open
his
lips
advanced
as
if
about
to
taste
a
piece
of
grouse
scarcely
breathed
meanwhile
the
birds
walked
about
the
hooks
without
taking
any
notice
of
them
pencroft
then
gave
little
tugs
which
moved
the
bait
as
if
the
worms
had
been
still
alive
the
sailor
undoubtedly
felt
much
greater
anxiety
than
does
the
fisherman
for
he
does
not
see
his
prey
coming
through
the
water
the
jerks
attracted
the
attention
of
the
gallinaceae
and
they
attacked
the
hooks
with
their
beaks
three
voracious
grouse
swallowed
at
the
same
moment
bait
and
hook
suddenly
with
a
smart
jerk
pencroft
struck
his
line
and
a
flapping
of
wings
showed
that
the
birds
were
taken
hurrah
he
cried
rushing
towards
the
game
of
which
he
made
himself
master
in
an
instant
herbert
clapped
his
hands
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
seen
birds
taken
with
a
line
but
the
sailor
modestly
confessed
that
it
was
not
his
first
attempt
and
that
besides
he
could
not
claim
the
merit
of
invention
and
at
any
rate
added
he
situated
as
we
are
we
must
hope
to
hit
upon
many
other
contrivances
the
grouse
were
fastened
by
their
claws
and
pencroft
delighted
at
not
having
to
appear
before
their
companions
with
empty
hands
and
observing
that
the
day
had
begun
to
decline
judged
it
best
to
return
to
their
dwelling
the
direction
was
indicated
by
the
river
whose
course
they
had
only
to
follow
and
towards
six
oclock
tired
enough
with
their
excursion
herbert
and
pencroft
arrived
at
the
chimneys
chapter
7
gideon
spilett
was
standing
motionless
on
the
shore
his
arms
crossed
gazing
over
the
sea
the
horizon
of
which
was
lost
towards
the
east
in
a
thick
black
cloud
which
was
spreading
rapidly
towards
the
zenith
the
wind
was
already
strong
and
increased
with
the
decline
of
day
the
whole
sky
was
of
a
threatening
aspect
and
the
first
symptoms
of
a
violent
storm
were
clearly
visible
herbert
entered
the
chimneys
and
pencroft
went
towards
the
reporter
the
latter
deeply
absorbed
did
not
see
him
approach
we
are
going
to
have
a
dirty
night
mr
spilett
said
the
sailor
petrels
delight
in
wind
and
rain
the
reporter
turning
at
the
moment
saw
pencroft
and
his
first
words
were
at
what
distance
from
the
coast
would
you
say
the
car
was
when
the
waves
carried
off
our
companion
the
sailor
had
not
expected
this
question
he
reflected
an
instant
and
replied
two
cables
lengths
at
the
most
but
what
is
a
cables
length
asked
gideon
spilett
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
fathoms
or
six
hundred
feet
then
said
the
reporter
cyrus
harding
must
have
disappeared
twelve
hundred
feet
at
the
most
from
the
shore
about
that
replied
pencroft
and
his
dog
also
also
what
astonishes
me
rejoined
the
reporter
while
admitting
that
our
companion
has
perished
is
that
top
has
also
met
his
death
and
that
neither
the
body
of
the
dog
nor
of
his
master
has
been
cast
on
the
shore
it
is
not
astonishing
with
such
a
heavy
sea
replied
the
sailor
besides
it
is
possible
that
currents
have
carried
them
farther
down
the
coast
then
it
is
your
opinion
that
our
friend
has
perished
in
the
waves
again
asked
the
reporter
that
is
my
opinion
my
own
opinion
said
gideon
spilett
with
due
deference
to
your
experience
pencroft
is
that
in
the
double
fact
of
the
absolute
disappearance
of
cyrus
and
top
living
or
dead
there
is
something
unaccountable
and
unlikely
i
wish
i
could
think
like
you
mr
spilett
replied
pencroft
unhappily
my
mind
is
made
up
on
this
point
having
said
this
the
sailor
returned
to
the
chimneys
a
good
fire
crackled
on
the
hearth
herbert
had
just
thrown
on
an
armful
of
dry
wood
and
the
flame
cast
a
bright
light
into
the
darkest
parts
of
the
passage
pencroft
immediately
began
to
prepare
the
dinner
it
appeared
best
to
introduce
something
solid
into
the
bill
of
fare
for
all
needed
to
get
up
their
strength
the
strings
of
couroucous
were
kept
for
the
next
day
but
they
plucked
a
couple
of
grouse
which
were
soon
spitted
on
a
stick
and
roasting
before
a
blazing
fire
at
seven
in
the
evening
neb
had
not
returned
the
prolonged
absence
of
the
negro
made
pencroft
very
uneasy
it
was
to
be
feared
that
he
had
met
with
an
accident
on
this
unknown
land
or
that
the
unhappy
fellow
had
been
driven
to
some
act
of
despair
but
herbert
drew
very
different
conclusions
from
this
absence
according
to
him
nebs
delay
was
caused
by
some
new
circumstances
which
had
induced
him
to
prolong
his
search
also
everything
new
must
be
to
the
advantage
of
cyrus
harding
why
had
neb
not
returned
unless
hope
still
detained
him
perhaps
he
had
found
some
mark
a
footstep
a
trace
which
had
put
him
in
the
right
path
perhaps
he
was
at
this
moment
on
a
certain
track
perhaps
even
he
was
near
his
master
thus
the
lad
reasoned
thus
he
spoke
his
companions
let
him
talk
the
reporter
alone
approved
with
a
gesture
but
what
pencroft
thought
most
probable
was
that
neb
had
pushed
his
researches
on
the
shore
farther
than
the
day
before
and
that
he
had
not
as
yet
had
time
to
return
herbert
however
agitated
by
vague
presentiments
several
times
manifested
an
intention
to
go
to
meet
neb
but
pencroft
assured
him
that
that
would
be
a
useless
course
that
in
the
darkness
and
deplorable
weather
he
could
not
find
any
traces
of
neb
and
that
it
would
be
much
better
to
wait
if
neb
had
not
made
his
appearance
by
the
next
day
pencroft
would
not
hesitate
to
join
him
in
his
search
gideon
spilett
approved
of
the
sailors
opinion
that
it
was
best
not
to
divide
and
herbert
was
obliged
to
give
up
his
project
but
two
large
tears
fell
from
his
eyes
the
reporter
could
not
refrain
from
embracing
the
generous
boy
bad
weather
now
set
in
a
furious
gale
from
the
southeast
passed
over
the
coast
the
sea
roared
as
it
beat
over
the
reef
heavy
rain
was
dashed
by
the
storm
into
particles
like
dust
ragged
masses
of
vapor
drove
along
the
beach
on
which
the
tormented
shingles
sounded
as
if
poured
out
in
cartloads
while
the
sand
raised
by
the
wind
added
as
it
were
mineral
dust
to
that
which
was
liquid
and
rendered
the
united
attack
insupportable
between
the
rivers
mouth
and
the
end
of
the
cliff
eddies
of
wind
whirled
and
gusts
from
this
maelstrom
lashed
the
water
which
ran
through
the
narrow
valley
the
smoke
from
the
fireplace
was
also
driven
back
through
the
opening
filling
the
passages
and
rendering
them
uninhabitable
therefore
as
the
grouse
were
cooked
pencroft
let
the
fire
die
away
and
only
preserved
a
few
embers
buried
under
the
ashes
at
eight
oclock
neb
had
not
appeared
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
frightful
weather
alone
hindered
his
return
and
that
he
must
have
taken
refuge
in
some
cave
to
await
the
end
of
the
storm
or
at
least
the
return
of
day
as
to
going
to
meet
him
or
attempting
to
find
him
it
was
impossible
the
game
constituted
the
only
dish
at
supper
the
meat
was
excellent
and
pencroft
and
herbert
whose
long
excursion
had
rendered
them
very
hungry
devoured
it
with
infinite
satisfaction
their
meal
concluded
each
retired
to
the
corner
in
which
he
had
rested
the
preceding
night
and
herbert
was
not
long
in
going
to
sleep
near
the
sailor
who
had
stretched
himself
beside
the
fireplace
outside
as
the
night
advanced
the
tempest
also
increased
in
strength
until
it
was
equal
to
that
which
had
carried
the
prisoners
from
richmond
to
this
land
in
the
pacific
the
tempests
which
are
frequent
during
the
seasons
of
the
equinox
and
which
are
so
prolific
in
catastrophes
are
above
all
terrible
over
this
immense
ocean
which
opposes
no
obstacle
to
their
fury
no
description
can
give
an
idea
of
the
terrific
violence
of
the
gale
as
it
beat
upon
the
unprotected
coast
happily
the
pile
of
rocks
which
formed
the
chimneys
was
solid
it
was
composed
of
enormous
blocks
of
granite
a
few
of
which
insecurely
balanced
seemed
to
tremble
on
their
foundations
and
pencroft
could
feel
rapid
quiverings
under
his
head
as
it
rested
on
the
rock
but
he
repeated
to
himself
and
rightly
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
and
that
their
retreat
would
not
give
way
however
he
heard
the
noise
of
stones
torn
from
the
summit
of
the
plateau
by
the
wind
falling
down
on
to
the
beach
a
few
even
rolled
on
to
the
upper
part
of
the
chimneys
or
flew
off
in
fragments
when
they
were
projected
perpendicularly
twice
the
sailor
rose
and
intrenched
himself
at
the
opening
of
the
passage
so
as
to
take
a
look
in
safety
at
the
outside
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
from
these
showers
which
were
not
considerable
and
he
returned
to
his
couch
before
the
fireplace
where
the
embers
glowed
beneath
the
ashes
notwithstanding
the
fury
of
the
hurricane
the
uproar
of
the
tempest
the
thunder
and
the
tumult
herbert
slept
profoundly
sleep
at
last
took
possession
of
pencroft
whom
a
seafaring
life
had
habituated
to
anything
gideon
spilett
alone
was
kept
awake
by
anxiety
he
reproached
himself
with
not
having
accompanied
neb
it
was
evident
that
he
had
not
abandoned
all
hope
the
presentiments
which
had
troubled
herbert
did
not
cease
to
agitate
him
also
his
thoughts
were
concentrated
on
neb
why
had
neb
not
returned
he
tossed
about
on
his
sandy
couch
scarcely
giving
a
thought
to
the
struggle
of
the
elements
now
and
then
his
eyes
heavy
with
fatigue
closed
for
an
instant
but
some
sudden
thought
reopened
them
almost
immediately
meanwhile
the
night
advanced
and
it
was
perhaps
two
hours
from
morning
when
pencroft
then
sound
asleep
was
vigorously
shaken
whats
the
matter
he
cried
rousing
himself
and
collecting
his
ideas
with
the
promptitude
usual
to
seamen
the
reporter
was
leaning
over
him
and
saying
listen
pencroft
listen
the
sailor
strained
his
ears
but
could
hear
no
noise
beyond
those
caused
by
the
storm
it
is
the
wind
said
he
no
replied
gideon
spilett
listening
again
i
thought
i
heard
what
the
barking
of
a
dog
a
dog
cried
pencroft
springing
up
yesbarking
its
not
possible
replied
the
sailor
and
besides
how
in
the
roaring
of
the
storm
stoplisten
said
the
reporter
pencroft
listened
more
attentively
and
really
thought
he
heard
during
a
lull
distant
barking
well
said
the
reporter
pressing
the
sailors
hand
yesyes
replied
pencroft
it
is
top
it
is
top
cried
herbert
who
had
just
awoke
and
all
three
rushed
towards
the
opening
of
the
chimneys
they
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
out
the
wind
drove
them
back
but
at
last
they
succeeded
and
could
only
remain
standing
by
leaning
against
the
rocks
they
looked
about
but
could
not
speak
the
darkness
was
intense
the
sea
the
sky
the
land
were
all
mingled
in
one
black
mass
not
a
speck
of
light
was
visible
the
reporter
and
his
companions
remained
thus
for
a
few
minutes
overwhelmed
by
the
wind
drenched
by
the
rain
blinded
by
the
sand
then
in
a
pause
of
the
tumult
they
again
heard
the
barking
which
they
found
must
be
at
some
distance
it
could
only
be
top
but
was
he
alone
or
accompanied
he
was
most
probably
alone
for
if
neb
had
been
with
him
he
would
have
made
his
way
more
directly
towards
the
chimneys
the
sailor
squeezed
the
reporters
hand
for
he
could
not
make
himself
heard
in
a
way
which
signified
wait
then
he
reentered
the
passage
an
instant
after
he
issued
with
a
lighted
fagot
which
he
threw
into
the
darkness
whistling
shrilly
it
appeared
as
if
this
signal
had
been
waited
for
the
barking
immediately
came
nearer
and
soon
a
dog
bounded
into
the
passage
pencroft
herbert
and
spilett
entered
after
him
an
armful
of
dry
wood
was
thrown
on
the
embers
the
passage
was
lighted
up
with
a
bright
flame
it
is
top
cried
herbert
it
was
indeed
top
a
magnificent
anglonorman
who
derived
from
these
two
races
crossed
the
swiftness
of
foot
and
the
acuteness
of
smell
which
are
the
preeminent
qualities
of
coursing
dogs
it
was
the
dog
of
the
engineer
cyrus
harding
but
he
was
alone
neither
neb
nor
his
master
accompanied
him
how
was
it
that
his
instinct
had
guided
him
straight
to
the
chimneys
which
he
did
not
know
it
appeared
inexplicable
above
all
in
the
midst
of
this
black
night
and
in
such
a
tempest
but
what
was
still
more
inexplicable
was
that
top
was
neither
tired
nor
exhausted
nor
even
soiled
with
mud
or
sandherbert
had
drawn
him
towards
him
and
was
patting
his
head
the
dog
rubbing
his
neck
against
the
lads
hands
if
the
dog
is
found
the
master
will
be
found
also
said
the
reporter
god
grant
it
responded
herbert
let
us
set
off
top
will
guide
us
pencroft
did
not
make
any
objection
he
felt
that
tops
arrival
contradicted
his
conjectures
come
along
then
said
he
pencroft
carefully
covered
the
embers
on
the
hearth
he
placed
a
few
pieces
of
wood
among
them
so
as
to
keep
in
the
fire
until
their
return
then
preceded
by
the
dog
who
seemed
to
invite
them
by
short
barks
to
come
with
him
and
followed
by
the
reporter
and
the
boy
he
dashed
out
after
having
put
up
in
his
handkerchief
the
remains
of
the
supper
the
storm
was
then
in
all
its
violence
and
perhaps
at
its
height
not
a
single
ray
of
light
from
the
moon
pierced
through
the
clouds
to
follow
a
straight
course
was
difficult
it
was
best
to
rely
on
tops
instinct
they
did
so
the
reporter
and
herbert
walked
behind
the
dog
and
the
sailor
brought
up
the
rear
it
was
impossible
to
exchange
a
word
the
rain
was
not
very
heavy
but
the
wind
was
terrific
however
one
circumstance
favored
the
seaman
and
his
two
companions
the
wind
being
southeast
consequently
blew
on
their
backs
the
clouds
of
sand
which
otherwise
would
have
been
insupportable
from
being
received
behind
did
not
in
consequence
impede
their
progress
in
short
they
sometimes
went
faster
than
they
liked
and
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
their
feet
but
hope
gave
them
strength
for
it
was
not
at
random
that
they
made
their
way
along
the
shore
they
had
no
doubt
that
neb
had
found
his
master
and
that
he
had
sent
them
the
faithful
dog
but
was
the
engineer
living
or
had
neb
only
sent
for
his
companions
that
they
might
render
the
last
duties
to
the
corpse
of
the
unfortunate
harding
after
having
passed
the
precipice
herbert
the
reporter
and
pencroft
prudently
stepped
aside
to
stop
and
take
breath
the
turn
of
the
rocks
sheltered
them
from
the
wind
and
they
could
breathe
after
this
walk
or
rather
run
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
could
now
hear
and
reply
to
each
other
and
the
lad
having
pronounced
the
name
of
cyrus
harding
top
gave
a
few
short
barks
as
much
as
to
say
that
his
master
was
saved
saved
isnt
he
repeated
herbert
saved
top
and
the
dog
barked
in
reply
they
once
more
set
out
the
tide
began
to
rise
and
urged
by
the
wind
it
threatened
to
be
unusually
high
as
it
was
a
spring
tide
great
billows
thundered
against
the
reef
with
such
violence
that
they
probably
passed
entirely
over
the
islet
then
quite
invisible
the
mole
no
longer
protected
the
coast
which
was
directly
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
the
open
sea
as
soon
as
the
sailor
and
his
companions
left
the
precipice
the
wind
struck
them
again
with
renewed
fury
though
bent
under
the
gale
they
walked
very
quickly
following
top
who
did
not
hesitate
as
to
what
direction
to
take
they
ascended
towards
the
north
having
on
their
left
an
interminable
extent
of
billows
which
broke
with
a
deafening
noise
and
on
their
right
a
dark
country
the
aspect
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
guess
but
they
felt
that
it
was
comparatively
flat
for
the
wind
passed
completely
over
them
without
being
driven
back
as
it
was
when
it
came
in
contact
with
the
cliff
at
four
oclock
in
the
morning
they
reckoned
that
they
had
cleared
about
five
miles
the
clouds
were
slightly
raised
and
the
wind
though
less
damp
was
very
sharp
and
cold
insufficiently
protected
by
their
clothing
pencroft
herbert
and
spilett
suffered
cruelly
but
not
a
complaint
escaped
their
lips
they
were
determined
to
follow
top
wherever
the
intelligent
animal
wished
to
lead
them
towards
five
oclock
day
began
to
break
at
the
zenith
where
the
fog
was
less
thick
gray
shades
bordered
the
clouds
under
an
opaque
belt
a
luminous
line
clearly
traced
the
horizon
the
crests
of
the
billows
were
tipped
with
a
wild
light
and
the
foam
regained
its
whiteness
at
the
same
time
on
the
left
the
hilly
parts
of
the
coast
could
be
seen
though
very
indistinctly
at
six
oclock
day
had
broken
the
clouds
rapidly
lifted
the
seaman
and
his
companions
were
then
about
six
miles
from
the
chimneys
they
were
following
a
very
flat
shore
bounded
by
a
reef
of
rocks
whose
heads
scarcely
emerged
from
the
sea
for
they
were
in
deep
water
on
the
left
the
country
appeared
to
be
one
vast
extent
of
sandy
downs
bristling
with
thistles
there
was
no
cliff
and
the
shore
offered
no
resistance
to
the
ocean
but
a
chain
of
irregular
hillocks
here
and
there
grew
two
or
three
trees
inclined
towards
the
west
their
branches
projecting
in
that
direction
quite
behind
in
the
southwest
extended
the
border
of
the
forest
at
this
moment
top
became
very
excited
he
ran
forward
then
returned
and
seemed
to
entreat
them
to
hasten
their
steps
the
dog
then
left
the
beach
and
guided
by
his
wonderful
instinct
without
showing
the
least
hesitation
went
straight
in
among
the
downs
they
followed
him
the
country
appeared
an
absolute
desert
not
a
living
creature
was
to
be
seen
the
downs
the
extent
of
which
was
large
were
composed
of
hillocks
and
even
of
hills
very
irregularly
distributed
they
resembled
a
switzerland
modeled
in
sand
and
only
an
amazing
instinct
could
have
possibly
recognized
the
way
five
minutes
after
having
left
the
beach
the
reporter
and
his
two
companions
arrived
at
a
sort
of
excavation
hollowed
out
at
the
back
of
a
high
mound
there
top
stopped
and
gave
a
loud
clear
bark

and
pencroft
dashed
into
the
cave
neb
was
there
kneeling
beside
a
body
extended
on
a
bed
of
grass
the
body
was
that
of

neb
did
not
move
pencroft
only
uttered
one
word
living
he
cried
neb
did
not
reply
spilett
and
the
sailor
turned
pale
herbert
clasped
his
hands
and
remained
motionless
the
poor
negro
absorbed
in
his
grief
evidently
had
neither
seen
his
companions
nor
heard
the
sailor
speak
the
reporter
knelt
down
beside
the
motionless
body
and
placed
his
ear
to
the
engineers
chest
having
first
torn
open
his
clothes
a
minutean
agepassed
during
which
he
endeavored
to
catch
the
faintest
throb
of
the
heart
neb
had
raised
himself
a
little
and
gazed
without
seeing
despair
had
completely
changed
his
countenance
he
could
scarcely
be
recognized
exhausted
with
fatigue
broken
with
grief
he
believed
his
master
was
dead
gideon
spilett
at
last
rose
after
a
long
and
attentive
examination
he
lives
said
he
pencroft
knelt
in
his
turn
beside
the
engineer
he
also
heard
a
throbbing
and
even
felt
a
slight
breath
on
his
cheek
herbert
at
a
word
from
the
reporter
ran
out
to
look
for
water
he
found
a
hundred
feet
off
a
limpid
stream
which
seemed
to
have
been
greatly
increased
by
the
rains
and
which
filtered
through
the
sand
but
nothing
in
which
to
put
the
water
not
even
a
shell
among
the
downs
the
lad
was
obliged
to
content
himself
with
dipping
his
handkerchief
in
the
stream
and
with
it
hastened
back
to
the
grotto
happily
the
wet
handkerchief
was
enough
for
gideon
spilett
who
only
wished
to
wet
the
engineers
lips
the
cold
water
produced
an
almost
immediate
effect
his
chest
heaved
and
he
seemed
to
try
to
speak
we
will
save
him
exclaimed
the
reporter
at
these
words
hope
revived
in
nebs
heart
he
undressed
his
master
to
see
if
he
was
wounded
but
not
so
much
as
a
bruise
was
to
be
found
either
on
the
head
body
or
limbs
which
was
surprising
as
he
must
have
been
dashed
against
the
rocks
even
the
hands
were
uninjured
and
it
was
difficult
to
explain
how
the
engineer
showed
no
traces
of
the
efforts
which
he
must
have
made
to
get
out
of
reach
of
the
breakers
but
the
explanation
would
come
later
when
cyrus
was
able
to
speak
he
would
say
what
had
happened
for
the
present
the
question
was
how
to
recall
him
to
life
and
it
appeared
likely
that
rubbing
would
bring
this
about
so
they
set
to
work
with
the
sailors
jersey
the
engineer
revived
by
this
rude
shampooing
moved
his
arm
slightly
and
began
to
breathe
more
regularly
he
was
sinking
from
exhaustion
and
certainly
had
not
the
reporter
and
his
companions
arrived
it
would
have
been
all
over
with
cyrus
harding
you
thought
your
master
was
dead
didnt
you
said
the
seaman
to
neb
yes
quite
dead
replied
neb
and
if
top
had
not
found
you
and
brought
you
here
i
should
have
buried
my
master
and
then
have
lain
down
on
his
grave
to
die
it
had
indeed
been
a
narrow
escape
for
cyrus
harding
neb
then
recounted
what
had
happened
the
day
before
after
having
left
the
chimneys
at
daybreak
he
had
ascended
the
coast
in
a
northerly
direction
and
had
reached
that
part
of
the
shore
which
he
had
already
visited
there
without
any
hope
he
acknowledged
neb
had
searched
the
beach
among
the
rocks
on
the
sand
for
the
smallest
trace
to
guide
him
he
examined
particularly
that
part
of
the
beach
which
was
not
covered
by
the
high
tide
for
near
the
sea
the
water
would
have
obliterated
all
marks
neb
did
not
expect
to
find
his
master
living
it
was
for
a
corpse
that
he
searched
a
corpse
which
he
wished
to
bury
with
his
own
hands
he
sought
long
in
vain
this
desert
coast
appeared
never
to
have
been
visited
by
a
human
creature
the
shells
those
which
the
sea
had
not
reached
and
which
might
be
met
with
by
millions
above
highwater
mark
were
untouched
not
a
shell
was
broken
neb
then
resolved
to
walk
along
the
beach
for
some
miles
it
was
possible
that
the
waves
had
carried
the
body
to
quite
a
distant
point
when
a
corpse
floats
a
little
distance
from
a
low
shore
it
rarely
happens
that
the
tide
does
not
throw
it
up
sooner
or
later
this
neb
knew
and
he
wished
to
see
his
master
again
for
the
last
time
i
went
along
the
coast
for
another
two
miles
carefully
examining
the
beach
both
at
high
and
low
water
and
i
had
despaired
of
finding
anything
when
yesterday
above
five
in
the
evening
i
saw
footprints
on
the
sand
footprints
exclaimed
pencroft
yes
replied
neb
did
these
footprints
begin
at
the
waters
edge
asked
the
reporter
no
replied
neb
only
above
highwater
mark
for
the
others
must
have
been
washed
out
by
the
tide
go
on
neb
said
spilett
i
went
half
crazy
when
i
saw
these
footprints
they
were
very
clear
and
went
towards
the
downs
i
followed
them
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
running
but
taking
care
not
to
destroy
them
five
minutes
after
as
it
was
getting
dark
i
heard
the
barking
of
a
dog
it
was
top
and
top
brought
me
here
to
my
master
neb
ended
his
account
by
saying
what
had
been
his
grief
at
finding
the
inanimate
body
in
which
he
vainly
sought
for
the
least
sign
of
life
now
that
he
had
found
him
dead
he
longed
for
him
to
be
alive
all
his
efforts
were
useless
nothing
remained
to
be
done
but
to
render
the
last
duties
to
the
one
whom
he
had
loved
so
much
neb
then
thought
of
his
companions
they
no
doubt
would
wish
to
see
the
unfortunate
man
again
top
was
there
could
he
not
rely
on
the
sagacity
of
the
faithful
animal
neb
several
times
pronounced
the
name
of
the
reporter
the
one
among
his
companions
whom
top
knew
best
then
he
pointed
to
the
south
and
the
dog
bounded
off
in
the
direction
indicated
to
him
we
have
heard
how
guided
by
an
instinct
which
might
be
looked
upon
almost
as
supernatural
top
had
found
them
nebs
companions
had
listened
with
great
attention
to
this
account
it
was
unaccountable
to
them
how
cyrus
harding
after
the
efforts
which
he
must
have
made
to
escape
from
the
waves
by
crossing
the
rocks
had
not
received
even
a
scratch
and
what
could
not
be
explained
either
was
how
the
engineer
had
managed
to
get
to
this
cave
in
the
downs
more
than
a
mile
from
the
shore
so
neb
said
the
reporter
it
was
not
you
who
brought
your
master
to
this
place
no
it
was
not
i
replied
the
negro
its
very
clear
that
the
captain
came
here
by
himself
said
pencroft
it
is
clear
in
reality
observed
spilett
but
it
is
not
credible
the
explanation
of
this
fact
could
only
be
produced
from
the
engineers
own
lips
and
they
must
wait
for
that
till
speech
returned
rubbing
had
reestablished
the
circulation
of
the
blood
cyrus
harding
moved
his
arm
again
then
his
head
and
a
few
incomprehensible
words
escaped
him
neb
who
was
bending
over
him
spoke
but
the
engineer
did
not
appear
to
hear
and
his
eyes
remained
closed
life
was
only
exhibited
in
him
by
movement
his
senses
had
not
as
yet
been
restored
pencroft
much
regretted
not
having
either
fire
or
the
means
of
procuring
it
for
he
had
unfortunately
forgotten
to
bring
the
burnt
linen
which
would
easily
have
ignited
from
the
sparks
produced
by
striking
together
two
flints
as
to
the
engineers
pockets
they
were
entirely
empty
except
that
of
his
waistcoat
which
contained
his
watch
it
was
necessary
to
carry
harding
to
the
chimneys
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
this
was
the
opinion
of
all
meanwhile
the
care
which
was
lavished
on
the
engineer
brought
him
back
to
consciousness
sooner
than
they
could
have
expected
the
water
with
which
they
wetted
his
lips
revived
him
gradually
pencroft
also
thought
of
mixing
with
the
water
some
moisture
from
the
titras
flesh
which
he
had
brought
herbert
ran
to
the
beach
and
returned
with
two
large
bivalve
shells
the
sailor
concocted
something
which
he
introduced
between
the
lips
of
the
engineer
who
eagerly
drinking
it
opened
his
eyes
neb
and
the
reporter
were
leaning
over
him
my
master
my
master
cried
neb
the
engineer
heard
him
he
recognized
neb
and
spilett
then
his
other
two
companions
and
his
hand
slightly
pressed
theirs
a
few
words
again
escaped
him
which
showed
what
thoughts
were
even
then
troubling
his
brain
this
time
he
was
understood
undoubtedly
they
were
the
same
words
he
had
before
attempted
to
utter
island
or
continent
he
murmured
bother
the
continent
cried
pencroft
hastily
there
is
time
enough
to
see
about
that
captain
we
dont
care
for
anything
provided
you
are
living
the
engineer
nodded
faintly
and
then
appeared
to
sleep
they
respected
this
sleep
and
the
reporter
began
immediately
to
make
arrangements
for
transporting
harding
to
a
more
comfortable
place
neb
herbert
and
pencroft
left
the
cave
and
directed
their
steps
towards
a
high
mound
crowned
with
a
few
distorted
trees
on
the
way
the
sailor
could
not
help
repeating
island
or
continent
to
think
of
that
when
at
ones
last
gasp
what
a
man
arrived
at
the
summit
of
the
mound
pencroft
and
his
two
companions
set
to
work
with
no
other
tools
than
their
hands
to
despoil
of
its
principal
branches
a
rather
sickly
tree
a
sort
of
marine
fir
with
these
branches
they
made
a
litter
on
which
covered
with
grass
and
leaves
they
could
carry
the
engineer
this
occupied
them
nearly
forty
minutes
and
it
was
ten
oclock
when
they
returned
to
cyrus
harding
whom
spilett
had
not
left
the
engineer
was
just
awaking
from
the
sleep
or
rather
from
the
drowsiness
in
which
they
had
found
him
the
color
was
returning
to
his
cheeks
which
till
now
had
been
as
pale
as
death
he
raised
himself
a
little
looked
around
him
and
appeared
to
ask
where
he
was
can
you
listen
to
me
without
fatigue
cyrus
asked
the
reporter
yes
replied
the
engineer
its
my
opinion
said
the
sailor
that
captain
harding
will
be
able
to
listen
to
you
still
better
if
he
will
have
some
more
grouse
jellyfor
we
have
grouse
captain
added
he
presenting
him
with
a
little
of
this
jelly
to
which
he
this
time
added
some
of
the
flesh
cyrus
harding
ate
a
little
of
the
grouse
and
the
rest
was
divided
among
his
companions
who
found
it
but
a
meager
breakfast
for
they
were
suffering
extremely
from
hunger
well
said
the
sailor
there
is
plenty
of
food
at
the
chimneys
for
you
must
know
captain
that
down
there
in
the
south
we
have
a
house
with
rooms
beds
and
fireplace
and
in
the
pantry
several
dozen
of
birds
which
our
herbert
calls
couroucous
your
litter
is
ready
and
as
soon
as
you
feel
strong
enough
we
will
carry
you
home
thanks
my
friend
replied
the
engineer
wait
another
hour
or
two
and
then
we
will
set
out
and
now
speak
spilett
the
reporter
then
told
him
all
that
had
occurred
he
recounted
all
the
events
with
which
cyrus
was
unacquainted
the
last
fall
of
the
balloon
the
landing
on
this
unknown
land
which
appeared
a
desert
whatever
it
was
whether
island
or
continent
the
discovery
of
the
chimneys
the
search
for
him
not
forgetting
of
course
nebs
devotion
the
intelligence
exhibited
by
the
faithful
top
as
well
as
many
other
matters
but
asked
harding
in
a
still
feeble
voice
you
did
not
then
pick
me
up
on
the
beach
no
replied
the
reporter
and
did
you
not
bring
me
to
this
cave
no
at
what
distance
is
this
cave
from
the
sea
about
a
mile
replied
pencroft
and
if
you
are
astonished
captain
we
are
not
less
surprised
ourselves
at
seeing
you
in
this
place
indeed
said
the
engineer
who
was
recovering
gradually
and
who
took
great
interest
in
these
details
indeed
it
is
very
singular
but
resumed
the
sailor
can
you
tell
us
what
happened
after
you
were
carried
off
by
the
sea
cyrus
harding
considered
he
knew
very
little
the
wave
had
torn
him
from
the
balloon
net
he
sank
at
first
several
fathoms
on
returning
to
the
surface
in
the
half
light
he
felt
a
living
creature
struggling
near
him
it
was
top
who
had
sprung
to
his
help
he
saw
nothing
of
the
balloon
which
lightened
both
of
his
weight
and
that
of
the
dog
had
darted
away
like
an
arrow
there
he
was
in
the
midst
of
the
angry
sea
at
a
distance
which
could
not
be
less
than
half
a
mile
from
the
shore
he
attempted
to
struggle
against
the
billows
by
swimming
vigorously
top
held
him
up
by
his
clothes
but
a
strong
current
seized
him
and
drove
him
towards
the
north
and
after
half
an
hour
of
exertion
he
sank
dragging
top
with
him
into
the
depths
from
that
moment
to
the
moment
in
which
he
recovered
to
find
himself
in
the
arms
of
his
friends
he
remembered
nothing
however
remarked
pencroft
you
must
have
been
thrown
on
to
the
beach
and
you
must
have
had
strength
to
walk
here
since
neb
found
your
footmarks
yes
of
course
replied
the
engineer
thoughtfully
and
you
found
no
traces
of
human
beings
on
this
coast
not
a
trace
replied
the
reporter
besides
if
by
chance
you
had
met
with
some
deliverer
there
just
in
the
nick
of
time
why
should
he
have
abandoned
you
after
having
saved
you
from
the
waves
you
are
right
my
dear
spilett
tell
me
neb
added
the
engineer
turning
to
his
servant
it
was
not
you
who
you
cant
have
had
a
moment
of
unconsciousness
during
which
no
thats
absurd
do
any
of
the
footsteps
still
remain
asked
harding
yes
master
replied
neb
here
at
the
entrance
at
the
back
of
the
mound
in
a
place
sheltered
from
the
rain
and
wind
the
storm
has
destroyed
the
others
pencroft
said
cyrus
harding
will
you
take
my
shoe
and
see
if
it
fits
exactly
to
the
footprints
the
sailor
did
as
the
engineer
requested
while
he
and
herbert
guided
by
neb
went
to
the
place
where
the
footprints
were
to
be
found
cyrus
remarked
to
the
reporter
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
thing
perfectly
inexplicable
replied
gideon
spilett
but
do
not
dwell
upon
it
just
now
my
dear
spilett
we
will
talk
about
it
byandby
a
moment
after
the
others
entered
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
engineers
shoe
fitted
exactly
to
the
footmarks
it
was
therefore
cyrus
harding
who
had
left
them
on
the
sand
come
said
he
i
must
have
experienced
this
unconsciousness
which
i
attributed
to
neb
i
must
have
walked
like
a
somnambulist
without
any
knowledge
of
my
steps
and
top
must
have
guided
me
here
after
having
dragged
me
from
the
waves
come
top
come
old
dog
the
magnificent
animal
bounded
barking
to
his
master
and
caresses
were
lavished
on
him
it
was
agreed
that
there
was
no
other
way
of
accounting
for
the
rescue
of
cyrus
harding
and
that
top
deserved
all
the
honor
of
the
affair
towards
twelve
oclock
pencroft
having
asked
the
engineer
if
they
could
now
remove
him
harding
instead
of
replying
and
by
an
effort
which
exhibited
the
most
energetic
will
got
up
but
he
was
obliged
to
lean
on
the
sailor
or
he
would
have
fallen
well
done
cried
pencroft
bring
the
captains
litter
the
litter
was
brought
the
transverse
branches
had
been
covered
with
leaves
and
long
grass
harding
was
laid
on
it
and
pencroft
having
taken
his
place
at
one
end
and
neb
at
the
other
they
started
towards
the
coast
there
was
a
distance
of
eight
miles
to
be
accomplished
but
as
they
could
not
go
fast
and
it
would
perhaps
be
necessary
to
stop
frequently
they
reckoned
that
it
would
take
at
least
six
hours
to
reach
the
chimneys
the
wind
was
still
strong
but
fortunately
it
did
not
rain
although
lying
down
the
engineer
leaning
on
his
elbow
observed
the
coast
particularly
inland
he
did
not
speak
but
he
gazed
and
no
doubt
the
appearance
of
the
country
with
its
inequalities
of
ground
its
forests
its
various
productions
were
impressed
on
his
mind
however
after
traveling
for
two
hours
fatigue
overcame
him
and
he
slept
at
halfpast
five
the
little
band
arrived
at
the
precipice
and
a
short
time
after
at
the
chimneys
they
stopped
and
the
litter
was
placed
on
the
sand
cyrus
harding
was
sleeping
profoundly
and
did
not
awake
pencroft
to
his
extreme
surprise
found
that
the
terrible
storm
had
quite
altered
the
aspect
of
the
place
important
changes
had
occurred
great
blocks
of
stone
lay
on
the
beach
which
was
also
covered
with
a
thick
carpet
of
seaweed
algae
and
wrack
evidently
the
sea
passing
over
the
islet
had
been
carried
right
up
to
the
foot
of
the
enormous
curtain
of
granite
the
soil
in
front
of
the
cave
had
been
torn
away
by
the
violence
of
the
waves
a
horrid
presentiment
flashed
across
pencrofts
mind
he
rushed
into
the
passage
but
returned
almost
immediately
and
stood
motionless
staring
at
his
companions
the
fire
was
out
the
drowned
cinders
were
nothing
but
mud
the
burnt
linen
which
was
to
have
served
as
tinder
had
disappeared
the
sea
had
penetrated
to
the
end
of
the
passages
and
everything
was
overthrown
and
destroyed
in
the
interior
of
the
chimneys
chapter
9
in
a
few
words
gideon
spilett
herbert
and
neb
were
made
acquainted
with
what
had
happened
this
accident
which
appeared
so
very
serious
to
pencroft
produced
different
effects
on
the
companions
of
the
honest
sailor
neb
in
his
delight
at
having
found
his
master
did
not
listen
or
rather
did
not
care
to
trouble
himself
with
what
pencroft
was
saying
herbert
shared
in
some
degree
the
sailors
feelings
as
to
the
reporter
he
simply
replied
upon
my
word
pencroft
its
perfectly
indifferent
to
me
but
i
repeat
that
we
havent
any
fire
pooh
nor
any
means
of
relighting
it
nonsense
but
i
say
mr
spilett
isnt
cyrus
here
replied
the
reporter
is
not
our
engineer
alive
he
will
soon
find
some
way
of
making
fire
for
us
with
what
with
nothing
what
had
pencroft
to
say
he
could
say
nothing
for
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
shared
the
confidence
which
his
companions
had
in
cyrus
harding
the
engineer
was
to
them
a
microcosm
a
compound
of
every
science
a
possessor
of
all
human
knowledge
it
was
better
to
be
with
cyrus
in
a
desert
island
than
without
him
in
the
most
flourishing
town
in
the
united
states
with
him
they
could
want
nothing
with
him
they
would
never
despair
if
these
brave
men
had
been
told
that
a
volcanic
eruption
would
destroy
the
land
that
this
land
would
be
engulfed
in
the
depths
of
the
pacific
they
would
have
imperturbably
replied
cyrus
is
here
while
in
the
palanquin
however
the
engineer
had
again
relapsed
into
unconsciousness
which
the
jolting
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
during
his
journey
had
brought
on
so
that
they
could
not
now
appeal
to
his
ingenuity
the
supper
must
necessarily
be
very
meager
in
fact
all
the
grouse
flesh
had
been
consumed
and
there
no
longer
existed
any
means
of
cooking
more
game
besides
the
couroucous
which
had
been
reserved
had
disappeared
they
must
consider
what
was
to
be
done
first
of
all
cyrus
harding
was
carried
into
the
central
passage
there
they
managed
to
arrange
for
him
a
couch
of
seaweed
which
still
remained
almost
dry
the
deep
sleep
which
had
overpowered
him
would
no
doubt
be
more
beneficial
to
him
than
any
nourishment
night
had
closed
in
and
the
temperature
which
had
modified
when
the
wind
shifted
to
the
northwest
again
became
extremely
cold
also
the
sea
having
destroyed
the
partitions
which
pencroft
had
put
up
in
certain
places
in
the
passages
the
chimneys
on
account
of
the
draughts
had
become
scarcely
habitable
the
engineers
condition
would
therefore
have
been
bad
enough
if
his
companions
had
not
carefully
covered
him
with
their
coats
and
waistcoats
supper
this
evening
was
of
course
composed
of
the
inevitable
lithodomes
of
which
herbert
and
neb
picked
up
a
plentiful
supply
on
the
beach
however
to
these
molluscs
the
lad
added
some
edible
seaweed
which
he
gathered
on
high
rocks
whose
sides
were
only
washed
by
the
sea
at
the
time
of
high
tides
this
seaweed
which
belongs
to
the
order
of
fucacae
of
the
genus
sargassum
produces
when
dry
a
gelatinous
matter
rich
and
nutritious
the
reporter
and
his
companions
after
having
eaten
a
quantity
of
lithodomes
sucked
the
sargassum
of
which
the
taste
was
very
tolerable
it
is
used
in
parts
of
the
east
very
considerably
by
the
natives
never
mind
said
the
sailor
the
captain
will
help
us
soon
meanwhile
the
cold
became
very
severe
and
unhappily
they
had
no
means
of
defending
themselves
from
it
the
sailor
extremely
vexed
tried
in
all
sorts
of
ways
to
procure
fire
neb
helped
him
in
this
work
he
found
some
dry
moss
and
by
striking
together
two
pebbles
he
obtained
some
sparks
but
the
moss
not
being
inflammable
enough
did
not
take
fire
for
the
sparks
were
really
only
incandescent
and
not
at
all
of
the
same
consistency
as
those
which
are
emitted
from
flint
when
struck
in
the
same
manner
the
experiment
therefore
did
not
succeed
pencroft
although
he
had
no
confidence
in
the
proceeding
then
tried
rubbing
two
pieces
of
dry
wood
together
as
savages
do
certainly
the
movement
which
he
and
neb
exhibited
if
it
had
been
transformed
into
heat
according
to
the
new
theory
would
have
been
enough
to
heat
the
boiler
of
a
steamer
it
came
to
nothing
the
bits
of
wood
became
hot
to
be
sure
but
much
less
so
than
the
operators
themselves
after
working
an
hour
pencroft
who
was
in
a
complete
state
of
perspiration
threw
down
the
pieces
of
wood
in
disgust
i
can
never
be
made
to
believe
that
savages
light
their
fires
in
this
way
let
them
say
what
they
will
he
exclaimed
i
could
sooner
light
my
arms
by
rubbing
them
against
each
other
the
sailor
was
wrong
to
despise
the
proceeding
savages
often
kindle
wood
by
means
of
rapid
rubbing
but
every
sort
of
wood
does
not
answer
for
the
purpose
and
besides
there
is
the
knack
following
the
usual
expression
and
it
is
probable
that
pencroft
had
not
the
knack
pencrofts
ill
humor
did
not
last
long
herbert
had
taken
the
bits
of
wood
which
he
had
turned
down
and
was
exerting
himself
to
rub
them
the
hardy
sailor
could
not
restrain
a
burst
of
laughter
on
seeing
the
efforts
of
the
lad
to
succeed
where
he
had
failed
rub
my
boy
rub
said
he
i
am
rubbing
replied
herbert
laughing
but
i
dont
pretend
to
do
anything
else
but
warm
myself
instead
of
shivering
and
soon
i
shall
be
as
hot
as
you
are
my
good
pencroft
this
soon
happened
however
they
were
obliged
to
give
up
for
this
night
at
least
the
attempt
to
procure
fire
gideon
spilett
repeated
for
the
twentieth
time
that
cyrus
harding
would
not
have
been
troubled
for
so
small
a
difficulty
and
in
the
meantime
he
stretched
himself
in
one
of
the
passages
on
his
bed
of
sand
herbert
neb
and
pencroft
did
the
same
while
top
slept
at
his
masters
feet
next
day
the
28th
of
march
when
the
engineer
awoke
about
eight
in
the
morning
he
saw
his
companions
around
him
watching
his
sleep
and
as
on
the
day
before
his
first
words
were
island
or
continent
this
was
his
uppermost
thought
well
replied
pencroft
we
dont
know
anything
about
it
captain
you
dont
know
yet
but
we
shall
know
rejoined
pencroft
when
you
have
guided
us
into
the
country
i
think
i
am
able
to
try
it
replied
the
engineer
who
without
much
effort
rose
and
stood
upright
thats
capital
cried
the
sailor
i
feel
dreadfully
weak
replied
harding
give
me
something
to
eat
my
friends
and
it
will
soon
go
off
you
have
fire
havent
you
this
question
was
not
immediately
replied
to
but
in
a
few
seconds
alas
we
have
no
fire
said
pencroft
or
rather
captain
we
have
it
no
longer
and
the
sailor
recounted
all
that
had
passed
the
day
before
he
amused
the
engineer
by
the
history
of
the
single
match
then
his
abortive
attempt
to
procure
fire
in
the
savages
way
we
shall
consider
replied
the
engineer
and
if
we
do
not
find
some
substance
similar
to
tinder
well
asked
the
sailor
well
we
will
make
matches
chemicals
chemicals
it
is
not
more
difficult
than
that
cried
the
reporter
striking
the
sailor
on
the
shoulder
the
latter
did
not
think
it
so
simple
but
he
did
not
protest
all
went
out
the
weather
had
become
very
fine
the
sun
was
rising
from
the
seas
horizon
and
touched
with
golden
spangles
the
prismatic
rugosities
of
the
huge
precipice
having
thrown
a
rapid
glance
around
him
the
engineer
seated
himself
on
a
block
of
stone
herbert
offered
him
a
few
handfuls
of
shellfish
and
sargassum
saying
it
is
all
that
we
have
captain
harding
thanks
my
boy
replied
harding
it
will
dofor
this
morning
at
least
he
ate
the
wretched
food
with
appetite
and
washed
it
down
with
a
little
fresh
water
drawn
from
the
river
in
an
immense
shell
his
companions
looked
at
him
without
speaking
then
feeling
somewhat
refreshed
cyrus
harding
crossed
his
arms
and
said
so
my
friends
you
do
not
know
yet
whether
fate
has
thrown
us
on
an
island
or
on
a
continent
no
captain
replied
the
boy
we
shall
know
tomorrow
said
the
engineer
till
then
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
yes
replied
pencroft
what
fire
said
the
sailor
who
also
had
a
fixed
idea
we
will
make
it
pencroft
replied
harding
while
you
were
carrying
me
yesterday
did
i
not
see
in
the
west
a
mountain
which
commands
the
country
yes
replied
spilett
a
mountain
which
must
be
rather
high
well
replied
the
engineer
we
will
climb
to
the
summit
tomorrow
and
then
we
shall
see
if
this
land
is
an
island
or
a
continent
till
then
i
repeat
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
yes
fire
said
the
obstinate
sailor
again
but
he
will
make
us
a
fire
replied
gideon
spilett
only
have
a
little
patience
pencroft
the
seaman
looked
at
spilett
in
a
way
which
seemed
to
say
if
it
depended
upon
you
to
do
it
we
wouldnt
taste
roast
meat
very
soon
but
he
was
silent
meanwhile
captain
harding
had
made
no
reply
he
appeared
to
be
very
little
troubled
by
the
question
of
fire
for
a
few
minutes
he
remained
absorbed
in
thought
then
again
speaking
my
friends
said
he
our
situation
is
perhaps
deplorable
but
at
any
rate
it
is
very
plain
either
we
are
on
a
continent
and
then
at
the
expense
of
greater
or
less
fatigue
we
shall
reach
some
inhabited
place
or
we
are
on
an
island
in
the
latter
case
if
the
island
is
inhabited
we
will
try
to
get
out
of
the
scrape
with
the
help
of
its
inhabitants
if
it
is
desert
we
will
try
to
get
out
of
the
scrape
by
ourselves
certainly
nothing
could
be
plainer
replied
pencroft
but
whether
it
is
an
island
or
a
continent
asked
gideon
spilett
whereabouts
do
you
think
cyrus
this
storm
has
thrown
us
i
cannot
say
exactly
replied
the
engineer
but
i
presume
it
is
some
land
in
the
pacific
in
fact
when
we
left
richmond
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
northeast
and
its
very
violence
greatly
proves
that
it
could
not
have
varied
if
the
direction
has
been
maintained
from
the
northeast
to
the
southwest
we
have
traversed
the
states
of
north
carolina
of
south
carolina
of
georgia
the
gulf
of
mexico
mexico
itself
in
its
narrow
part
then
a
part
of
the
pacific
ocean
i
cannot
estimate
the
distance
traversed
by
the
balloon
at
less
than
six
to
seven
thousand
miles
and
even
supposing
that
the
wind
had
varied
half
a
quarter
it
must
have
brought
us
either
to
the
archipelago
of
mendava
either
on
the
pomotous
or
even
if
it
had
a
greater
strength
than
i
suppose
to
the
land
of
new
zealand
if
the
last
hypothesis
is
correct
it
will
be
easy
enough
to
get
home
again
english
or
maoris
we
shall
always
find
some
one
to
whom
we
can
speak
if
on
the
contrary
this
is
the
coast
of
a
desert
island
in
some
tiny
archipelago
perhaps
we
shall
be
able
to
reconnoiter
it
from
the
summit
of
that
peak
which
overlooks
the
country
and
then
we
shall
see
how
best
to
establish
ourselves
here
as
if
we
are
never
to
go
away
never
cried
the
reporter
you
say
never
my
dear
cyrus
better
to
put
things
at
the
worst
at
first
replied
the
engineer
and
reserve
the
best
for
a
surprise
well
said
remarked
pencroft
it
is
to
be
hoped
too
that
this
island
if
it
be
one
is
not
situated
just
out
of
the
course
of
ships
that
would
be
really
unlucky
we
shall
not
know
what
we
have
to
rely
on
until
we
have
first
made
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
replied
the
engineer
but
tomorrow
captain
asked
herbert
shall
you
be
in
a
state
to
bear
the
fatigue
of
the
ascent
i
hope
so
replied
the
engineer
provided
you
and
pencroft
my
boy
show
yourselves
quick
and
clever
hunters
captain
said
the
sailor
since
you
are
speaking
of
game
if
on
my
return
i
was
as
certain
of
roasting
it
as
i
am
of
bringing
it
back
bring
it
back
all
the
same
pencroft
replied
harding
it
was
then
agreed
that
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
were
to
pass
the
day
at
the
chimneys
so
as
to
examine
the
shore
and
the
upper
plateau
neb
herbert
and
the
sailor
were
to
return
to
the
forest
renew
their
store
of
wood
and
lay
violent
hands
on
every
creature
feathered
or
hairy
which
might
come
within
their
reach
they
set
out
accordingly
about
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
herbert
confident
neb
joyous
pencroft
murmuring
aside
if
on
my
return
i
find
a
fire
at
the
house
i
shall
believe
that
the
thunder
itself
came
to
light
it
all
three
climbed
the
bank
and
arrived
at
the
angle
made
by
the
river
the
sailor
stopping
said
to
his
two
companions
shall
we
begin
by
being
hunters
or
woodmen
hunters
replied
herbert
there
is
top
already
in
quest
we
will
hunt
then
said
the
sailor
and
afterwards
we
can
come
back
and
collect
our
wood
this
agreed
to
herbert
neb
and
pencroft
after
having
torn
three
sticks
from
the
trunk
of
a
young
fir
followed
top
who
was
bounding
about
among
the
long
grass
this
time
the
hunters
instead
of
following
the
course
of
the
river
plunged
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
there
were
still
the
same
trees
belonging
for
the
most
part
to
the
pine
family
in
certain
places
less
crowded
growing
in
clumps
these
pines
exhibited
considerable
dimensions
and
appeared
to
indicate
by
their
development
that
the
country
was
situated
in
a
higher
latitude
than
the
engineer
had
supposed
glades
bristling
with
stumps
worn
away
by
time
were
covered
with
dry
wood
which
formed
an
inexhaustible
store
of
fuel
then
the
glade
passed
the
underwood
thickened
again
and
became
almost
impenetrable
it
was
difficult
enough
to
find
the
way
among
the
groups
of
trees
without
any
beaten
track
so
the
sailor
from
time
to
time
broke
off
branches
which
might
be
easily
recognized
but
perhaps
he
was
wrong
not
to
follow
the
watercourse
as
he
and
herbert
had
done
on
their
first
excursion
for
after
walking
an
hour
not
a
creature
had
shown
itself
top
running
under
the
branches
only
roused
birds
which
could
not
be
approached
even
the
couroucous
were
invisible
and
it
was
probable
that
the
sailor
would
be
obliged
to
return
to
the
marshy
part
of
the
forest
in
which
he
had
so
happily
performed
his
grouse
fishing
well
pencroft
said
neb
in
a
slightly
sarcastic
tone
if
this
is
all
the
game
which
you
promised
to
bring
back
to
my
master
it
wont
need
a
large
fire
to
roast
it
have
patience
replied
the
sailor
it
isnt
the
game
which
will
be
wanting
on
our
return
have
you
not
confidence
in
captain
harding
yes
but
you
dont
believe
that
he
will
make
fire
i
shall
believe
it
when
the
wood
is
blazing
in
the
fireplace
it
will
blaze
since
my
master
has
said
so
we
shall
see
meanwhile
the
sun
had
not
reached
the
highest
point
in
its
course
above
the
horizon
the
exploration
therefore
continued
and
was
usefully
marked
by
a
discovery
which
herbert
made
of
a
tree
whose
fruit
was
edible
this
was
the
stonepine
which
produces
an
excellent
almond
very
much
esteemed
in
the
temperate
regions
of
america
and
europe
these
almonds
were
in
a
perfect
state
of
maturity
and
herbert
described
them
to
his
companions
who
feasted
on
them
come
said
pencroft
seaweed
by
way
of
bread
raw
mussels
for
meat
and
almonds
for
dessert
thats
certainly
a
good
dinner
for
those
who
have
not
a
single
match
in
their
pocket
we
mustnt
complain
said
herbert
i
am
not
complaining
my
boy
replied
pencroft
only
i
repeat
that
meat
is
a
little
too
much
economized
in
this
sort
of
meal
top
has
found
something
cried
neb
who
ran
towards
a
thicket
in
the
midst
of
which
the
dog
had
disappeared
barking
with
tops
barking
were
mingled
curious
gruntings
the
sailor
and
herbert
had
followed
neb
if
there
was
game
there
this
was
not
the
time
to
discuss
how
it
was
to
be
cooked
but
rather
how
they
were
to
get
hold
of
it
the
hunters
had
scarcely
entered
the
bushes
when
they
saw
top
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
an
animal
which
he
was
holding
by
the
ear
this
quadruped
was
a
sort
of
pig
nearly
two
feet
and
a
half
long
of
a
blackish
brown
color
lighter
below
having
hard
scanty
hair
its
toes
then
strongly
fixed
in
the
ground
seemed
to
be
united
by
a
membrane
herbert
recognized
in
this
animal
the
capybara
that
is
to
say
one
of
the
largest
members
of
the
rodent
order
meanwhile
the
capybara
did
not
struggle
against
the
dog
it
stupidly
rolled
its
eyes
deeply
buried
in
a
thick
bed
of
fat
perhaps
it
saw
men
for
the
first
time
however
neb
having
tightened
his
grasp
on
his
stick
was
just
going
to
fell
the
pig
when
the
latter
tearing
itself
from
tops
teeth
by
which
it
was
only
held
by
the
tip
of
its
ear
uttered
a
vigorous
grunt
rushed
upon
herbert
almost
overthrew
him
and
disappeared
in
the
wood
the
rascal
cried
pencroft
all
three
directly
darted
after
top
but
at
the
moment
when
they
joined
him
the
animal
had
disappeared
under
the
waters
of
a
large
pond
shaded
by
venerable
pines
neb
herbert
and
pencroft
stopped
motionless
top
plunged
into
the
water
but
the
capybara
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
the
pond
did
not
appear
let
us
wait
said
the
boy
for
he
will
soon
come
to
the
surface
to
breathe
wont
he
drown
asked
neb
no
replied
herbert
since
he
has
webbed
feet
and
is
almost
an
amphibious
animal
but
watch
him
top
remained
in
the
water
pencroft
and
his
two
companions
went
to
different
parts
of
the
bank
so
as
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
capybara
which
the
dog
was
looking
for
beneath
the
water
herbert
was
not
mistaken
in
a
few
minutes

of
the
water
top
was
upon
it
in
a
bound
and
kept
it
from
plunging
again
an
instant
later
the
capybara
dragged
to
the
bank
was
killed
by
a
blow
from
nebs

hurrah
cried
pencroft
who
was
always
ready
with
this
cry
of
triumph
give
me
but
a
good
fire
and
this
pig
shall
be
gnawed
to
the
bones
pencroft
hoisted
the
capybara
on
his
shoulders
and
judging
by
the
height
of
the
sun
that
it
was
about
two
oclock
he
gave
the
signal
to
return
tops
instinct
was
useful
to
the
hunters
who
thanks
to
the
intelligent
animal
were
enabled
to
discover
the
road
by
which
they
had
come
half
an
hour
later
they
arrived
at
the
river
pencroft
soon
made
a
raft
of
wood
as
he
had
done
before
though
if
there
was
no
fire
it
would
be
a
useless
task
and
the
raft
following
the
current
they
returned
towards
the
chimneys
but
the
sailor
had
not
gone
fifty
paces
when
he
stopped
and
again
uttering
a
tremendous
hurrah
pointed
towards
the
angle
of
the
cliff
herbert
neb

shouted
smoke
was
escaping
and
curling
up
among
the
rocks
chapter
10
in
a
few
minutes
the
three
hunters
were
before
a
crackling
fire
the
captain
and
the
reporter
were
there
pencroft
looked
from
one
to
the
other
his
capybara
in
his
hand
without
saying
a
word
well
yes
my
brave
fellow
cried
the
reporter
fire
real
fire
which
will
roast
this
splendid
pig
perfectly
and
we
will
have
a
feast
presently
but
who
lighted
it
asked
pencroft
the
sun
gideon
spilett
was
quite
right
in
his
reply
it
was
the
sun
which
had
furnished
the
heat
which
so
astonished
pencroft
the
sailor
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
and
he
was
so
amazed
that
he
did
not
think
of
questioning
the
engineer
had
you
a
burningglass
sir
asked
herbert
of
harding
no
my
boy
replied
he
but
i
made
one
and
he
showed
the
apparatus
which
served
for
a
burningglass
it
was
simply
two
glasses
which
he
had
taken
from
his
own
and
the
reporters
watches
having
filled
them
with
water
and
rendered
their
edges
adhesive
by
means
of
a
little
clay
he
thus
fabricated
a
regular
burningglass
which
concentrating
the
solar
rays
on
some
very
dry
moss
soon
caused
it
to
blaze
the
sailor
considered
the
apparatus
then
he
gazed
at
the
engineer
without
saying
a
word
only
a
look
plainly
expressed
his
opinion
that
if
cyrus
harding
was
not
a
magician
he
was
certainly
no
ordinary
man
at
last
speech
returned
to
him
and
he
cried
note
that
mr
spilett
note
that
down
on
your
paper
it
is
noted
replied
the
reporter
then
neb
helping
him
the
seaman
arranged
the
spit
and
the
capybara
properly
cleaned
was
soon
roasting
like
a
sucklingpig
before
a
clear
crackling
fire
the
chimneys
had
again
become
more
habitable
not
only
because
the
passages
were
warmed
by
the
fire
but
because
the
partitions
of
wood
and
mud
had
been
reestablished
it
was
evident
that
the
engineer
and
his
companions
had
employed
their
day
well
cyrus
harding
had
almost
entirely
recovered
his
strength
and
had
proved
it
by
climbing
to
the
upper
plateau
from
this
point
his
eye
accustomed
to
estimate
heights
and
distances
was
fixed
for
a
long
time
on
the
cone
the
summit
of
which
he
wished
to
reach
the
next
day
the
mountain
situated
about
six
miles
to
the
northwest
appeared
to
him
to
measure
3500
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
consequently
the
gaze
of
an
observer
posted
on
its
summit
would
extend
over
a
radius
of
at
least
fifty
miles
therefore
it
was
probable
that
harding
could
easily
solve
the
question
of
island
or
continent
to
which
he
attached
so
much
importance
they
supped
capitally
the
flesh
of
the
capybara
was
declared
excellent
the
sargassum
and
the
almonds
of
the
stonepine
completed
the
repast
during
which
the
engineer
spoke
little
he
was
preoccupied
with
projects
for
the
next
day
once
or
twice
pencroft
gave
forth
some
ideas
upon
what
it
would
be
best
to
do
but
cyrus
harding
who
was
evidently
of
a
methodical
mind
only
shook
his
head
without
uttering
a
word
tomorrow
he
repeated
we
shall
know
what
we
have
to
depend
upon
and
we
will
act
accordingly
the
meal
ended
fresh
armfuls
of
wood
were
thrown
on
the
fire
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
chimneys
including
the
faithful
top
were
soon
buried
in
a
deep
sleep
no
incident
disturbed
this
peaceful
night
and
the
next
day
the
29th
of
march
fresh
and
active
they
awoke
ready
to
undertake
the
excursion
which
must
determine
their
fate
all
was
ready
for
the
start
the
remains
of
the
capybara
would
be
enough
to
sustain
harding
and
his
companions
for
at
least
twentyfour
hours
besides
they
hoped
to
find
more
food
on
the
way
as
the
glasses
had
been
returned
to
the
watches
of
the
engineer
and
reporter
pencroft
burned
a
little
linen
to
serve
as
tinder
as
to
flint
that
would
not
be
wanting
in
these
regions
of
plutonic
origin
it
was
halfpast
seven
in
the
morning
when
the
explorers
armed
with
sticks
left
the
chimneys
following
pencrofts
advice
it
appeared
best
to
take
the
road
already
traversed
through
the
forest
and
to
return
by
another
route
it
was
also
the
most
direct
way
to
reach
the
mountain
they
turned
the
south
angle
and
followed
the
left
bank
of
the
river
which
was
abandoned
at
the
point
where
it
formed
an
elbow
towards
the
southwest
the
path
already
trodden
under
the
evergreen
trees
was
found
and
at
nine
oclock
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
had
reached
the
western
border
of
the
forest
the
ground
till
then
very
little
undulated
boggy
at
first
dry
and
sandy
afterwards
had
a
gentle
slope
which
ascended
from
the
shore
towards
the
interior
of
the
country
a
few
very
timid
animals
were
seen
under
the
foresttrees
top
quickly
started
them
but
his
master
soon
called
him
back
for
the
time
had
not
come
to
commence
hunting
that
would
be
attended
to
later
the
engineer
was
not
a
man
who
would
allow
himself
to
be
diverted
from
his
fixed
idea
it
might
even
have
been
said
that
he
did
not
observe
the
country
at
all
either
in
its
configuration
or
in
its
natural
productions
his
great
aim
being
to
climb
the
mountain
before
him
and
therefore
straight
towards
it
he
went
at
ten
oclock
a
halt
of
a
few
minutes
was
made
on
leaving
the
forest
the
mountain
system
of
the
country
appeared
before
the
explorers
the
mountain
was
composed
of
two
cones
the
first
truncated
at
a
height
of
about
two
thousand
five
hundred
feet
was
sustained
by
buttresses
which
appeared
to
branch
out
like
the
talons
of
an
immense
claw
set
on
the
ground
between
these
were
narrow
valleys
bristling
with
trees
the
last
clumps
of
which
rose
to
the
top
of
the
lowest
cone
there
appeared
to
be
less
vegetation
on
that
side
of
the
mountain
which
was
exposed
to
the
northeast
and
deep
fissures
could
be
seen
which
no
doubt
were
watercourses
on
the
first
cone
rested
a
second
slightly
rounded
and
placed
a
little
on
one
side
like
a
great
round
hat
cocked
over
the
ear
a
scotchman
would
have
said
his
bonnet
was
a
thocht
ajee
it
appeared
formed
of
bare
earth
here
and
there
pierced
by
reddish
rocks
they
wished
to
reach
the
second
cone
and
proceeding
along
the
ridge
of
the
spurs
seemed
to
be
the
best
way
by
which
to
gain
it
we
are
on
volcanic
ground
cyrus
harding
had
said
and
his
companions
following
him
began
to
ascend
by
degrees
on
the
back
of
a
spur
which
by
a
winding
and
consequently
more
accessible
path
joined
the
first
plateau
the
ground
had
evidently
been
convulsed
by
subterranean
force
here
and
there
stray
blocks
numerous
debris
of
basalt
and
pumicestone
were
met
with
in
isolated
groups
rose
firtrees
which
some
hundred
feet
lower
at
the
bottom
of
the
narrow
gorges
formed
massive
shades
almost
impenetrable
to
the
suns
rays
during
the
first
part
of
the
ascent
herbert
remarked
on
the
footprints
which
indicated
the
recent
passage
of
large
animals
perhaps
these
beasts
will
not
let
us
pass
by
willingly
said
pencroft
well
replied
the
reporter
who
had
already
hunted
the
tiger
in
india
and
the
lion
in
africa
we
shall
soon
learn
how
successfully
to
encounter
them
but
in
the
meantime
we
must
be
upon
our
guard
they
ascended
but
slowly
the
distance
increased
by
detours
and
obstacles
which
could
not
be
surmounted
directly
was
long
sometimes
too
the
ground
suddenly
fell
and
they
found
themselves
on
the
edge
of
a
deep
chasm
which
they
had
to
go
round
thus
in
retracing
their
steps
so
as
to
find
some
practicable
path
much
time
was
employed
and
fatigue
undergone
for
nothing
at
twelve
oclock
when
the
small
band
of
adventurers
halted
for
breakfast
at
the
foot
of
a
large
group
of
firs
near
a
little
stream
which
fell
in
cascades
they
found
themselves
still
half
way
from
the
first
plateau
which
most
probably
they
would
not
reach
till
nightfall
from
this
point
the
view
of
the
sea
was
much
extended
but
on
the
right
the
high
promontory
prevented
their
seeing
whether
there
was
land
beyond
it
on
the
left
the
sight
extended
several
miles
to
the
north
but
on
the
northwest
at
the
point
occupied
by
the
explorers
it
was
cut
short
by
the
ridge
of
a
fantasticallyshaped
spur
which
formed
a
powerful
support
of
the
central
cone
at
one
oclock
the
ascent
was
continued
they
slanted
more
towards
the
southwest
and
again
entered
among
thick
bushes
there
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
fluttered
several
couples
of
gallinaceae
belonging
to
the
pheasant
species
they
were
tragopans
ornamented
by
a
pendant
skin
which
hangs
over
their
throats
and
by
two
small
round
horns
planted
behind
the
eyes
among
these
birds
which
were
about
the
size
of
a
fowl
the
female
was
uniformly
brown
while
the
male
was
gorgeous
in
his
red
plumage
decorated
with
white
spots
gideon
spilett
with
a
stone
cleverly
and
vigorously
thrown
killed
one
of
these
tragopans
on
which
pencroft
made
hungry
by
the
fresh
air
had
cast
greedy
eyes
after
leaving
the
region
of
bushes
the
party
assisted
by
resting
on
each
others
shoulders
climbed
for
about
a
hundred
feet
up
a
steep
acclivity
and
reached
a
level
place
with
very
few
trees
where
the
soil
appeared
volcanic
it
was
necessary
to
ascend
by
zigzags
to
make
the
slope
more
easy
for
it
was
very
steep
and
the
footing
being
exceedingly
precarious
required
the
greatest
caution
neb
and
herbert
took
the
lead
pencroft
the
rear
the
captain
and
the
reporter
between
them
the
animals
which
frequented
these
heightsand
there
were
numerous
traces
of

necessarily
belong
to
those
races
of
sure
foot
and
supple
spine
chamois
or
goat
several
were
seen
but
this
was
not
the
name
pencroft
gave
them
for
all
of
a
suddensheep
he
shouted
all
stopped
about
fifty
feet
from
halfadozen
animals
of
a
large
size
with
strong
horns
bent
back
and
flattened
towards
the
point
with
a
woolly
fleece
hidden
under
long
silky
hair
of
a
tawny
color
they
were
not
ordinary
sheep
but
a
species
usually
found
in
the
mountainous
regions
of
the
temperate
zone
to
which
herbert
gave
the
name
of
the
musmon
have
they
legs
and
chops
asked
the
sailor
yes
replied
herbert
well
then
they
are
sheep
said
pencroft
the
animals
motionless
among
the
blocks
of
basalt
gazed
with
an
astonished
eye
as
if
they
saw
human
bipeds
for
the
first
time
then
their
fears
suddenly
aroused
they
disappeared
bounding
over
the
rocks
goodbye
till
we
meet
again
cried
pencroft
as
he
watched
them
in
such
a
comical
tone
that
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
herbert
and
neb
could
not
help
laughing
the
ascent
was
continued
here
and
there
were
traces
of
lava
sulphur
springs
sometimes
stopped
their
way
and
they
had
to
go
round
them
in

formed

among
other
substances

of
an
infinity
of
little
feldspar

plateau
formed
by
the
truncating
of
the
lower
cone
the
difficulties
of
the
ascent
were
very
great
towards
four
oclock
the
extreme
zone
of
the
trees
had
been
passed
there
only
remained
here
and
there
a
few
twisted
stunted
pines
which
must
have
had
a
hard
life
in
resisting
at
this
altitude
the
high
winds
from
the
open
sea
happily
for
the
engineer
and
his
companions
the
weather
was
beautiful
the
atmosphere
tranquil
for
a
high
breeze
at
an
elevation
of
three
thousand
feet
would
have
hindered
their
proceedings
the
purity
of
the
sky
at
the
zenith
was
felt
through
the
transparent
air
a
perfect
calm
reigned
around
them
they
could
not
see
the
sun
then
hid
by
the
vast
screen
of
the
upper
cone
which
masked
the
halfhorizon
of
the
west
and
whose
enormous
shadow
stretching
to
the
shore
increased
as
the
radiant
luminary
sank
in
its
diurnal
course
vapormist
rather
than

to
appear
in

and

all
the
prismatic

under
the
influence
of
the
solar
rays
five
hundred
feet
only
separated
the
explorers
from
the
plateau
which
they
wished
to
reach
so
as
to
establish
there
an
encampment
for
the
night
but
these
five
hundred
feet
were
increased
to
more
than
two
miles
by
the
zigzags
which
they
had
to
describe
the
soil
as
it
were
slid
under
their
feet
the
slope
often
presented
such
an
angle
that
they
slipped
when
the
stones
worn
by
the
air
did
not
give
a
sufficient
support
evening
came
on
by
degrees
and
it
was
almost
night
when
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
much
fatigued
by
an
ascent
of
seven
hours
arrived
at
the
plateau
of
the
first
cone
it
was
then
necessary
to
prepare
an
encampment
and
to
restore
their
strength
by
eating
first
and
sleeping
afterwards
this
second
stage
of
the
mountain
rose
on
a
base
of
rocks
among
which
it
would
be
easy
to
find
a
retreat
fuel
was
not
abundant
however
a
fire
could
be
made
by
means
of
the
moss
and
dry
brushwood
which
covered
certain
parts
of
the
plateau
while
the
sailor
was
preparing
his
hearth
with
stones
which
he
put
to
this
use
neb
and
herbert
occupied
themselves
with
getting
a
supply
of
fuel
they
soon
returned
with
a
load
of
brushwood
the
steel
was
struck
the
burnt
linen
caught
the
sparks
of
flint
and
under
nebs
breath
a
crackling
fire
showed
itself
in
a
few
minutes
under
the
shelter
of
the
rocks
their
object
in
lighting
a
fire
was
only
to
enable
them
to
withstand
the
cold
temperature
of
the
night
as
it
was
not
employed
in
cooking
the
bird
which
neb
kept
for
the
next
day
the
remains
of
the
capybara
and
some
dozens
of
the
stonepine
almonds
formed
their
supper
it
was
not
halfpast
six
when
all
was
finished
cyrus
harding
then
thought
of
exploring
in
the
halflight
the
large
circular
layer
which
supported
the
upper
cone
of
the
mountain
before
taking
any
rest
he
wished
to
know
if
it
was
possible
to
get
round
the
base
of
the
cone
in
the
case
of
its
sides
being
too
steep
and
its
summit
being
inaccessible
this
question
preoccupied
him
for
it
was
possible
that
from
the
way
the
hat
inclined
that
is
to
say
towards
the
north
the
plateau
was
not
practicable
also
if
the
summit
of
the
mountain
could
not
be
reached
on
one
side
and
if
on
the
other
they
could
not
get
round
the
base
of
the
cone
it
would
be
impossible
to
survey
the
western
part
of
the
country
and
their
object
in
making
the
ascent
would
in
part
be
altogether
unattained
the
engineer
accordingly
regardless
of
fatigue
leaving
pencroft
and
neb
to
arrange
the
beds
and
gideon
spilett
to
note
the
incidents
of
the
day
began
to
follow
the
edge
of
the
plateau
going
towards
the
north
herbert
accompanied
him
the
night
was
beautiful
and
still
the
darkness
was
not
yet
deep
cyrus
harding
and
the
boy
walked
near
each
other
without
speaking
in
some
places
the
plateau
opened
before
them
and
they
passed
without
hindrance
in
others
obstructed
by
rocks
there
was
only
a
narrow
path
in
which
two
persons
could
not
walk
abreast
after
a
walk
of
twenty
minutes
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
were
obliged
to
stop
from
this
point
the
slope
of
the
two
cones
became
one
no
shoulder
here
separated
the
two
parts
of
the
mountain
the
slope
being
inclined
almost
seventy
degrees
the
path
became
impracticable
but
if
the
engineer
and
the
boy
were
obliged
to
give
up
thoughts
of
following
a
circular
direction
in
return
an
opportunity
was
given
for
ascending
the
cone
in
fact
before
them
opened
a
deep
hollow
it
was
the
rugged
mouth
of
the
crater
by
which
the
eruptive
liquid
matter
had
escaped
at
the
periods
when
the
volcano
was
still
in
activity
hardened
lava
and
crusted
scoria
formed
a
sort
of
natural
staircase
of
large
steps
which
would
greatly
facilitate
the
ascent
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
harding
took
all
this
in
at
a
glance
and
without
hesitating
followed
by
the
lad
he
entered
the
enormous
chasm
in
the
midst
of
an
increasing
obscurity
there
was
still
a
height
of
a
thousand
feet
to
overcome
would
the
interior
acclivities
of
the
crater
be
practicable
it
would
soon
be
seen
the
persevering
engineer
resolved
to
continue
his
ascent
until
he
was
stopped
happily
these
acclivities
wound
up
the
interior
of
the
volcano
and
favored
their
ascent
as
to
the
volcano
itself
it
could
not
be
doubted
that
it
was
completely
extinct
no
smoke
escaped
from
its
sides
not
a
flame
could
be
seen
in
the
dark
hollows
not
a
roar
not
a
mutter
no
trembling
even
issued
from
this
black
well
which
perhaps
reached
far
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
the
atmosphere
inside
the
crater
was
filled
with
no
sulphurous
vapor
it
was
more
than
the
sleep
of
a
volcano
it
was

complete

would
succeed
little
by
little
herbert
and
he
climbing
up
the
sides
of
the
interior
saw
the
crater
widen
above
their
heads
the
radius
of
this
circular
portion
of
the
sky
framed
by
the

obviously
at

as
it
were
that
the

made

entered
the
field
of
their
vision
the
magnificent
constellations
of
the
southern
sky
shone
resplendently
at
the
zenith
glittered
the
splendid
antares
in
the

and
not
far
was
alpha

which
is
believed
to
be
the
nearest

to
the

as

widened
appeared

the

lastly
nearly
at
the
antarctic
pole
the
glittering
southern
cross
which
replaces
the
polar
star
of
the
northern
hemisphere
it
was
nearly
eight
oclock
when
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
set
foot
on
the
highest
ridge
of
the
mountain
at
the
summit
of
the
cone
it
was
then
perfectly
dark
and
their
gaze
could
not
extend
over
a
radius
of
two
miles
did
the
sea
surround
this
unknown
land
or
was
it
connected
in
the
west
with
some
continent
of
the
pacific
it
could
not
yet
be
made
out
towards
the
west
a
cloudy
belt
clearly
visible
at
the
horizon
increased
the
gloom
and
the
eye
could
not
discover
if
the
sky
and
water
were
blended
together
in
the
same
circular
line
but
at
one
point
of
the
horizon
a
vague
light
suddenly
appeared
which
descended
slowly
in
proportion
as
the
cloud
mounted
to
the
zenith
it
was
the
slender
crescent
moon
already
almost
disappearing
but
its
light
was
sufficient
to
show
clearly
the
horizontal
line
then
detached
from
the
cloud
and
the
engineer
could
see
its
reflection
trembling
for
an
instant
on
a
liquid
surface
cyrus
harding
seized
the
lads
hand
and
in
a
grave
voice
an
island
said
he
at
the
moment
when
the
lunar
crescent
disappeared
beneath
the
waves

half
an
hour
later
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
had
returned
to
the
encampment
the
engineer
merely
told
his
companions
that
the
land
upon
which
fate
had
thrown
them
was
an
island
and
that
the
next
day
they
would
consult
then
each
settled
himself
as
well
as
he
could
to
sleep
and
in
that
rocky
hole
at
a
height
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
through
a
peaceful
night
the
islanders
enjoyed
profound
repose
the
next
day
the
30th
of
march
after
a
hasty
breakfast
which
consisted
solely
of
the
roasted
tragopan
the
engineer
wished
to
climb
again
to
the
summit
of
the
volcano
so
as
more
attentively
to
survey
the
island
upon
which
he
and
his
companions
were
imprisoned
for
life
perhaps
should
the
island
be
situated
at
a
great
distance
from
any
land
or
if
it
was
out
of
the
course
of
vessels
which
visited
the
archipelagoes
of
the
pacific
ocean
this
time
his
companions
followed
him
in
the
new
exploration
they
also
wished
to
see
the
island
on
the
productions
of
which
they
must
depend
for
the
supply
of
all
their
wants
it
was
about
seven
oclock
in
the
morning
when
cyrus
harding
herbert
pencroft
gideon
spilett
and
neb
quitted
the
encampment
no
one
appeared
to
be
anxious
about
their
situation
they
had
faith
in
themselves
doubtless
but
it
must
be
observed
that
the
basis
of
this
faith
was
not
the
same
with
harding
as
with
his
companions
the
engineer
had
confidence
because
he
felt
capable
of
extorting
from
this
wild
country
everything
necessary
for
the
life
of
himself
and
his
companions
the
latter
feared
nothing
just
because
cyrus
harding
was
with
them
pencroft
especially
since
the
incident
of
the
relighted
fire
would
not
have
despaired
for
an
instant
even
if
he
was
on

rock
if
the

was
with

we
left

it
will
be

if
we
dont
manage
to

certainly
no

cyrus
harding
followed
the
same
road
as
the
evening
before
they
went
round
the
cone
by
the
plateau
which
formed
the
shoulder
to
the
mouth
of
the
enormous
chasm
the
weather
was
magnificent
the
sun
rose
in
a
pure
sky
and
flooded
with
his
rays
all
the
eastern
side
of
the
mountain
the
crater
was
reached
it
was
just
what
the
engineer
had
made
it
out
to
be
in
the
dark
that
is
to
say
a
vast
funnel
which
extended
widening
to
a
height
of
a
thousand
feet
above
the
plateau
below
the
chasm
large
thick
streaks
of
lava
wound
over
the
sides
of
the
mountain
and
thus
marked
the
course
of
the
eruptive
matter
to
the
lower
valleys
which
furrowed
the
northern
part
of
the
island
the
interior
of
the
crater
whose
inclination
did
not
exceed
thirty
five
to
forty
degrees
presented
no
difficulties
nor
obstacles
to
the
ascent
traces
of
very
ancient
lava
were
noticed
which
probably
had
overflowed
the
summit
of
the
cone
before
this
lateral
chasm
had
opened
a
new
way
to
it
as
to
the
volcanic
chimney
which
established
a
communication
between
the
subterranean
layers
and
the
crater
its
depth
could
not
be
calculated
with
the
eye
for
it
was
lost
in
obscurity
but
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
complete
extinction
of
the
volcano
before
eight
oclock
harding
and
his
companions
were
assembled
at
the
summit
of
the
crater
on
a
conical
mound
which
swelled
the
northern
edge
the
sea
the
sea
everywhere
they
cried
as
if
their
lips
could
not
restrain
the
words
which
made
islanders
of
them
the
sea
indeed
formed
an
immense
circular
sheet
of
water
all
around
them
perhaps
on
climbing
again
to
the
summit
of
the
cone
cyrus
harding
had
had
a
hope
of
discovering
some
coast
some
island
shore
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
perceive
in
the
dark
the
evening
before
but
nothing
appeared
on
the
farthest
verge
of
the
horizon
that
is
to
say
over
a
radius
of
more
than
fifty
miles
no
land
in
sight
not
a
sail
over
all
this
immense
space
the
ocean
alone
was
visiblethe
island
occupied
the
center
of
a
circumference
which
appeared
to
be
infinite
the
engineer
and
his
companions
mute
and
motionless
surveyed
for
some
minutes
every
point
of
the
ocean
examining
it
to
its
most
extreme
limits
even
pencroft
who
possessed
a
marvelous
power
of
sight
saw
nothing
and
certainly
if
there
had
been
land
at
the
horizon
if
it
appeared
only
as
an
indistinct
vapor
the
sailor
would
undoubtedly
have
found
it
out
for
nature
had
placed
regular
telescopes
under
his
eyebrows
from
the
ocean
their
gaze
returned
to
the
island
which
they
commanded
entirely
and
the
first
question
was
put
by
gideon
spilett
in
these
terms
about
what
size
is
this
island
truly
it
did
not
appear
large
in
the
midst
of
the
immense
ocean
cyrus
harding
reflected
a
few
minutes
he
attentively
observed
the
perimeter
of
the
island
taking
into
consideration
the
height
at
which
he
was
placed
then
my
friends
said
he
i
do
not
think
i
am
mistaken
in
giving
to
the
shore
of
the
island
a
circumference
of
more
than
a
hundred
miles
and
consequently
an
area
that
is
difficult
to
estimate
replied
the
engineer
for
it
is
so
uneven
if
cyrus
harding
was
not
mistaken
in
his
calculation
the
island
had
almost
the
extent
of
malta
or
zante
in
the
mediterranean
but
it
was
at
the
same
time
much
more
irregular
and
less
rich
in
capes
promontories
points
bays
or
creeks
its
strange
form
caught
the
eye
and
when
gideon
spilett
on
the
engineers
advice
had
drawn
the
outline
they
found
that
it
resembled
some
fantastic
animal
a
monstrous
leviathan
which
lay
sleeping
on
the
surface
of
the
pacific
this
was
in
fact
the
exact
shape
of
the
island
which
it
is
of
consequence
to
know
and
a
tolerably
correct
map
of
it
was
immediately
drawn
by
the
reporter
the
east
part
of
the
shore
where
the
castaways
had
landed
formed
a
wide
bay
terminated
by
a
sharp
cape
which
had
been
concealed
by
a
high
point
from
pencroft
on
his
first
exploration
at
the
northeast
two
other
capes
closed
the
bay
and
between
them
ran
a
narrow
gulf
which
looked
like
the
halfopen
jaws
of
a
formidable
dogfish
from
the
northeast
to
the
southwest
the
coast
was
rounded
like
the
flattened
cranium
of
an
animal
rising
again
forming
a
sort
of
protuberance
which
did
not
give
any
particular
shape
to
this
part
of
the
island
of
which
the
center
was
occupied
by
the
volcano
from
this
point
the
shore
ran
pretty
regularly
north
and
south
broken
at
twothirds
of
its
perimeter
by
a
narrow
creek
from
which
it
ended
in
a
long
tail
similar
to
the
caudal
appendage
of
a
gigantic
alligator
this
tail
formed
a
regular
peninsula
which
stretched
more
than
thirty
miles
into
the
sea
reckoning
from
the
cape
southeast
of
the
island
already
mentioned
it
curled
round
making
an
open
roadstead
which
marked
out
the
lower
shore
of
this
strangelyformed
land
at
the
narrowest
part
that
is
to
say
between
the
chimneys
and
the
creek
on
the
western
shore
which
corresponded
to
it
in
latitude
the
island
only
measured
ten
miles
but
its
greatest
length
from
the
jaws
at
the
northeast
to
the
extremity
of
the
tail
of
the
southwest
was
not
less
than
thirty
miles
as
to
the
interior
of
the
island
its
general
aspect
was
this
very
woody
throughout
the
southern
part
from
the
mountain
to
the
shore
and
arid
and
sandy
in
the
northern
part
between
the
volcano
and
the
east
coast
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
were
surprised
to
see
a
lake
bordered
with
green
trees
the
existence
of
which
they
had
not
suspected
seen
from
this
height
the
lake
appeared
to
be
on
the
same
level
as
the
ocean
but
on
reflection
the
engineer
explained
to
his
companions
that
the
altitude
of
this
little
sheet
of
water
must
be
about
three
hundred
feet
because
the
plateau
which
was
its
basin
was
but
a
prolongation
of
the
coast
is
it
a
freshwater
lake
asked
pencroft
certainly
replied
the
engineer
for
it
must
be
fed
by
the
water
which
flows
from
the
mountain
i
see
a
little
river
which
runs
into
it
said
herbert
pointing
out
a
narrow
stream
which
evidently
took
its
source
somewhere
in
the
west
yes
said
harding
and
since
this
stream
feeds
the
lake
most
probably
on
the
side
near
the
sea
there
is
an
outlet
by
which
the
surplus
water
escapes
we
shall
see
that
on
our
return
this
little
winding
watercourse
and
the
river
already
mentioned
constituted
the
watersystem
at
least
such
as
it
was
displayed
to
the
eyes
of
the
explorers
however
it
was
possible
that
under
the
masses
of
trees
which
covered
twothirds
of
the
island
forming
an
immense
forest
other
rivers
ran
towards
the
sea
it
might
even
be
inferred
that
such
was
the
case
so
rich
did
this
region
appear
in
the
most
magnificent
specimens
of
the
flora
of
the
temperate
zones
there
was
no
indication
of
running
water
in
the
north
though
perhaps
there
might
be
stagnant
water
among
the
marshes
in
the
northeast
but
that
was
all
in
addition
to
the
downs
sand
and
aridity
which
contrasted
so
strongly
with
the
luxuriant
vegetation
of
the
rest
of
the
island
the
volcano
did
not
occupy
the
central
part
it
rose
on
the
contrary
in
the
northwestern
region
and
seemed
to
mark
the
boundary
of
the
two
zones
at
the
southwest
at
the
south
and
the
southeast
the
first
part
of
the
spurs
were
hidden
under
masses
of
verdure
at
the
north
on
the
contrary
one
could
follow
their
ramifications
which
died
away
on
the
sandy
plains
it
was
on
this
side
that
at
the
time
when
the
mountain
was
in
a
state
of
eruption
the
discharge
had
worn
away
a
passage
and
a
large
heap
of
lava
had
spread
to
the
narrow
jaw
which
formed
the
northeastern
gulf
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
remained
an
hour
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
the
island
was
displayed
under
their
eyes
like
a
plan
in
relief
with
different
tints
green
for
the
forests
yellow
for
the
sand
blue
for
the
water
they
viewed
it
in
its
toutensemble
nothing
remained
concealed
but
the
ground
hidden
by
verdure
the
hollows
of
the
valleys
and
the
interior
of
the
volcanic
chasms
one
important
question
remained
to
be
solved
and
the
answer
would
have
a
great
effect
upon
the
future
of
the
castaways
was
the
island
inhabited
it
was
the
reporter
who
put
this
question
to
which
after
the
close
examination
they
had
just
made
the
answer
seemed
to
be
in
the
negative
nowhere
could
the
work
of
a
human
hand
be
perceived
not
a
group
of
huts
not
a
solitary
cabin
not
a
fishery
on
the
shore
no
smoke
curling
in
the
air
betrayed
the
presence
of
man
it
is
true
a
distance
of
nearly
thirty
miles
separated
the
observers
from
the
extreme
points
that
is
of
the
tail
which
extended
to
the
southwest
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
even
to
pencrofts
eyes
to
discover
a
habitation
there
neither
could
the
curtain
of
verdure
which
covered
threequarters
of
the
island
be
raised
to
see
if
it
did
not
shelter
some
straggling
village
but
in
general
the
islanders
live
on
the
shores
of
the
narrow
spaces
which
emerge
above
the
waters
of
the
pacific
and
this
shore
appeared
to
be
an
absolute
desert
until
a
more
complete
exploration
it
might
be
admitted
that
the
island
was
uninhabited
but
was
it
frequented
at
least
occasionally
by
the
natives
of
neighboring
islands
it
was
difficult
to
reply
to
this
question
no
land
appeared
within
a
radius
of
fifty
miles
but
fifty
miles
could
be
easily
crossed
either
by
malay
proas
or
by
the
large
polynesian
canoes
everything
depended
on
the
position
of
the
island
of
its
isolation
in
the
pacific
or
of
its
proximity
to
archipelagoes
would
cyrus
harding
be
able
to
find
out
their
latitude
and
longitude
without
instruments
it
would
be
difficult
since
he
was
in
doubt
it
was
best
to
take
precautions
against
a
possible
descent
of
neighboring
natives
the
exploration
of
the
island
was
finished
its
shape
determined
its
features
made
out
its
extent
calculated
the
water
and
mountain
systems
ascertained
the
disposition
of
the
forests
and
plains
had
been
marked
in
a
general
way
on
the
reporters
plan
they
had
now
only
to
descend
the
mountain
slopes
again
and
explore
the
soil
in
the
triple
point
of
view
of
its
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
resources
but
before
giving
his
companions
the
signal
for
departure
cyrus
harding
said
to
them
in
a
calm
grave
voice
here
my
friends
is
the
small
corner
of
land
upon
which
the
hand
of
the
almighty
has
thrown
us
we
are
going
to
live
here
a
long
time
perhaps
perhaps
too
unexpected
help
will
arrive
if
some
ship
passes
by
chance
i
say
by
chance
because
this
is
an
unimportant
island
there
is
not
even
a
port
in
which
ships
could
anchor
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
it
is
situated
out
of
the
route
usually
followed
that
is
to
say
too
much
to
the
south
for
the
ships
which
frequent
the
archipelagoes
of
the
pacific
and
too
much
to
the
north
for
those
which
go
to
australia
by
doubling
cape
horn
i
wish
to
hide
nothing
of
our
position
from
you
and
you
are
right
my
dear
cyrus
replied
the
reporter
with
animation
you
have
to
deal
with
men
they
have
confidence
in
you
and
you
can
depend
upon
them
is
it
not
so
my
friends
i
will
obey
you
in
everything
captain
said
herbert
seizing
the
engineers
hand
my
master
always
and
everywhere
cried
neb
as
for
me
said
the
sailor
if
i
ever
grumble
at
work
my
names
not
jack
pencroft
and
if
you
like
captain
we
will
make
a
little
america
of
this
island
we
will
build
towns
we
will
establish
railways
start
telegraphs
and
one
fine
day
when
it
is
quite
changed
quite
put
in
order
and
quite
civilized
we
will
go
and
offer
it
to
the
government
of
the
union
only
i
ask
one
thing
what
is
that
said
the
reporter
it
is
that
we
do
not
consider
ourselves
castaways
but
colonists
who
have
come
here
to
settle
harding
could
not
help
smiling
and
the
sailors
idea
was
adopted
he
then
thanked
his
companions
and
added
that
he
would
rely
on
their
energy
and
on
the
aid
of
heaven
well
now
let
us
set
off
to
the
chimneys
cried
pencroft
one
minute
my
friends
said
the
engineer
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
give
a
name
to
this
island
as
well
as
to
the
capes
promontories
and
watercourses
which
we
can
see
very
good
said
the
reporter
in
the
future
that
will
simplify
the
instructions
which
we
shall
have
to
give
and
follow
indeed
said
the
sailor
already
it
is
something
to
be
able
to
say
where
one
is
going
and
where
one
has
come
from
at
least
it
looks
like
somewhere
the
chimneys
for
example
said
herbert
exactly
replied
pencroft
that
name
was
the
most
convenient
and
it
came
to
me
quite
of
myself
shall
we
keep
the
name
of
the
chimneys
for
our
first
encampment
captain
yes
pencroft
since
you
have
so
christened
it
good
as
for
the
others
that
will
be
easy
returned
the
sailor
who
was
in
high
spirits
let
us
give
them
names
as
the
robinsons
did
whose
story
herbert
has
often
read

gideon
i
should
prefer
borrowing
names
from

country
said
the
reporter
which
would
remind
us
of
america
yes
for
the
principal
ones
then
said
cyrus
harding
for
those
of
the
bays
and
seas
i
admit
it
willingly
we
might
give
to
that
vast
bay
on
the
east
the
name
of
union
bay
for
example
to
that
large
hollow
on
the
south
washington
bay
to
the
mountain
upon
which
we
are
standing
that
of
mount
franklin
to
that
lake
which
is
extended
under
our
eyes
that
of
lake
grant
nothing
could
be
better
my
friends
these
names
will
recall
our
country
and
those
of
the
great
citizens
who
have
honored
it
but
for
the
rivers
gulfs
capes
and
promontories
which
we
perceive
from
the
top
of
this
mountain
rather
let
us
choose
names
which
will
recall
their
particular
shape
they
will
impress
themselves
better
on
our
memory
and
at
the
same
time
will
be
more
practical
the
shape
of
the
island
is
so
strange
that
we
shall
not
be
troubled
to
imagine
what
it
resembles
as
to
the
streams
which
we
do
not
know
as
yet
in
different
parts
of
the
forest
which
we
shall
explore
later
the
creeks
which
afterwards
will
be
discovered
we
can
christen
them
as
we
find
them
what
do
you
think
my
friends
the
engineers
proposal
was
unanimously
agreed
to
by
his
companions
the
island
was
spread
out
under
their
eyes
like
a
map
and
they
had
only
to
give
names
to
all
its
angles
and
points
gideon
spilett
would
write
them
down
and
the
geographical
nomenclature
of
the
island
would
be
definitely
adopted
first
they
named
the
two
bays
and
the
mountain
union
bay
washington
bay
and
mount
franklin
as
the
engineer
had
suggested
now
said
the
reporter
to
this
peninsula
at
the
southwest
of
the
island
i
propose
to
give
the
name
of
serpentine
peninsula
and
that
of
reptileend
to
the
bent
tail
which
terminates
it
for
it
is
just
like
a
reptiles
tail
adopted
said
the
engineer
now
said
herbert
pointing
to
the
other
extremity
of
the
island
let
us
call
this
gulf
which
is
so
singularly
like
a
pair
of
open
jaws
shark
gulf
capital
cried
pencroft
and
we
can
complete
the
resemblance
by
naming
the
two
parts
of
the
jaws
mandible
cape
but
there
are
two
capes
observed
the
reporter
well
replied
pencroft
we
can
have
north
mandible
cape
and
south
mandible
cape
they
are
inscribed
said
spilett
there
is
only
the
point
at
the
southeastern
extremity
of
the
island
to
be
named
said
pencroft
that
is
the
extremity
of
union
bay
asked
herbert
claw
cape
cried
neb
directly
who
also
wished
to
be
godfather
to
some
part
of
his
domain
in
truth
neb
had
found
an
excellent
name
for
this
cape
was
very
like
the
powerful
claw
of
the
fantastic
animal
which
this
singularlyshaped
island
represented
pencroft
was
delighted
at
the
turn
things
had
taken
and
their
imaginations
soon
gave
to
the
river
which
furnished
the
settlers
with
drinking
water
and
near
which
the
balloon
had
thrown
them
the
name
of
the
mercy
in
true
gratitude
to
providence
to
the
islet
upon
which
the
castaways
had
first
landed
the
name
of
safety
island
to
the
plateau
which
crowned
the
high
granite
precipice
above
the
chimneys
and
from
whence
the
gaze
could
embrace
the
whole
of
the
vast
bay
the
name
of
prospect
heights
lastly
all
the
masses
of
impenetrable
wood
which
covered
the
serpentine
peninsula
were
named
the
forests
of
the
far
west
the
nomenclature
of
the
visible
and
known
parts
of
the
island
was
thus
finished
and
later
they
would
complete
it
as
they
made
fresh
discoveries
as
to
the
points
of
the
compass
the
engineer
had
roughly
fixed
them
by
the
height
and
position
of
the
sun
which
placed
union
bay
and
prospect
heights
to
the
east
but
the
next
day
by
taking
the
exact
hour
of
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
and
by
marking
its
position
between
this
rising
and
setting
he
reckoned
to
fix
the
north
of
the
island
exactly
for
in
consequence
of
its
situation
in
the
southern
hemisphere
the
sun
at
the
precise
moment
of
its
culmination
passed
in
the
north
and
not
in
the
south
as
in
its
apparent
movement
it
seems
to
do
to
those
places
situated
in
the
northern
hemisphere
everything
was
finished
and
the
settlers
had
only
to
descend
mount
franklin
to
return
to
the
chimneys
when
pencroft
cried
out
well
we
are
preciously
stupid
why
asked
gideon
spilett
who
had
closed
his
notebook
and
risen
to
depart
why
our
island
we
have
forgotten
to
christen
it
herbert
was
going
to
propose
to
give
it
the
engineers
name
and
all
his
companions
would
have
applauded
him
when
cyrus
harding
said
simply
let
us
give
it
the
name
of
a
great
citizen
my
friend
of
him
who
now
struggles
to
defend
the
unity
of
the
american
republic
let
us
call
it
lincoln
island
the
engineers
proposal
was
replied
to
by
three
hurrahs
and
that
evening
before
sleeping
the
new
colonists
talked
of
their
absent
country
they
spoke
of
the
terrible
war
which
stained
it
with
blood
they
could
not
doubt
that
the
south
would
soon
be
subdued
and
that
the
cause
of
the
north
the
cause
of
justice
would
triumph
thanks
to
grant
thanks
to
lincoln
now
this
happened
the
30th
of
march
1865
they
little
knew
that
sixteen
days
afterwards
a
frightful
crime
would
be
committed
in
washington
and
that
on
good
friday
abraham
lincoln
would
fall
by
the
hand
of
a
fanatic
chapter
12
they
now
began
the
descent
of
the
mountain
climbing
down
the
crater
they
went
round
the
cone
and
reached
their
encampment
of
the
previous
night
pencroft
thought
it
must
be
breakfasttime
and
the
watches
of
the
reporter
and
engineer
were
therefore
consulted
to
find
out
the
hour
that
of
gideon
spilett
had
been
preserved
from
the
seawater
as
he
had
been
thrown
at
once
on
the
sand
out
of
reach
of
the
waves
it
was
an
instrument
of
excellent
quality
a
perfect
pocket
chronometer
which
the
reporter
had
not
forgotten
to
wind
up
carefully
every
day
as
to
the
engineers
watch
it
of
course
had
stopped
during
the
time
which
he
had
passed
on
the
downs
the
engineer
now
wound
it
up
and
ascertaining
by
the
height
of
the
sun
that
it
must
be
about
nine
oclock
in
the
morning
he
put
his
watch
at
that
hour
no
my
dear
spilett
wait
you
have
kept
the
richmond
time
have
you
not
yes
cyrus
consequently
your
watch
is
set
by
the
meridian
of
that
town
which
is
almost
that
of
washington
undoubtedly
very
well
keep
it
thus
content
yourself
with
winding
it
up
very
exactly
but
do
not
touch
the
hands
this
may
be
of
use
to
us
what
will
be
the
good
of
that
thought
the
sailor
they
ate
and
so
heartily
that
the
store
of
game
and
almonds
was
totally
exhausted
but
pencroft
was
not
at
all
uneasy
they
would
supply
themselves
on
the
way
top
whose
share
had
been
very
much
to
his
taste
would
know
how
to
find
some
fresh
game
among
the
brushwood
moreover
the
sailor
thought
of
simply
asking
the
engineer
to
manufacture
some
powder
and
one
or
two
fowlingpieces
he
supposed
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
that
on
leaving
the
plateau
the
captain
proposed
to
his
companions
to
return
to
the
chimneys
by
a
new
way
he
wished
to
reconnoiter
lake
grant
so
magnificently
framed
in
trees
they
therefore
followed
the
crest
of
one
of
the
spurs
between
which
the
creek
that
supplied
the
lake
probably
had
its
source
in
talking
the
settlers
already
employed
the
names
which
they
had
just
chosen
which
singularly
facilitated
the
exchange
of
their
ideas
herbert
and
pencroftthe
one
young
and
the
other
very
boyishwere
enchanted
and
while
walking
the
sailor
said
hey
herbert
how
capital
it
sounds
it
will
be
impossible
to
lose
ourselves
my
boy
since
whether
we
follow
the
way
to
lake
grant
or
whether
we
join
the
mercy
through
the
woods
of
the
far
west
we
shall
be
certain
to
arrive
at
prospect
heights
and
consequently
at
union
bay
it
had
been
agreed
that
without
forming
a
compact
band
the
settlers
should
not
stray
away
from
each
other
it
was
very
certain
that
the
thick
forests
of
the
island
were
inhabited
by
dangerous
animals
and
it
was
prudent
to
be
on
their
guard
in
general
pencroft
herbert
and
neb
walked
first
preceded
by
top
who
poked
his
nose
into
every
bush
the
reporter
and
the
engineer
went
together
gideon
spilett
ready
to
note
every
incident
the
engineer
silent
for
the
most
part
and
only
stepping
aside
to
pick
up
one
thing
or
another
a
mineral
or
vegetable
substance
which
he
put
into
his
pocket
without
making
any
remark
what
can
he
be
picking
up
muttered
pencroft
i
have
looked
in
vain
for
anything
thats
worth
the
trouble
of
stooping
for
towards
ten
oclock
the
little
band
descended
the
last
declivities
of
mount
franklin
as
yet
the
ground
was
scantily
strewn
with
bushes
and
trees
they
were
walking
over
yellowish
calcinated
earth
forming
a
plain
of
nearly
a
mile
long
which
extended
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
great
blocks
of
that
basalt
which
according
to
bischof
takes
three
hundred
and
fifty
millions
of
years
to
cool
strewed
the
plain
very
confused
in
some
places
however
there
were
here
no
traces
of
lava
which
was
spread
more
particularly
over
the
northern
slopes
cyrus
harding
expected
to
reach
without
incident
the
course
of
the
creek
which
he
supposed
flowed
under
the
trees
at
the
border
of
the
plain
when
he
saw
herbert
running
hastily
back
while
neb
and
the
sailor
were
hiding
behind
the
rocks
whats
the
matter
my
boy
asked
spilett
smoke
replied
herbert
we
have
seen
smoke
among
the
rocks
a
hundred
paces
from
us
men
in
this
place
cried
the
reporter
we
must
avoid
showing
ourselves
before
knowing
with
whom
we
have
to
deal
replied
cyrus
harding
i
trust
that
there
are
no
natives
on
this
island
i
dread
them
more
than
anything
else
where
is
top
top
is
on
before
and
he
doesnt
bark
no
that
is
strange
however
we
must
try
to
call
him
back
in
a
few
moments
the
engineer
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
had
rejoined
their
two
companions
and
like
them
they
kept
out
of
sight
behind
the
heaps
of
basalt
from
thence
they
clearly
saw
smoke
of
a
yellowish
color
rising
in
the
air
top
was
recalled
by
a
slight
whistle
from
his
master
and
the
latter
signing
to
his
companions
to
wait
for
him
glided
away
among
the
rocks
the
colonists
motionless
anxiously
awaited
the
result
of
this
exploration
when
a
shout
from
the
engineer
made
them
hasten
forward
they
soon
joined
him
and
were
at
once
struck
with
a
disagreeable
odor
which
impregnated
the
atmosphere
the
odor
easily
recognized
was
enough
for
the
engineer
to
guess
what
the
smoke
was
which
at
first
not
without
cause
had
startled
him
this
fire
said
he
or
rather
this
smoke
is
produced
by
nature
alone
there
is
a
sulphur
spring
there
which
will
cure
all
our
sore
throats
captain
cried
pencroft
what
a
pity
that
i
havent
got
a
cold
the
settlers
then
directed
their
steps
towards
the
place
from
which
the
smoke
escaped
they
there
saw
a
sulphur
spring
which
flowed
abundantly
between
the
rocks
and
its
waters
discharged
a
strong
sulphuric
acid
odor
after
having
absorbed
the
oxygen
of
the
air
cyrus
harding
dipping
in
his
hand
felt
the
water
oily
to
the
touch
he
tasted
it
and
found
it
rather
sweet
as
to
its
temperature
that
he
estimated
at
ninetyfive
degrees
fahrenheit
herbert
having
asked
on
what
he
based
this
calculation
its
quite
simple
my
boy
said
he
for
in
plunging
my
hand
into
the
water
i
felt
no
sensation
either
of
heat
or
cold
therefore
it
has
the
same
temperature
as
the
human
body
which
is
about
ninetyfive
degrees
the
sulphur
spring
not
being
of
any
actual
use
to
the
settlers
they
proceeded
towards
the
thick
border
of
the
forest
which
began
some
hundred
paces
off
there
as
they
had
conjectured
the
waters
of
the
stream
flowed
clear
and
limpid
between
high
banks
of
red
earth
the
color
of
which
betrayed
the
presence

its

varying
from

waters
were
sweet

it
was
supposed
that
those
of

were
so
also
a
fortunate
circumstance
in
the
event
of
their
finding
on
its
borders
a
more
suitable
dwelling
than
the

to
the

some
hundred
feet
downwards
shaded
the

the

consisted
principally
of
casuarinas

but
the
cocoanut
so
abundant
in
the

seemed
to
be
wanting
in

to
the
birds
they
swarmed
among
the
scanty
branches
of
the
eucalypti
and
casuarinas
which
did
not
hinder
the
display
of
their

kingfishers
of
a
sparkling
green
and
crowned
with
red
blue
lories
and
various
other
birds
appeared
on
all
sides
as
through
a
prism
fluttering
about
and
producing
a
deafening
clamor
suddenly
a
strange
concert
of
discordant
voices
resounded
in
the
midst
of
a
thicket
the
settlers
heard
successively
the
song
of
birds
the
cry
of
quadrupeds
and
a
sort
of
clacking
which
they
might
have
believed
to
have
escaped
from
the
lips
of
a
native
neb
and
herbert
rushed
towards
the
bush
forgetting
even
the
most
elementary
principles
of
prudence
happily
they
found
there
neither
a
formidable
wild
beast
nor
a
dangerous
native
but
merely
half
a
dozen
mocking
and
singing
birds
known
as
mountain
pheasants
a
few
skillful
blows
from
a
stick
soon
put
an
end
to
their
concert
and
procured
excellent
food
for
the
evenings
dinner
herbert
also
discovered
some
magnificent
pigeons
with
bronzed
wings
some
superbly
crested
others
draped
in
green
like
their
congeners
at
portmacquarie
but
it
was
impossible
to
reach
them
or
the
crows
and
magpies
which
flew
away
in
flocks
a
charge
of
small
shot
would
have
made
great
slaughter
among
these
birds
but
the
hunters
were
still
limited
to
sticks
and
stones
and
these
primitive
weapons
proved
very
insufficient
their
insufficiency
was
still
more
clearly
shown
when
a
troop
of
quadrupeds
jumping
bounding
making
leaps
of
thirty
feet
regular
flying
mammiferae
fled
over
the
thickets
so
quickly
and
at
such
a
height
that
one
would
have
thought
that
they
passed
from
one
tree
to
another
like
squirrels
kangaroos
cried
herbert
are
they
good
to
eat
asked
pencroft
stewed
replied
the
reporter
their
flesh
is
equal
to
the
best
venison
gideon
spilett
had
not
finished
this
exciting
sentence
when
the
sailor
followed
by
neb
and
herbert
darted
on
the
kangaroos
tracks
cyrus
harding
called
them
back
in
vain
but
it
was
in
vain
too
for
the
hunters
to
pursue
such
agile
game
which
went
bounding
away
like
balls
after
a
chase
of
five
minutes
they
lost
their
breath
and
at
the
same
time
all
sight
of
the
creatures
which
disappeared
in
the
wood
top
was
not
more
successful
than
his
masters
captain
said
pencroft
when
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
had
rejoined
them
captain
you
see
quite
well
we
cant
get
on
unless
we
make
a
few
guns
will
that
be
possible
perhaps
replied
the
engineer
but
we
will
begin
by
first
manufacturing
some
bows
and
arrows
and
i
dont
doubt
that
you
will
become
as
clever
in
the
use
of
them
as
the
australian
hunters
bows
and
arrows
said
pencroft
scornfully
thats
all
very
well
for
children
dont
be
proud
friend
pencroft
replied
the
reporter
bows
and
arrows
were
sufficient
for
centuries
to
stain
the
earth
with
blood
powder
is
but
a
thing
of
yesterday
and
war
is
as
old
as
the
human
raceunhappily
faith
thats
true
mr
spilett
replied
the
sailor
and
i
always
speak
too
quickly
you
must
excuse
me
meanwhile
herbert
constant
to
his
favorite
science
natural
history
reverted
to
the
kangaroos
saying
besides
we
had
to
deal
just
now
with
the
species
which
is
most
difficult
to
catch
they
were
giants
with
long
gray
fur
but
if
i
am
not
mistaken
there
exist
black
and
red
kangaroos
rock
kangaroos
and
rat
kangaroos
which
are
more
easy
to
get
hold
of
it
is
reckoned
that
there
are
about
a
dozen
species
herbert
replied
the
sailor
sententiously
there
is
only
one
species
of
kangaroos
to
me
that
is
kangaroo
on
the
spit
and
its
just
the
one
we
havent
got
this
evening
they
could
not
help
laughing
at
master
pencrofts
new
classification
the
honest
sailor
did
not
hide
his
regret
at
being
reduced
for
dinner
to
the
singing
pheasants
but
fortune
once
more
showed
itself
obliging
to
him
in
fact
top
who
felt
that
his
interest
was
concerned
went
and
ferreted
everywhere
with
an
instinct
doubled
by
a
ferocious
appetite
it
was
even
probable
that
if
some
piece
of
game
did
fall
into
his
clutches
none
would
be
left
for
the
hunters
if
top
was
hunting
on
his
own
account
but
neb
watched
him
and
he
did
well
towards
three
oclock
the
dog
disappeared
in
the
brushwood
and
gruntings
showed
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
some
animal
neb
rushed
after
him
and
soon
saw
top
eagerly
devouring
a
quadruped
which
ten
seconds
later
would
have
been
past
recognizing
in
tops
stomach
but
fortunately
the
dog
had
fallen
upon
a
brood
and
besides
the
victim
he
was
devouring
two
other

strangled
on
the

neb
reappeared
triumphantly
holding
one
of
the
rodents
in
each
hand
their
size
exceeded
that
of
a
rabbit
their
hair
was
yellow
mingled
with
green
spots
and
they
had
the
merest
rudiments
of
tails
the
citizens
of
the
union
were
at
no
loss
for
the
right
name
of
these
rodents
they
were
maras
a
sort
of
agouti
a

pencroft
the

now
we
can

the

interrupted
for
an

resumed
the
limpid

bent
over
the

which
could
be
heard
murmuring
beneath
the
bowers
of
verdure
meanwhile
the
stream
grew
much
wider
and
cyrus
harding
supposed
that
they
would
soon
reach
its
mouth
in
fact
on
emerging
from
beneath
a
thick
clump
of
beautiful
trees
it
suddenly
appeared
before
their
eyes
the
explorers
had
arrived
on
the
western
shore
of
lake
grant
the
place
was
well
worth
looking
at
this
extent
of
water
of
a
circumference
of
nearly
seven
miles
and
an
area
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
acres
reposed
in
a
border
of
diversified
trees
towards
the
east
through
a
curtain
of
verdure
picturesquely
raised
in
some
places
sparkled
an
horizon
of
sea
the
lake
was
curved
at
the
north
which
contrasted
with
the
sharp
outline
of
its
lower
part
numerous
aquatic
birds
frequented
the
shores
of
this
little
ontario
in
which
the
thousand
isles
of
its
american
namesake
were
represented
by
a
rock
which
emerged
from
its
surface
some
hundred
feet
from
the
southern
shore
there
lived
in
harmony
several
couples
of
kingfishers
perched
on
a
stone
grave
motionless
watching
for
fish
then
darting
down
they
plunged
in
with
a
sharp
cry
and
reappeared
with
their
prey
in
their
beaks
on
the
shores
and
on
the
islets
strutted
wild
ducks

waterhens
redbeaks
philedons
furnished
with
a
tongue
like
a
brush
and
one
or
two
specimens
of
the
splendid
menura
the
tail
of
which
expands
gracefully
like
a
lyre
as
to
the
water
of
the
lake
it
was
sweet
limpid
rather
dark
and
from
certain
bubblings
and
the
concentric
circles
which
crossed
each
other
on
the
surface
it
could
not
be
doubted
that
it
abounded
in
fish
this
lake
is
really
beautiful
said
gideon
spilett
we
could
live
on
its
borders
we
will
live
there
replied
harding
the
settlers
wishing
to
return
to
the
chimneys
by
the
shortest
way
descended
towards
the
angle
formed
on
the
south
by
the
junction
of
the
lakes
bank
it
was
not
without
difficulty
that
they
broke
a
path
through
the
thickets
and
brushwood
which
had
never
been
put
aside
by
the
hand
of
men
and
they
thus
went
towards
the
shore
so
as
to
arrive
at
the
north
of
prospect
heights
two
miles
were
cleared
in
this
direction
and
then
after
they
had
passed
the
last
curtain
of
trees
appeared
the
plateau
carpeted
with
thick
turf
and
beyond
that
the
infinite
sea
to
return
to
the
chimneys
it
was
enough
to
cross
the
plateau
obliquely
for
the
space
of
a
mile
and
then
to
descend
to
the
elbow
formed
by
the
first
detour
of
the
mercy
but
the
engineer
desired
to
know
how
and
where
the
overplus
of
the
water
from
the
lake
escaped
and
the
exploration
was
prolonged
under
the
trees
for
a
mile
and
a
half
towards
the
north
it
was
most
probable
that
an
overfall
existed
somewhere
and
doubtless
through
a
cleft
in
the
granite
this
lake
was
only
in
short
an
immense
center
basin
which
was
filled
by
degrees
by
the
creek
and
its
waters
must
necessarily
pass
to
the
sea
by
some
fall
if
it
was
so
the
engineer
thought
that
it
might
perhaps
be
possible
to
utilize
this
fall
and
borrow
its
power
actually
lost
without
profit
to
any
one
they
continued
then
to
follow
the
shores
of
lake
grant
by
climbing
the
plateau
but
after
having
gone
a
mile
in
this
direction
cyrus
harding
had
not
been
able
to
discover
the
overfall
which
however
must
exist
somewhere
it
was
then
halfpast
four
in
order
to
prepare
for
dinner
it
was
necessary
that
the
settlers
should
return
to
their
dwelling
the
little
band
retraced
their
steps
therefore
and
by
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
arrived
at
the
chimneys
the
fire
was
lighted
and
neb
and
pencroft
on
whom
the
functions
of

naturally
devolved
to
the

in
his
quality

to
the

in
that
of

quickly
prepared
some
broiled
agouti
to
which
they
did
great
justice
the
repast
at
length
terminated
at
the
moment
when
each
one
was
about
to
give
himself
up
to
sleep
cyrus
harding
drew
from
his
pocket
little
specimens
of
different
sorts
of
minerals
and
just
said
my
friends
this

well
captain
where
are
we
going
to
begin
asked
pencroft
next
morning
of
the
engineer
at
the
beginning
replied
cyrus
harding
and
in
fact
the
settlers
were
compelled
to
begin
at
the
very
beginning
they
did
not
possess
even
the
tools
necessary
for
making
tools
and
they
were
not
even
in
the
condition
of
nature
who
having
time
husbands
her
strength
they
had
no
time
since
they
had
to
provide
for
the
immediate
wants
of
their
existence
and
though
profiting
by
acquired
experience
they
had
nothing
to
invent
still
they
had
everything
to
make
their
iron
and
their
steel
were
as
yet
only
in
the
state
of
minerals
their
earthenware
in
the
state
of
clay
their
linen
and
their
clothes
in
the
state
of
textile
material
it
must
be
said
however
that
the
settlers
were
men
in
the
complete
and
higher
sense
of
the
word
the
engineer
harding
could
not
have
been
seconded
by
more
intelligent
companions
nor
with
more
devotion
and
zeal
he
had
tried
them
he
knew
their
abilities
gideon
spilett
a
talented
reporter
having
learned
everything
so
as
to
be
able
to
speak
of
everything
would
contribute
largely
with
his
head
and
hands
to
the
colonization
of
the
island
he
would
not
draw
back
from
any
task
a
determined
sportsman
he
would
make
a
business
of
what
till
then
had
only
been
a
pleasure
to
him
herbert
a
gallant
boy
already
remarkably
well
informed
in
the
natural
sciences
would
render
greater
service
to
the
common
cause
neb
was
devotion
personified
clever
intelligent
indefatigable
robust
with
iron
health
he
knew
a
little
about
the
work
of
the
forge
and
could
not
fail
to
be
very
useful
in
the
colony
as
to
pencroft
he
had
sailed
over
every
sea
a
carpenter
in
the
dockyards
in
brooklyn
assistant
tailor
in
the
vessels
of
the
state
gardener
cultivator
during
his
holidays
etc
and
like
all
seamen
fit
for
anything
he
knew
how
to
do
everything
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
unite
five
men
better
fitted
to
struggle
against
fate
more
certain
to
triumph
over
it
at
the
beginning
cyrus
harding
had
said
now
this
beginning
of
which
the
engineer
spoke
was
the
construction
of
an
apparatus
which
would
serve
to
transform
the
natural
substances
the
part
which
heat
plays
in
these
transformations
is
known
now
fuel
wood
or
coal
was
ready
for
immediate
use
an
oven
must
be
built
to
use
it
what
is
this
oven
for
asked
pencroft
to
make
the
pottery
which
we
have
need
of
replied
harding
and
of
what
shall
we
make
the
oven
with
bricks
and
the
bricks
with
clay
let
us
start
my
friends
to
save
trouble
we
will
establish
our
manufactory
at
the
place
of
production
neb
will
bring
provisions
and
there
will
be
no
lack
of
fire
to
cook
the
food
no
replied
the
reporter
but
if
there
is
a
lack
of
food
for
want
of
instruments
for
the
chase
ah
if
we
only
had
a
knife
cried
the
sailor
well
asked
cyrus
harding
well
i
would
soon
make
a
bow
and
arrows
and
then
there
could
be
plenty
of
game
in
the
larder
yes
a
knife
a
sharp
blade
said
the
engineer
as
if
he
was
speaking
to
himself
at
this
moment
his
eyes
fell
upon
top
who
was
running
about
on
the
shore
suddenly
hardings
face
became
animated
top
here
said
he
the
dog
came
at
his
masters
call
the
latter
took
tops
head
between
his
hands
and
unfastening
the
collar
which
the
animal
wore
round
his
neck
he
broke
it
in
two
saying
there
are
two
knives
pencroft
two
hurrahs
from
the
sailor
was
the
reply
tops
collar
was
made
of
a
thin
piece
of
tempered
steel
they
had
only
to
sharpen
it
on
a
piece
of
sandstone
then
to
raise
the
edge
on
a
finer
stone
now
sandstone
was
abundant
on
the
beach
and
two
hours
after
the
stock
of
tools
in
the
colony
consisted
of
two
sharp
blades
which
were
easily
fixed
in
solid
handles
the
production
of
these
their
first
tools
was
hailed
as
a
triumph
it
was
indeed
a
valuable
result
of
their
labor
and
a
very
opportune
one
they
set
out
cyrus
harding
proposed
that
they
should
return
to
the
western
shore
of
the
lake
where
the
day
before
he
had
noticed
the
clayey
ground
of
which
he
possessed
a
specimen
they
therefore
followed
the
bank
of
the
mercy
traversed
prospect
heights
and
after
a
walk
of
five
miles
or
more
they
reached
a
glade
situated
two
hundred
feet
from
lake
grant
on
the
way
herbert
had
discovered
a
tree
the
branches
of
which
the
indians
of
south
america
employ
for
making
their
bows
it
was
the
crejimba
of
the
palm
family
which
does
not
bear
edible
fruit
long
straight
branches
were
cut
the
leaves
stripped
off
it
was
shaped
stronger
in
the
middle
more
slender
at
the
extremities
and
nothing
remained
to
be
done
but
to
find
a
plant
fit
to
make
the
bowstring
this
was
the
hibiscus
heterophyllus
which
furnishes
fibers
of
such
remarkable
tenacity
that
they
have
been
compared
to
the
tendons
of
animals
pencroft
thus
obtained
bows
of
tolerable
strength
for
which
he
only
wanted
arrows
these
were
easily
made
with
straight
stiff
branches
without
knots
but
the
points
with
which
they
must
be
armed
that
is
to
say
a
substance
to
serve
in
lieu
of
iron
could
not
be
met
with
so
easily
but
pencroft
said
that
having
done
his
part
of
the
work
chance
would
do
the
rest
the
settlers
arrived
on
the
ground
which
had
been
discovered
the
day
before
being
composed
of
the
sort
of
clay
which
is
used
for
making
bricks
and
tiles
it
was
very
useful
for
the
work
in
question
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
it
it
was
enough
to
scour
the
clay
with
sand
then
to
mold
the
bricks
and
bake
them
by
the
heat
of
a
wood
fire
generally
bricks
are
formed
in
molds
but
the
engineer
contented
himself
with
making
them
by
hand
all
that
day
and
the
day
following
were
employed
in
this
work
the
clay
soaked
in
water
was
mixed
by
the
feet
and
hands
of
the
manipulators
and
then
divided
into
pieces
of
equal
size
a
practiced
workman
can
make
without
a
machine
about
ten
thousand
bricks
in
twelve
hours
but
in
their
two
days
work
the
five
brickmakers
on
lincoln
island
had
not
made
more
than
three
thousand
which
were
ranged
near
each
other
until
the
time
when
their
complete
desiccation
would
permit
them
to
be
used
in
building
the
oven
that
is
to
say
in
three
or
four
days
it
was
on
the
2nd
of
april
that
harding
had
employed
himself
in
fixing
the
orientation
of
the
island
or
in
other
words
the
precise
spot
where
the
sun
rose
the
day
before
he
had
noted
exactly
the
hour
when
the
sun
disappeared
beneath
the
horizon
making
allowance
for
the
refraction
this
morning
he
noted
no
less
exactly
the
hour
at
which
it
reappeared
between
this
setting
and
rising
twelve
hours
twentyfour
minutes
passed
then
six
hours
twelve
minutes
after
its
rising
the
sun
on
this
day
would
exactly
pass
the
meridian
and
the
point
of
the
sky
which
it
occupied
at
this
moment
would
be
the
north
at
the
said
hour
cyrus
marked
this
point
and
putting
in
a
line
with
the
sun
two
trees
which
would
serve
him
for
marks
he
thus
obtained
an
invariable
meridian
for
his
ulterior
operations
the
settlers
employed
the
two
days
before
the
oven
was
built
in
collecting
fuel
branches
were
cut
all
round
the
glade
and
they
picked
up
all
the
fallen
wood
under
the
trees
they
were
also
able
to
hunt
with
greater
success
since
pencroft
now
possessed
some
dozen
arrows
armed
with
sharp
points
it
was
top
who
had
furnished
these
points
by
bringing
in
a
porcupine
rather
inferior
eating
but
of
great
value
thanks
to
the
quills
with
which
it
bristled
these
quills
were
fixed
firmly
at
the
ends
of
the
arrows
the
flight
of
which
was
made
more
certain
by
some
cockatoos
feathers
the
reporter
and
herbert
soon
became
very
skilful
archers
game
of
all
sorts
in
consequence
abounded
at
the
chimneys
capybaras
pigeons
agouties
grouse
etc
the
greater
part
of
these
animals
were
killed
in
the
part
of
the
forest
on
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
jacamar
wood
in
remembrance
of
the
bird
which
pencroft
and
herbert
had
pursued
when
on
their
first
exploration
this
game
was
eaten
fresh
but
they
preserved
some
capybara
hams
by
smoking
them
above
a
fire
of
green
wood
after
having
perfumed
them
with
sweetsmelling
leaves
however
this
food
although
very
strengthening
was
always
roast
upon
roast
and
the
party
would
have
been
delighted
to
hear
some
soup
bubbling
on
the
hearth
but
they
must
wait
till
a
pot
could
be
made
and
consequently
till
the
oven
was
built
during
these
excursions
which
were
not
extended
far
from
the
brickfield
the
hunters
could
discern
the
recent
passage
of
animals
of
a
large
size
armed
with
powerful
claws
but
they
could
not
recognize
the
species
cyrus
harding
advised
them
to
be
very
careful
as
the
forest
probably
enclosed
many
dangerous
beasts
and
he
did
right
indeed
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
one
day
saw
an
animal
which
resembled
a
jaguar
happily
the
creature
did
not
attack
them
or
they
might
not
have
escaped
without
a
severe
wound
as
soon
as
he
could
get
a
regular
weapon
that
is
to
say
one
of
the
guns
which
pencroft
begged
for
gideon
spilett
resolved
to
make
desperate
war
against
the
ferocious
beasts
and
exterminate
them
from
the
island
the
chimneys
during
these
few
days
was
not
made
more
comfortable
for
the
engineer
hoped
to
discover
or
build
if
necessary
a
more
convenient
dwelling
they
contented
themselves
with
spreading
moss
and
dry
leaves
on
the
sand
of
the
passages
and
on
these
primitive
couches
the
tired
workers
slept
soundly
they
also
reckoned
the
days
they
had
passed
on
lincoln
island
and
from
that
time
kept
a
regular
account
the
5th
of
april
which
was
wednesday
was
twelve
days
from
the
time
when
the
wind
threw
the
castaways
on
this
shore
on
the
6th
of
april
at
daybreak
the
engineer
and
his
companions
were
collected
in
the
glade
at
the
place
where
they
were
going
to
perform
the
operation
of
baking
the
bricks
naturally
this
had
to
be
in
the
open
air
and
not
in
a
kiln
or
rather
the
agglomeration
of
bricks
made
an
enormous
kiln
which
would
bake
itself
the
fuel
made
of
wellprepared
fagots
was
laid
on
the
ground
and
surrounded
with
several
rows
of
dried
bricks
which
soon
formed
an
enormous
cube
to
the
exterior
of
which
they
contrived
airholes
the
work
lasted
all
day
and
it
was
not
till
the
evening
that
they
set
fire
to
the
fagots
no
one
slept
that
night
all
watching
carefully
to
keep
up
the
fire
the
operation
lasted
fortyeight
hours
and
succeeded
perfectly
it
then
became
necessary
to
leave
the
smoking
mass
to
cool
and
during
this
time
neb
and
pencroft
guided
by
cyrus
harding
brought
on
a
hurdle
made
of
interlaced
branches
loads
of
carbonate
of
lime
and
common
stones
which
were
very
abundant
to
the
north
of
the
lake
these
stones
when
decomposed
by
heat
made
a
very
strong
quicklime
greatly
increased
by
slacking
at
least
as
pure
as
if
it
had
been
produced
by
the
calcination
of
chalk
or
marble
mixed
with
sand
the
lime
made
excellent
mortar
the
result
of
these
different
works
was
that
on
the
9th
of
april
the
engineer
had
at
his
disposal
a
quantity
of
prepared
lime
and
some
thousands
of
bricks
without
losing
an
instant
therefore
they
began
the
construction
of
a
kiln
to
bake
the
pottery
which
was
indispensable
for
their
domestic
use
they
succeeded
without
much
difficulty
five
days
after
the
kiln
was
supplied
with
coal
which
the
engineer
had
discovered
lying
open
to
the
sky
towards
the
mouth
of
the
red
creek
and
the
first
smoke
escaped
from
a
chimney
twenty
feet
high
the
glade
was
transformed
into
a
manufactory
and
pencroft
was
not
far
wrong
in
believing
that
from
this
kiln
would
issue
all
the
products
of
modern
industry
in
the
meantime
what
the
settlers
first
manufactured
was
a
common
pottery
in
which
to
cook
their
food
the
chief
material
was
clay
to
which
harding
added
a
little
lime
and
quartz
this
paste
made
regular
pipeclay
with
which
they
manufactured
bowls
cups
molded
on
stones
of
a
proper
size
great
jars
and
pots
to
hold
water
etc
the
shape
of
these
objects
was
clumsy
and
defective
but
after
they
had
been
baked
in
a
high
temperature
the
kitchen
of
the
chimneys
was
provided
with
a
number
of
utensils
as
precious
to
the
settlers
as
the
most
beautifully
enameled
china
we
must
mention
here
that
pencroft
desirous
to
know
if
the
clay
thus
prepared
was
worthy
of
its
name
of
pipeclay
made
some
large
pipes
which
he
thought
charming
but
for
which
alas
he
had
no
tobacco
and
that
was
a
great
privation
to
pencroft
but
tobacco
will
come
like
everything
else
he
repeated
in
a
burst
of
absolute
confidence
this
work
lasted
till
the
15th
of
april
and
the
time
was
well
employed
the
settlers
having
become
potters
made
nothing
but
pottery
when
it
suited
cyrus
harding
to
change
them
into
smiths
they
would
become
smiths
but
the
next
day
being
sunday
and
also
easter
sunday
all
agreed
to
sanctify
the
day
by
rest
these
americans
were
religious
men
scrupulous
observers
of
the
precepts
of
the
bible
and
their
situation
could
not
but
develop
sentiments
of
confidence
towards
the
author
of
all
things
on
the
evening
of
the
15th
of
april
they
returned
to
the
chimneys
carrying
with
them
the
pottery
the
furnace
being
extinguished
until
they
could
put
it
to
a
new
use
their
return
was
marked
by
a
fortunate
incident
the
engineer
discovered
a
substance
which
replaced
tinder
it
is
known
that
a
spongy
velvety
flesh
is
procured
from
a
certain
mushroom
of
the
genus
polyporous
properly
prepared
it
is
extremely
inflammable
especially
when
it
has
been
previously
saturated
with
gunpowder
or
boiled
in
a
solution
of
nitrate
or
chlorate
of
potash
but
till
then
they
had
not
found
any
of
these
polypores
or
even
any
of
the
morels
which
could
replace
them
on
this
day
the
engineer
seeing
a
plant
belonging
to
the
wormwood
genus
the
principal
species
of
which
are
absinthe
balmmint
tarragon
etc
gathered
several
tufts
and
presenting
them
to
the
sailor
said
here
pencroft
this
will
please
you
pencroft
looked
attentively
at
the
plant
covered
with
long
silky
hair
the
leaves
being
clothed
with
soft
down
whats
that
captain
asked
pencroft
is
it
tobacco
no
replied
harding
it
is
wormwood
chinese
wormwood
to
the
learned
but
to
us
it
will
be
tinder
when
the
wormwood
was
properly
dried
it
provided
them
with
a
very
inflammable
substance
especially
afterwards
when
the
engineer
had
impregnated
it
with
nitrate
of
potash
of
which
the
island
possessed
several
beds
and
which
is
in
truth
saltpeter
the
colonists
had
a
good
supper
that
evening
neb
prepared
some
agouti
soup
a
smoked
capybara
ham
to
which
was
added
the
boiled
tubercules
of
the
caladium
macrorhizum
an
herbaceous
plant
of
the
arum
family
they
had
an
excellent
taste
and
were
very
nutritious
being
something
similar
to
the
substance
which
is
sold
in
england
under
the
name
of
portland
sago
they
were
also
a
good
substitute
for
bread
which
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
did
not
yet
possess
when
supper
was
finished
before
sleeping
harding
and
his
companions
went
to
take
the
air
on
the
beach
it
was
eight
oclock
in
the
evening
the
night
was
magnificent
the
moon
which
had
been
full
five
days
before
had
not
yet
risen
but
the
horizon
was
already
silvered
by
those
soft
pale
shades
which
might
be
called
the
dawn
of
the
moon
at
the
southern
zenith
glittered
the
circumpolar
constellations
and
above
all
the
southern
cross
which
some
days
before
the
engineer
had
greeted
on
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
cyrus
harding
gazed
for
some
time
at
this
splendid
constellation
which
has
at
its
summit
and
at
its
base
two
stars
of
the
first
magnitude
at
its
left
arm
a
star
of
the
second
and
at
its
right
arm
a
star
of
the
third
magnitude
then
after
some
minutes
thought
herbert
he
asked
of
the
lad
is
not
this
the
15th
of
april
yes
captain
replied
herbert
well
if
i
am
not
mistaken
tomorrow
will
be
one
of
the
four
days
in
the
year
in
which
the
real
time
is
identical
with
average
time
that
is
to
say
my
boy
that
tomorrow
to
within
some
seconds
the
sun
will
pass
the
meridian
just
at
midday
by
the
clocks
if
the
weather
is
fine
i
think
that
i
shall
obtain
the
longitude
of
the
island
with
an
approximation
of
some
degrees
without
instruments
without
sextant
asked
gideon
spilett
yes
replied
the
engineer
also
since
the
night
is
clear
i
will
try
this
very
evening
to
obtain
our
latitude
by
calculating
the
height
of
the
southern
cross
that
is
from
the
southern
pole
above
the
horizon
you
understand
my
friends
that
before
undertaking
the
work
of
installation
in
earnest
it
is
not
enough
to
have
found
out
that
this
land
is
an
island
we
must
as
nearly
as
possible
know
at
what
distance
it
is
situated
either
from
the
american
continent
or
australia
or
from
the
principal
archipelagoes
of
the
pacific
in
fact
said
the
reporter
instead
of
building
a
house
it
would
be
more
important
to
build
a
boat
if
by
chance
we
are
not
more
than
a
hundred
miles
from
an
inhabited
coast
that
is
why
returned
harding
i
am
going
to
try
this
evening
to
calculate
the
latitude
of
lincoln
island
and
tomorrow
at
midday
i
will
try
to
calculate
the
longitude
if
the
engineer
had
possessed
a
sextant
an
apparatus
with
which
the
angular
distance
of
objects
can
be
measured
with
great
precision
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
in
the
operation
this
evening
by
the
height
of
the
pole
the
next
day
by
the
passing
of
the
sun
at
the
meridian
he
would
obtain
the
position
of
the
island
but
as
they
had
not
one
he
would
have
to
supply
the
deficiency
harding
then
entered
the
chimneys
by
the
light
of
the
fire
he
cut
two
little
flat
rulers
which
he
joined
together
at
one
end
so
as
to
form
a
pair
of
compasses
whose
legs
could
separate
or
come
together
the
fastening
was
fixed
with
a
strong
acacia
thorn
which
was
found
in
the
wood
pile
this
instrument
finished
the
engineer
returned
to
the
beach
but
as
it
was
necessary
to
take
the
height
of
the
pole
from
above
a
clear
horizon
that
is
a
sea
horizon
and
as
claw
cape
hid
the
southern
horizon
he
was
obliged
to
look
for
a
more
suitable
station
the
best
would
evidently
have
been
the
shore
exposed
directly
to
the
south
but
the
mercy
would
have
to
be
crossed
and
that
was
a
difficulty
harding
resolved
in
consequence
to
make
his
observation
from
prospect
heights
taking
into
consideration
its
height
above
the
level
of
the
seaa
height
which
he
intended
to
calculate
next
day
by
a
simple
process
of
elementary
geometry
the
settlers
therefore
went
to
the
plateau
ascending
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
and
placed
themselves
on
the
edge
which
looked
northwest
and
southeast
that
is
above
the
curiouslyshaped
rocks
which
bordered
the
river
this
part
of
the
plateau
commanded
the
heights
of
the
left
bank
which
sloped
away
to
the
extremity
of
claw
cape
and
to
the
southern
side
of
the
island
no
obstacle
intercepted
their
gaze
which
swept
the
horizon
in
a
semicircle
from
the
cape
to
reptile
end
to
the
south
the
horizon
lighted
by
the
first
rays
of
the
moon
was
very
clearly
defined
against
the
sky
at
this
moment
the
southern
cross
presented
itself
to
the
observer
in
an
inverted
position
the
star
alpha
marking
its
base
which
is
nearer
to
the
southern
pole
this
constellation
is
not
situated
as
near
to
the
antarctic
pole
as
the
polar
star
is
to
the
arctic
pole
the
star
alpha
is
about
twentyseven
degrees
from
it
but
cyrus
harding
knew
this
and
made
allowance
for
it
in
his
calculation
he
took
care
also
to
observe
the
moment
when
it
passed
the
meridian
below
the
pole
which
would
simplify
the
operation
cyrus
harding
pointed
one
leg
of
the
compasses
to
the
horizon
the
other
to
alpha
and
the
space
between
the
two
legs
gave
him
the
angular
distance
which
separated
alpha
from
the
horizon
in
order
to
fix
the
angle
obtained
he
fastened
with
thorns
the
two
pieces
of
wood
on
a
third
placed
transversely
so
that
their
separation
should
be
properly
maintained
that
done
there
was
only
the
angle
to
calculate
by
bringing
back
the
observation
to
the
level
of
the
sea
taking
into
consideration
the
depression
of
the
horizon
which
would
necessitate
measuring
the
height
of
the
cliff
the
value
of
this
angle
would
give
the
height
of
alpha
and
consequently
that
of
the
pole
above
the
horizon
that
is
to
say
the
latitude
of
the
island
since
the
latitude
of
a
point
of
the
globe
is
always
equal
to
the
height
of
the
pole
above
the
horizon
of
this
point
the
calculations
were
left
for
the
next
day
and
at
ten
oclock
every
one
was
sleeping
soundly

the
next
day
the
16th
of

and
easter
sunday
the
settlers
issued
from
the
chimneys
at
daybreak
and
proceeded
to
wash
their
linen
the
engineer
intended
to
manufacture
soap
as
soon
as
he
could
procure
the
necessary
materialssoda
or
potash
fat
or
oil
the
important
question
of
renewing
their
wardrobe
would
be
treated
of
in
the
proper
time
and
place
at
any
rate
their
clothes
would
last
at
least
six
months
longer
for
they
were
strong
and
could
resist
the
wear
of
manual
labor
but
all
would
depend
on
the
situation
of
the
island
with
regard
to
inhabited
land
this
would
be
settled
today
if
the
weather
permitted
the
sun
rising
above
a
clear
horizon
announced
a
magnificent
day
one
of
those
beautiful
autumn
days
which
are
like
the
last
farewells
of
the
warm
season
it
was
now
necessary
to
complete
the
observations
of
the
evening
before
by
measuring
the
height
of
the
cliff
above
the
level
of
the
sea
shall
you
not
need
an
instrument
similar
to
the
one
which
you
used
yesterday
said
herbert
to
the
engineer
no
my
boy
replied
the
latter
we
are
going
to
proceed
differently
but
in
as
precise
a
way
herbert
wishing
to
learn
everything
he
could
followed
the
engineer
to
the
beach
pencroft
neb
and
the
reporter
remained
behind
and
occupied
themselves
in
different
ways
cyrus
harding
had
provided
himself
with
a
straight
stick
twelve
feet
long
which
he
had
measured
as
exactly
as
possible
by
comparing
it
with
his
own
height
which
he
knew
to
a
hair
herbert
carried
a
plumbline
which
harding
had
given
him
that
is
to
say
a
simple
stone
fastened
to
the
end
of
a
flexible
fiber
having
reached
a
spot
about
twenty
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
beach
and
nearly
five
hundred
feet
from
the
cliff
which
rose
perpendicularly
harding
thrust
the
pole
two
feet
into
the
sand
and
wedging
it
up
carefully
he
managed
by
means
of
the
plumbline
to
erect
it
perpendicularly
with
the
plane
of
the
horizon
that
done
he
retired
the
necessary
distance
when
lying
on
the
sand
his
eye
glanced
at
the
same
time
at
the
top
of
the
pole
and
the
crest
of
the
cliff
he
carefully
marked
the
place
with
a
little
stick
then
addressing
herbertdo
you
know
the
first
principles
of
geometry
he
asked
slightly
captain
replied
herbert
who
did
not
wish
to
put
himself
forward
you
remember
what
are
the
properties
of
two
similar
triangles
yes
replied
herbert
their
homologous
sides
are
proportional
well
my
boy
i
have
just
constructed
two
similar
rightangled
triangles
the
first
the
smallest
has
for
its
sides
the
perpendicular
pole
the
distance
which
separates
the
little
stick
from
the
foot
of
the
pole
and
my
visual
ray
for
hypothenuse
the
second
has
for
its
sides
the
perpendicular
cliff
the
height
of
which
we
wish
to
measure
the
distance
which
separates
the
little
stick
from
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
and
my
visual
ray
also
forms
its
hypothenuse
which
proves
to
be
prolongation
of
that
of
the
first
triangle
ah
captain
i
understand
cried
herbert
as
the
distance
from
the
stick
to
the
pole
is
to
the
distance
from
the
stick
to
the
base
of
the
cliff
so
is
the
height
of
the
pole
to
the
height
of
the
cliff
just
so
herbert
replied
the
engineer
and
when
we
have
measured
the
two
first
distances
knowing
the
height
of
the
pole
we
shall
only
have
a
sum
in
proportion
to
do
which
will
give
us
the
height
of
the
cliff
and
will
save
us
the
trouble
of
measuring
it
directly
the
two
horizontal
distances
were
found
out
by
means
of
the
pole
whose
length
above
the
sand
was
exactly
ten
feet
the
first
distance
was
fifteen
feet
between
the
stick
and
the
place
where
the
pole
was
thrust
into
the
sand
the
second
distance
between
the
stick
and
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
was
five
hundred
feet
these
measurements
finished
cyrus
harding
and
the
lad
returned
to
the
chimneys
the
engineer
then
took
a
flat
stone
which
he
had
brought
back
from
one
of
his
previous
excursions
a
sort
of
slate
on
which
it
was
easy
to
trace
figures
with
a
sharp
shell
he
then
proved
the
following
proportions
1550010x
500
x
10

5000
5000

15

3333
from
which
it
was
proved
that
the
granite
cliff
measured
333
feet
in
height
cyrus
harding
then
took
the
instrument
which
he
had
made
the
evening
before
the
space
between
its
two
legs
giving
the
angular
distance
between
the
star
alpha
and
the
horizon
he
measured
very
exactly
the
opening
of
this
angle
on
a
circumference
which
he
divided
into
360
equal
parts
now
this
angle
by
adding
to
it
the
twentyseven
degrees
which
separated
alpha
from
the
antarctic
pole
and
by
reducing
to
the
level
of
the
sea
the
height
of
the
cliff
on
which
the
observation
had
been
made
was
found
to
be
fiftythree
degrees
these
fiftythree
degrees
being
subtracted
from
ninety
degreesthe
distance
from
the
pole
to
the
equatorthere
remained
thirtyseven
degrees
cyrus
harding
concluded
therefore
that
lincoln
island
was
situated
on
the
thirtyseventh
degree
of
the
southern
latitude
or
taking
into
consideration
through
the
imperfection
of
the
performance
an
error
of
five
degrees
that
it
must
be
situated
between
the
thirtyfifth
and
the
fortieth
parallel
there
was
only
the
longitude
to
be
obtained
and
the
position
of
the
island
would
be
determined
the
engineer
hoped
to
attempt
this
the
same
day
at
twelve
oclock
at
which
moment
the
sun
would
pass
the
meridian
it
was
decided
that
sunday
should
be
spent
in
a
walk
or
rather
an
exploring
expedition
to
that
side
of
the
island
between
the
north
of
the
lake
and
shark
gulf
and
if
there
was
time
they
would
push
their
discoveries
to
the
northern
side
of
cape
south
mandible
they
would
breakfast
on
the
downs
and
not
return
till
evening
at
halfpast
eight
the
little
band
was
following
the
edge
of
the
channel
on
the
other
side
on
safety
islet
numerous
birds
were
gravely
strutting
they
were
divers
easily
recognized
by
their
cry
which
much
resembles
the
braying
of
a
donkey
pencroft
only
considered
them
in
an
eatable
point
of
view
and
learnt
with
some
satisfaction
that
their
flesh
though
blackish
is
not
bad
food
great
amphibious
creatures
could
also
be
seen
crawling
on
the
sand
seals
doubtless
who
appeared
to
have
chosen
the
islet
for
a
place
of
refuge
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
those
animals
in
an
alimentary
point
of
view
for
their
oily
flesh
is
detestable
however
cyrus
harding
observed
them
attentively
and
without
making
known
his
idea
he
announced
to
his
companions
that
very
soon
they
would
pay
a
visit
to
the
islet
the
beach
was
strewn
with
innumerable
shells
some
of
which
would
have
rejoiced
the
heart
of
a
conchologist
there
were
among
others
the
phasianella
the
terebratual
etc
but
what
would
be
of
more
use
was
the
discovery
by
neb
at
low
tide
of
a
large
oysterbed
among
the
rocks
nearly
five
miles
from
the
chimneys
neb
will
not
have
lost
his
day
cried
pencroft
looking
at
the
spacious
oysterbed
it
is
really
a
fortunate
discovery
said
the
reporter
and
as
it
is
said
that
each
oyster
produces
yearly
from
fifty
to
sixty
thousand
eggs
we
shall
have
an
inexhaustible
supply
there
only
i
believe
that
the
oyster
is
not
very
nourishing
said
herbert
no
replied
harding
the
oyster
contains
very
little
nitrogen
and
if
a
man
lived
exclusively
on
them
he
would
have
to
eat
not
less
than
fifteen
to
sixteen
dozen
a
day
capital
replied
pencroft
we
might
swallow
dozens
and
dozens
without
exhausting
the
bed
shall
we
take
some
for
breakfast
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
to
this
proposal
knowing
that
it
would
be
approved
of
the
sailor
and
neb
detached
a
quantity
of
the
molluscs
they
put
them
in
a
sort
of
net
of
hibiscus
fiber
which
neb
had
manufactured
and
which
already
contained
food
they
then
continued
to
climb
the
coast
between
the
downs
and
the
sea
from
time
to
time
harding
consulted
his
watch
so
as
to
be
prepared
in
time
for
the
solar
observation
which
had
to
be
made
exactly
at
midday
all
that
part
of
the
island
was
very
barren
as
far
as
the
point
which
closed
union
bay
and
which
had
received
the
name
of
cape
south
mandible
nothing
could
be
seen
there
but
sand
and
shells
mingled
with
debris
of
lava
a
few
seabirds
frequented
this
desolate
coast
gulls
great
albatrosses
as
well
as
wild
duck
for
which
pencroft
had
a
great
fancy
he
tried
to
knock
some
over
with
an
arrow
but
without
result
for
they
seldom
perched
and
he
could
not
hit
them
on
the
wing
this
led
the
sailor
to
repeat
to
the
engineer
you
see
captain
so
long
as
we
have
not
one
or
two
fowlingpieces
we
shall
never
get
anything
doubtless
pencroft
replied
the
reporter
but
it
depends
on
you
procure
us
some
iron
for
the
barrels
steel
for
the
hammers
saltpeter
coal
and
sulphur
for
powder
mercury
and
nitric
acid
for
the
fulminate
and
lead
for
the
shot
and
the
captain
will
make
us
firstrate
guns
oh
replied
the
engineer
we
might
no
doubt
find
all
these
substances
on
the
island
but
a
gun
is
a
delicate
instrument
and
needs
very
particular
tools
however
we
shall
see
later
why
cried
pencroft
were
we
obliged
to
throw
overboard
all
the
weapons
we
had
with
us
in
the
car
all
our
implements
even
our
pocketknives
but
if
we
had
not
thrown
them
away
pencroft
the
balloon
would
have
thrown
us
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
said
herbert
what
you
say
is
true
my
boy
replied
the
sailor
then
passing
to
another
ideathink
said
he
how
astounded
jonathan
forster
and
his
companions
must
have
been
when
next
morning
they
found
the
place
empty
and
the
machine
flown
away
i
am
utterly
indifferent
about
knowing
what
they
may
have
thought
said
the
reporter
it
was
all
my
idea
that
said
pencroft
with
a
satisfied
air
a
splendid
idea
pencroft
replied
gideon
spilett
laughing
and
which
has
placed
us
where
we
are
i
would
rather
be
here
than
in
the
hands
of
the
southerners
cried
the
sailor
especially
since
the
captain
has
been
kind
enough
to
come
and
join
us
again
so
would
i
truly
replied
the
reporter
besides
what
do
we
want
nothing
if
that
is
noteverything
replied
pencroft
laughing
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
but
some
day
or
other
we
shall
find
means
of
going
away
sooner
perhaps
than
you
imagine
my
friends
remarked
the
engineer
if
lincoln
island
is
but
a
medium
distance
from
an
inhabited
island
or
from
a
continent
we
shall
know
in
an
hour
i
have
not
a
map
of
the
pacific
but
my
memory
has
preserved
a
very
clear
recollection
of
its
southern
part
the
latitude
which
i
obtained
yesterday
placed
new
zealand
to
the
west
of
lincoln
island
and
the
coast
of
chile
to
the
east
but
between
these
two
countries
there
is
a
distance
of
at
least
six
thousand
miles
it
has
therefore
to
be
determined
what
point
in
this
great
space
the
island
occupies
and
this
the
longitude
will
give
us
presently
with
a
sufficient
approximation
i
hope
is
not
the
archipelago
of
the
pomoutous
the
nearest
point
to
us
in
latitude
asked
herbert
yes
replied
the
engineer
but
the
distance
which
separates
us
from
it
is
more
than
twelve
hundred
miles
and
that
way
asked
neb
who
followed
the
conversation
with
extreme
interest
pointing
to
the
south
that
way
nothing
replied
pencroft
nothing
indeed
added
the
engineer
well
cyrus
asked
the
reporter
if
lincoln
island
is
not
more
than
two
or
three
thousand
miles
from
new
zealand
or
chile
well
replied
the
engineer
instead
of
building
a
house
we
will
build
a
boat
and
master
pencroft
shall
be
put
in
command
well
then
cried
the
sailor
i
am
quite
ready
to
be
captainas
soon
as
you
can
make
a
craft
thats
able
to
keep
at
sea
we
shall
do
it
if
it
is
necessary
replied
cyrus
harding
but
while
these
men
who
really
hesitated
at
nothing
were
talking
the
hour
approached
at
which
the
observation
was
to
be
made
what
cyrus
harding
was
to
do
to
ascertain
the
passage
of
the
sun
at
the
meridian
of
the
island
without
an
instrument
of
any
sort
herbert
could
not
guess
the
observers
were
then
about
six
miles
from
the
chimneys
not
far
from
that
part
of
the
downs
in
which
the
engineer
had
been
found
after
his
enigmatical
preservation
they
halted
at
this
place
and
prepared
for
breakfast
for
it
was
halfpast
eleven
herbert
went
for
some
fresh
water
from
a
stream
which
ran
near
and
brought
it
back
in
a
jug
which
neb
had
provided
during
these
preparations
harding
arranged
everything
for
his
astronomical
observation
he
chose
a
clear
place
on
the
shore
which
the
ebbing
tide
had
left
perfectly
level
this
bed
of
fine
sand
was
as
smooth
as
ice
not
a
grain
out
of
place
it
was
of
little
importance
whether
it
was
horizontal
or
not
and
it
did
not
matter
much
whether
the
stick
six
feet
high
which
was
planted
there
rose
perpendicularly
on
the
contrary
the
engineer
inclined
it
towards
the
south
that
is
to
say
in
the
direction
of
the
coast
opposite
to
the
sun
for
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
as
the
island
was
situated
in
the
southern
hemisphere
saw
the
radiant
planet
describe
its
diurnal
arc
above
the
northern
and
not
above
the
southern
horizon
herbert
now
understood
how
the
engineer
was
going
to
proceed
to
ascertain
the
culmination
of
the
sun
that
is
to
say
its
passing
the
meridian
of
the
island
or
in
other
words
determine
due
south
it
was
by
means
of
the
shadow
cast
on
the
sand
by
the
stick
a
way
which
for
want
of
an
instrument
would
give
him
a
suitable
approach
to
the
result
which
he
wished
to
obtain
in
fact
the
moment
when
this
shadow
would
reach
its
minimum
of
length
would
be
exactly
twelve
oclock
and
it
would
be
enough
to
watch
the
extremity
of
the
shadow
so
as
to
ascertain
the
instant
when
after
having
successively
diminished
it
began
to
lengthen
by
inclining
his
stick
to
the
side
opposite
to
the
sun
cyrus
harding
made
the
shadow
longer
and
consequently
its
modifications
would
be
more
easily
ascertained
in
fact
the
longer
the
needle
of
a
dial
is
the
more
easily
can
the
movement
of
its
point
be
followed
the
shadow
of
the
stick
was
nothing
but
the
needle
of
a
dial
the
moment
had
come
and
cyrus
harding
knelt
on
the
sand
and
with
little
wooden
pegs
which
he
stuck
into
the
sand
he
began
to
mark
the
successive
diminutions
of
the
sticks
shadow
his
companions
bending
over
him
watched
the
operation
with
extreme
interest
the
reporter
held
his
chronometer
in
his
hand
ready
to
tell
the
hour
which
it
marked
when
the
shadow
would
be
at
its
shortest
moreover
as
cyrus
harding
was
working
on
the
16th
of
april
the
day
on
which
the
true
and
the
average
time
are
identical
the
hour
given
by
gideon
spilett
would
be
the
true
hour
then
at
washington
which
would
simplify
the
calculation
meanwhile
as
the
sun
slowly
advanced
the
shadow
slowly
diminished
and
when
it
appeared
to
cyrus
harding
that
it
was
beginning
to
increase
he
asked
what
oclock
is
it
one
minute
past
five
replied
gideon
spilett
directly
they
had
now
only
to
calculate
the
operation
nothing
could
be
easier
it
could
be
seen
that
there
existed
in
round
numbers
a
difference
of
five
hours
between
the
meridian
of
washington
and
that
of
lincoln
island
that
is
to
say
it
was
midday
in
lincoln
island
when
it
was
already
five
oclock
in
the
evening
in
washington
now
the
sun
in
its
apparent
movement
round
the
earth
traverses
one
degree
in
four
minutes
or
fifteen
degrees
an
hour
fifteen
degrees
multiplied
by
five
hours
give
seventyfive
degrees
then
since
washington
is
77deg
3
11
as
much
as
to
say
seventyseven
degrees
counted
from
the
meridian
of
greenwich
which
the
americans
take
for
their
startingpoint
for
longitudes
concurrently
with
the
englishit
followed
that
the
island
must
be
situated
seventyseven
and
seventyfive
degrees
west
of
the
meridian
of
greenwich
that
is
to
say
on
the
hundred
and
fiftysecond
degree
of
west
longitude
cyrus
harding
announced
this
result
to
his
companions
and
taking
into
consideration
errors
of
observation
as
he
had
done
for
the
latitude
he
believed
he
could
positively
affirm
that
the
position
of
lincoln
island
was
between
the
thirtyfifth
and
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
and
between
the
hundred
and
fiftieth
and
the
hundred
and
fiftyfifth
meridian
to
the
west
of
the
meridian
of
greenwich
the
possible
fault
which
he
attributed
to
errors
in
the
observation
was
it
may
be
seen
of
five
degrees
on
both
sides
which
at
sixty
miles
to
a
degree
would
give
an
error
of
three
hundred
miles
in
latitude
and
longitude
for
the
exact
position
but
this
error
would
not
influence
the
determination
which
it
was
necessary
to
take
it
was
very
evident
that
lincoln
island
was
at
such
a
distance
from
every
country
or
island
that
it
would
be
too
hazardous
to
attempt
to
reach
one
in
a
frail
boat
in
fact
this
calculation
placed
it
at
least
twelve
hundred
miles
from
tahiti
and
the
islands
of
the
archipelago
of
the
pomoutous
more
than
eighteen
hundred
miles
from
new
zealand
and
more
than
four
thousand
five
hundred
miles
from
the
american
coast
and
when
cyrus
harding
consulted
his
memory
he
could
not
remember
in
any
way
that
such
an
island
occupied
in
that
part
of
the
pacific
the
situation
assigned
to
lincoln
island
chapter
15
the
next
day
the
17th
of
april
the
sailors
first
words
were
addressed
to
gideon
spilett
well
sir
he
asked
what
shall
we
do
today
what
the
captain
pleases
replied
the
reporter
till
then
the
engineers
companions
had
been
brickmakers
and
potters
now
they
were
to
become
metallurgists
the
day
before
after
breakfast
they
had
explored
as
far
as
the
point
of
mandible
cape
seven
miles
distant
from
the
chimneys
there
the
long
series
of
downs
ended
and
the
soil
had
a
volcanic
appearance
there
were
no
longer
high
cliffs
as
at
prospect
heights
but
a
strange
and
capricious
border
which
surrounded
the
narrow
gulf
between
the
two
capes
formed
of
mineral
matter
thrown
up
by
the
volcano
arrived
at
this
point
the
settlers
retraced
their
steps
and
at
nightfall
entered
the
chimneys
but
they
did
not
sleep
before
the
question
of
knowing
whether
they
could
think
of
leaving
lincoln
island
or
not
was
definitely
settled
the
twelve
hundred
miles
which
separated
the
island
from
the
pomoutous
island
was
a
considerable
distance
a
boat
could
not
cross
it
especially
at
the
approach
of
the
bad
season
pencroft
had
expressly
declared
this
now
to
construct
a
simple
boat
even
with
the
necessary
tools
was
a
difficult
work
and
the
colonists
not
having
tools
they
must
begin
by
making
hammers
axes
adzes
saws
augers
planes
etc
which
would
take
some
time
it
was
decided
therefore
that
they
would
winter
at
lincoln
island
and
that
they
would
look
for
a
more
comfortable
dwelling
than
the
chimneys
in
which
to
pass
the
winter
months
before
anything
else
could
be
done
it
was
necessary
to
make
the
iron
ore
of
which
the
engineer
had
observed
some
traces
in
the
northwest
part
of
the
island
fit
for
use
by
converting
it
either
into
iron
or
into
steel
metals
are
not
generally
found
in
the
ground
in
a
pure
state
for
the
most
part
they
are
combined
with
oxygen
or
sulphur
such
was
the
case
with
the
two
specimens
which
cyrus
harding
had
brought
back
one
of
magnetic
iron
not
carbonated
the
other
a
pyrite
also
called
sulphuret
of
iron
it
was
therefore
the
first
the
oxide
of
iron
which
they
must
reduce
with
coal
that
is
to
say
get
rid
of
the
oxygen
to
obtain
it
in
a
pure
state
this
reduction
is
made
by
subjecting
the
ore
with
coal
to
a
high
temperature
either
by
the
rapid
and
easy
catalan
method
which
has
the
advantage
of
transforming
the
ore
into
iron
in
a
single
operation
or
by
the
blast
furnace
which
first
smelts
the
ore
then
changes
it
into
iron
by
carrying
away
the
three
to
four
per
cent
of
coal
which
is
combined
with
it
now
cyrus
harding
wanted
iron
and
he
wished
to
obtain
it
as
soon
as
possible
the
ore
which
he
had
picked
up
was
in
itself
very
pure
and
rich
it
was
the
oxydulous
iron
which
is
found
in
confused
masses
of
a
deep
gray
color
it
gives
a
black
dust
crystallized
in
the
form
of
the
regular
octahedron
native
lodestones
consist
of
this
ore
and
iron
of
the
first
quality
is
made
in
europe
from
that
with
which
sweden
and
norway
are
so
abundantly
supplied
not
far
from
this
vein
was
the
vein
of
coal
already
made
use
of
by
the
settlers
the
ingredients
for
the
manufacture
being
close
together
would
greatly
facilitate
the
treatment
of
the
ore
this
is
the
cause
of
the
wealth
of
the
mines
in
great
britain
where
the
coal
aids
the
manufacture
of
the
metal
extracted
from
the
same
soil
at
the
same
time
as
itself
then
captain
said
pencroft
we
are
going
to
work
iron
ore
yes
my
friend
replied
the
engineer
and
for
thatsomething
which
will
please
youwe
must
begin
by
having
a
seal
hunt
on
the
islet
a
seal
hunt
cried
the
sailor
turning
towards
gideon
spilett
are
seals
needed
to
make
iron
since
cyrus
has
said
so
replied
the
reporter
but
the
engineer
had
already
left
the
chimneys
and
pencroft
prepared
for
the
seal
hunt
without
having
received
any
other
explanation
cyrus
harding
herbert
gideon
spilett
neb
and
the
sailor
were
soon
collected
on
the
shore
at
a
place
where
the
channel
left
a
ford
passable
at
low
tide
the
hunters
could
therefore
traverse
it
without
getting
wet
higher
than
the
knee
harding
then
put
his
foot
on
the
islet
for
the
first
and
his
companions
for
the
second
time
on
their
landing
some
hundreds
of
penguins
looked
fearlessly
at
them
the
hunters
armed
with
sticks
could
have
killed
them
easily
but
they
were
not
guilty
of
such
useless
massacre
as
it
was
important
not
to
frighten
the
seals
who
were
lying
on
the
sand
several
cable
lengths
off
they
also
respected
certain
innocentlooking
birds
whose
wings
were
reduced
to
the
state
of
stumps
spread
out
like
fins
ornamented
with
feathers
of
a
scaly
appearance
the
settlers
therefore
prudently
advanced
towards
the
north
point
walking
over
ground
riddled
with
little
holes
which
formed
nests
for
the
seabirds
towards
the
extremity
of
the
islet
appeared
great
black
heads
floating
just
above
the
water
having
exactly
the
appearance
of
rocks
in
motion
these
were
the
seals
which
were
to
be
captured
it
was
necessary
however
first
to
allow
them
to
land
for
with
their
close
short
hair
and
their
fusiform
conformation
being
excellent
swimmers
it
is
difficult
to
catch
them
in
the
sea
while
on
land
their
short
webbed
feet
prevent
their
having
more
than
a
slow
waddling
movement
pencroft
knew
the
habits
of
these
creatures
and
he
advised
waiting
till
they
were
stretched
on
the
sand
when
the
sun
before
long
would
send
them
to
sleep
they
must
then
manage
to
cut
off
their
retreat
and
knock
them
on
the
head
the
hunters
having
concealed
themselves
behind
the
rocks
waited
silently
an
hour
passed
before
the
seals
came
to
play
on
the
sand
they
could
count
half
a
dozen
pencroft
and
herbert
then
went
round
the
point
of
the
islet
so
as
to
take
them
in
the
rear
and
cut
off
their
retreat
during
this
time
cyrus
harding
spilett
and
neb
crawling
behind
the
rocks
glided
towards
the
future
scene
of
combat
all
at
once
the
tall
figure
of
the
sailor
appeared
pencroft
shouted
the
engineer
and
his
two
companions
threw
themselves
between
the
sea
and
the
seals
two
of
the
animals
soon
lay
dead
on
the
sand
but
the
rest
regained
the
sea
in
safety
here
are
the
seals
required
captain
said
the
sailor
advancing
towards
the
engineer
capital
replied
harding
we
will
make
bellows
of
them
bellows
cried
pencroft
well
these
are
lucky
seals
it
was
in
fact
a
blowingmachine
necessary
for
the
treatment
of
the
ore
that
the
engineer
wished
to
manufacture
with
the
skins
of
the
amphibious
creatures
they
were
of
a
medium
size
for
their
length
did
not
exceed
six
feet
they
resembled
a
dog
about
the
head
as
it
was
useless
to
burden
themselves
with
the
weight
of
both
the
animals
neb
and
pencroft
resolved
to
skin
them
on
the
spot
while
cyrus
harding
and
the
reporter
continued
to
explore
the
islet
the
sailor
and
the
negro
cleverly
performed
the
operation
and
three
hours
afterwards
cyrus
harding
had
at
his
disposal
two
seals
skins
which
he
intended
to
use
in
this
state
without
subjecting
them
to
any
tanning
process
the
settlers
waited
till
the
tide
was
again
low
and
crossing
the
channel
they
entered
the
chimneys
the
skins
had
then
to
be
stretched
on
a
frame
of
wood
and
sewn
by
means
of
fibers
so
as
to
preserve
the
air
without
allowing
too
much
to
escape
cyrus
harding
had
nothing
but
the
two
steel
blades
from
tops
collar
and
yet
he
was
so
clever
and
his
companions
aided
him
with
so
much
intelligence
that
three
days
afterwards
the
little
colonys
stock
of
tools
was
augmented
by
a
blowingmachine
destined
to
inject
the
air
into
the
midst
of
the
ore
when
it
should
be
subjected
to
heatan
indispensable
condition
to
the
success
of
the
operation
on
the
morning
of
the
20th
of
april
began
the
metallic
period
as
the
reporter
called
it
in
his
notes
the
engineer
had
decided
as
has
been
said
to
operate
near
the
veins
both
of
coal
and
ore
now
according
to
his
observations
these
veins
were
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
northeast
spurs
of
mount
franklin
that
is
to
say
a
distance
of
six
miles
from
their
home
it
was
impossible
therefore
to
return
every
day
to
the
chimneys
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
little
colony
should
camp
under
a
hut
of
branches
so
that
the
important
operation
could
be
followed
night
and
day
this
settled
they
set
out
in
the
morning
neb
and
pencroft
dragged
the
bellows
on
a
hurdle
also
a
quantity
of
vegetables
and
animals
which
they
besides
could
renew
on
the
way
the
road
led
through
jacamar
wood
which
they
traversed
obliquely
from
southeast
to
northwest
and
in
the
thickest
part
it
was
necessary
to
beat
a
path
which
would
in
the
future
form
the
most
direct
road
to
prospect
heights
and
mount
franklin
the
trees
belonging
to
the
species
already
discovered
were
magnificent
herbert
found
some
new
ones
among
others
some
which
pencroft
called
sham
leeks
for
in
spite
of
their
size
they
were
of
the
same
liliaceous
family
as
the
onion
chive
shallot
or
asparagus
these
trees
produce
ligneous
roots
which
when
cooked
are
excellent
from
them
by
fermentation
a
very
agreeable
liquor
is
made
they
therefore
made
a
good
store
of
the
roots
the
journey
through
the
wood
was
long
it
lasted
the
whole
day
and
so
allowed
plenty
of
time
for
examining
the
flora
and
fauna
top
who
took
special
charge
of
the
fauna
ran
through
the
grass
and
brushwood
putting
up
all
sorts
of
game
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
killed
two
kangaroos
with
bows
and
arrows
and
also
an
animal
which
strongly
resembled
both
a
hedgehog
and
an
anteater
it
was
like
the
first
because
it
rolled
itself
into
a
ball
and
bristled
with
spines
and
the
second
because
it
had
sharp
claws
a
long
slender
snout
which
terminated
in
a
birds
beak
and
an
extendible
tongue
covered
with
little
thorns
which
served
to
hold
the
insects
and
when
it
is
in
the
pot
asked
pencroft
naturally
what
will
it
be
like
an
excellent
piece
of
beef
replied
herbert
we
will
not
ask
more
from
it
replied
the
sailor
during
this
excursion
they
saw
several
wild
boars
which
however
did
not
offer
to
attack
the
little
band
and
it
appeared
as
if
they
would
not
meet
with
any
dangerous
beasts
when
in
a
thick
part
of
the
wood
the
reporter
thought
he
saw
some
paces
from
him
among
the
lower
branches
of
a
tree
an
animal
which
he
took
for
a
bear
and
which
he
very
tranquilly
began
to
draw
happily
for
gideon
spilett
the
animal
in
question
did
not
belong
to
the
redoubtable
family
of
the
plantigrades
it
was
only
a
koala
better
known
under
the
name
of
the
sloth
being
about
the
size
of
a
large
dog
and
having
stiff
hair
of
a
dirty
color
the
paws
armed
with
strong
claws
which
enabled
it
to
climb
trees
and
feed
on
the
leaves
having
identified
the
animal
which
they
did
not
disturb
gideon
spilett
erased
bear
from
the
title
of
his
sketch
putting
koala
in
its
place
and
the
journey
was
resumed
at
five
oclock
in
the
evening
cyrus
harding
gave
the
signal
to
halt
they
were
now
outside
the
forest
at
the
beginning
of
the
powerful
spurs
which
supported
mount
franklin
towards
the
west
at
a
distance
of
some
hundred
feet
flowed
the
red
creek
and
consequently
plenty
of
fresh
water
was
within
their
reach
the
camp
was
soon
organized
in
less
than
an
hour
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
among
the
trees
a
hut
of
branches
interlaced
with
creepers
and
pasted
over
with
clay
offered
a
tolerable
shelter
their
geological
researches
were
put
off
till
the
next
day
supper
was
prepared
a
good
fire
blazed
before
the
hut
the
roast
turned
and
at
eight
oclock
while
one
of
the
settlers
watched
to
keep
up
the
fire
in
case
any
wild
beasts
should
prowl
in
the
neighborhood
the
others
slept
soundly
the
next
day
the
21st
of
april
cyrus
harding
accompanied
by
herbert
went
to
look
for
the
soil
of
ancient
formation
on
which
he
had
already
discovered
a
specimen
of
ore
they
found
the
vein
above
ground
near
the
source
of
the
creek
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
northeastern
spurs
this
ore
very
rich
in
iron
enclosed
in
its
fusible
veinstone
was
perfectly
suited
to
the
mode
of
reduction
which
the
engineer
intended
to
employ
that
is
the
catalan
method
but
simplified
as
it
is
used
in
corsica
in
fact
the
catalan
method
properly
so
called
requires
the
construction
of
kilns
and
crucibles
in
which
the
ore
and
the
coal
placed
in
alternate
layers
are
transformed
and
reduced
but
cyrus
harding
intended
to
economize
these
constructions
and
wished
simply
to
form
with
the
ore
and
the
coal
a
cubic
mass
to
the
center
of
which
he
would
direct
the
wind
from
his
bellows
doubtless
it
was
the
proceeding
employed
by
tubalcain
and
the
first
metallurgists
of
the
inhabited
world
now
that
which
had
succeeded
with
the
grandson
of
adam
and
which
still
yielded
good
results
in
countries
rich
in
ore
and
fuel
could
not
but
succeed
with
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
the
coal
as
well
as
the
ore
was
collected
without
trouble
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
they
first
broke
the
ore
into
little
pieces
and
cleansed
them
with
the
hand
from
the
impurities
which
soiled
their
surface
then
coal
and
ore
were
arranged
in
heaps
and
in
successive
layers
as
the
charcoalburner
does
with
the
wood
which
he
wishes
to
carbonize
in
this
way
under
the
influence
of
the
air
projected
by
the
blowingmachine
the
coal
would
be
transformed
into
carbonic
acid
then
into
oxide
of
carbon
its
use
being
to
reduce
the
oxide
of
iron
that
is
to
say
to
rid
it
of
the
oxygen
thus
the
engineer
proceeded
the
bellows
of
sealskin
furnished
at
its
extremity
with
a
nozzle
of
clay
which
had
been
previously
fabricated
in
the
pottery
kiln
was
established
near
the
heap
of
ore
using
the
mechanism
which
consisted
of
a
frame
cords
of
fiber
and
counterpoise
he
threw
into
the
mass
an
abundance
of
air
which
by
raising
the
temperature
also
concurred
with
the
chemical
transformation
to
produce
in
time
pure
iron
the
operation
was
difficult
all
the
patience
all
the
ingenuity
of
the
settlers
was
needed
but
at
last
it
succeeded
and
the
result
was
a
lump
of
iron
reduced
to
a
spongy
state
which
it
was
necessary
to
shingle
and
fagot
that
is
to
say
to
forge
so
as
to
expel
from
it
the
liquefied
veinstone
these
amateur
smiths
had
of
course
no
hammer
but
they
were
in
no
worse
a
situation
than
the
first
metallurgist
and
therefore
did
what
no
doubt
he
had
to
do
a
handle
was
fixed
to
the
first
lump
and
was
used
as
a
hammer
to
forge
the
second
on
a
granite
anvil
and
thus
they
obtained
a
coarse
but
useful
metal
at
length
after
many
trials
and
much
fatigue
on
the
25th
of
april
several
bars
of
iron
were
forged
and
transformed
into
tools
crowbars
pincers
pickaxes
spades
etc
which
pencroft
and
neb
declared
to
be
real
jewels
but
the
metal
was
not
yet
in
its
most
serviceable
state
that
is
of
steel
now
steel
is
a
combination
of
iron
and
coal
which
is
extracted
either
from
the
liquid
ore
by
taking
from
it
the
excess
of
coal
or
from
the
iron
by
adding
to
it
the
coal
which
was
wanting
the
first
obtained
by
the
decarburation
of
the
metal
gives
natural
or
puddled
steel
the
second
produced
by
the
carburation
of
the
iron
gives
steel
of
cementation
it
was
the
last
which
cyrus
harding
intended
to
forge
as
he
possessed
iron
in
a
pure
state
he
succeeded
by
heating
the
metal
with
powdered
coal
in
a
crucible
which
had
previously
been
manufactured
from
clay
suitable
for
the
purpose
he
then
worked
this
steel
which
is
malleable
both
when
hot
or
cold
with
the
hammer
neb
and
pencroft
cleverly
directed
made
hatchets
which
heated
redhot
and
plunged
suddenly
into
cold
water
acquired
an
excellent
temper
other
instruments
of
course
roughly
fashioned
were
also
manufactured
blades
for
planes
axes
hatchets
pieces
of
steel
to
be
transformed
into
saws
chisels
then
iron
for
spades
pickaxes
hammers
nails
etc
at
last
on
the
5th
of
may
the
metallic
period
ended
the
smiths
returned
to
the
chimneys
and
new
work
would
soon
authorize
them
to
take
a
fresh
title
chapter
16
it
was
the
6th
of
may
a
day
which
corresponds
to
the
6th
of
november
in
the
countries
of
the
northern
hemisphere
the
sky
had
been
obscured
for
some
days
and
it
was
of
importance
to
make
preparations
for
the
winter
however
the
temperature
was
not
as
yet
much
lower
and
a
centigrade
thermometer
transported
to
lincoln
island
would
still
have
marked
an
average
of
ten
to
twelve
degrees
above
zero
this
was
not
surprising
since
lincoln
island
probably
situated
between
the
thirtyfifth
and
fortieth
parallel
would
be
subject
in
the
southern
hemisphere
to
the
same
climate
as
sicily
or
greece
in
the
northern
hemisphere
but
as
greece
and
sicily
have
severe
cold
producing
snow
and
ice
so
doubtless
would
lincoln
island
in
the
severest
part
of
the
winter
and
it
was
advisable
to
provide
against
it
in
any
case
if
cold
did
not
yet
threaten
them
the
rainy
season
would
begin
and
on
this
lonely
island
exposed
to
all
the
fury
of
the
elements
in
midocean
bad
weather
would
be
frequent
and
probably
terrible
the
question
of
a
more
comfortable
dwelling
than
the
chimneys
must
therefore
be
seriously
considered
and
promptly
resolved
on
pencroft
naturally
had
some
predilection
for
the
retreat
which
he
had
discovered
but
he
well
understood
that
another
must
be
found
the
chimneys
had
been
already
visited
by
the
sea
under
circumstances
which
are
known
and
it
would
not
do
to
be
exposed
again
to
a
similar
accident
besides
added
cyrus
harding
who
this
day
was
talking
of
these
things
with
his
companions
we
have
some
precautions
to
take
why
the
island
is
not
inhabited
said
the
reporter
that
is
probable
replied
the
engineer
although
we
have
not
yet
explored
the
interior
but
if
no
human
beings
are
found
i
fear
that
dangerous
animals
may
abound
it
is
necessary
to
guard
against
a
possible
attack
so
that
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
watch
every
night
or
to
keep
up
a
fire
and
then
my
friends
we
must
foresee
everything
we
are
here
in
a
part
of
the
pacific
often
frequented
by
malay
pirates
what
said
herbert
at
such
a
distance
from
land
yes
my
boy
replied
the
engineer
these
pirates
are
bold
sailors
as
well
as
formidable
enemies
and
we
must
take
measures
accordingly
well
replied
pencroft
we
will
fortify
ourselves
against
savages
with
two
legs
as
well
as
against
savages
with
four
but
captain
will
it
not
be
best
to
explore
every
part
of
the
island
before
undertaking
anything
else
that
would
be
best
added
gideon
spilett
who
knows
if
we
might
not
find
on
the
opposite
side
one
of
the
caverns
which
we
have
searched
for
in
vain
here
that
is
true
replied
the
engineer
but
you
forget
my
friends
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
establish
ourselves
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
watercourse
and
that
from
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
we
could
not
see
towards
the
west
either
stream
or
river
here
on
the
contrary
we
are
placed
between
the
mercy
and
lake
grant
an
advantage
which
must
not
be
neglected
and
besides
this
side
looking
towards
the
east
is
not
exposed
as
the
other
is
to
the
tradewinds
which
in
this
hemisphere
blow
from
the
northwest
then
captain
replied
the
sailor
let
us
build
a
house
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
neither
bricks
nor
tools
are
wanting
now
after
having
been
brickmakers
potters
smelters
and
smiths
we
shall
surely
know
how
to
be
masons
yes
my
friend
but
before
coming
to
any
decision
we
must
consider
the
matter
thoroughly
a
natural
dwelling
would
spare
us
much
work
and
would
be
a
surer
retreat
for
it
would
be
as
well
defended
against
enemies
from
the
interior
as
those
from
outside
that
is
true
cyrus
replied
the
reporter
but
we
have
already
examined
all
that
mass
of
granite
and
there
is
not
a
hole
not
a
cranny
no
not
one
added
pencroft
ah
if
we
were
able
to
dig
out
a
dwelling
in
that
cliff
at
a
good
height
so
as
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
harm
that
would
be
capital
i
can
see
that
on
the
front
which
looks
seaward
five
or
six
rooms
with
windows
to
light
them
said
herbert
laughing
and
a
staircase
to
climb
up
to
them
added
neb
you
are
laughing
cried
the
sailor
and
why
what
is
there
impossible
in
what
i
propose
havent
we
got
pickaxes
and
spades
wont

blow
up
the

isnt
it
true
captain
that
you
will
make
powder
the
very
day
we
want
it
cyrus
harding
listened
to
the
enthusiastic
pencroft
developing
his
fanciful
projects
to
attack
this
mass
of
granite
even
by
a
mine
was
herculean
work
and
it
was
really
vexing
that
nature
could
not
help
them
at
their
need
but
the
engineer
did
not
reply
to
the
sailor
except
by
proposing
to
examine
the
cliff
more
attentively
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
to
the
angle
which
terminated
it
on
the
north
they
went
out
therefore
and
the
exploration
was
made
with
extreme
care
over
an
extent
of
nearly
two
miles
but
in
no
place
in
the
bare
straight
cliff
could
any
cavity
be
found
the
nests
of
the
rock
pigeons
which
fluttered
at
its
summit
were
only
in
reality
holes
bored
at
the
very
top
and
on
the
irregular
edge
of
the
granite
it
was
a
provoking
circumstance
and
as
to
attacking
this
cliff
either
with
pickaxe
or
with
powder
so
as
to
effect
a
sufficient
excavation
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
it
so
happened
that
on
all
this
part
of
the
shore
pencroft
had
discovered
the
only
habitable
shelter
that
is
to
say
the
chimneys
which
now
had
to
be
abandoned
the
exploration
ended
the
colonists
found
themselves
at
the
north
angle
of
the
cliff
where
it
terminated
in
long
slopes
which
died
away
on
the
shore
from
this
place
to
its
extreme
limit
in
the
west
it
only
formed
a
sort
of
declivity
a
thick
mass
of
stones
earth
and
sand
bound
together
by
plants
bushes
and
grass
inclined
at
an
angle
of
only
fortyfive
degrees
clumps
of
trees
grew
on
these
slopes
which
were
also
carpeted
with
thick
grass
but
the
vegetation
did
not
extend
far
and
a
long
sandy
plain
which
began
at
the
foot
of
these
slopes
reached
to
the
beach
cyrus
harding
thought
not
without
reason
that
the
overplus
of
the
lake
must
overflow
on
this
side
the
excess
of
water
furnished
by
the
red
creek
must
also
escape
by
some
channel
or
other
now
the
engineer
had
not
yet
found
this
channel
on
any
part
of
the
shore
already
explored
that
is
to
say
from
the
mouth
of
the
stream
on
the
west
of
prospect
heights
the
engineer
now
proposed
to
his
companions
to
climb
the
slope
and
to
return
to
the
chimneys
by
the
heights
while
exploring
the
northern
and
eastern
shores
of
the
lake
the
proposal
was
accepted
and
in
a
few
minutes
herbert
and
neb
were
on
the
upper
plateau
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
and
pencroft
followed
with
more
sedate
steps
the
beautiful
sheet
of
water
glittered
through
the
trees
under
the
rays
of
the
sun
in
this
direction
the
country
was
charming
the
eye
feasted
on
the
groups
of
trees
some
old
trunks
bent
with
age
showed
black
against
the
verdant
grass
which
covered
the
ground
crowds
of
brilliant
cockatoos
screamed
among
the
branches
moving
prisms
hopping
from
one
bough
to
another
the
settlers
instead
of
going
directly
to
the
north
bank
of
the
lake
made
a
circuit
round
the
edge
of
the
plateau
so
as
to
join
the
mouth
of
the
creek
on
its
left
bank
it
was
a
detour
of
more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
walking
was
easy
for
the
trees
widely
spread
left
a
considerable
space
between
them
the
fertile
zone
evidently
stopped
at
this
point
and
vegetation
would
be
less
vigorous
in
the
part
between
the
course
of
the
creek
and
the
mercy
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
walked
over
this
new
ground
with
great
care
bows
arrows
and
sticks
with
sharp
iron
points
were
their
only
weapons
however
no
wild
beast
showed
itself
and
it
was
probable
that
these
animals
frequented
rather
the
thick
forests
in
the
south
but
the
settlers
had
the
disagreeable
surprise
of
seeing
top
stop
before
a
snake
of
great
size
measuring
from
fourteen
to
fifteen
feet
in
length
neb
killed
it
by
a
blow
from
his
stick
cyrus
harding
examined
the
reptile
and
declared
it
not
venomous
for
it
belonged
to
that
species
of
diamond
serpents
which
the
natives
of
new
south
wales
rear
but
it
was
possible
that
others
existed
whose
bite
was
mortal
such
as
the
deaf
vipers
with
forked
tails
which
rise
up
under
the
feet
or
those
winged
snakes
furnished
with
two
ears
which
enable
them
to
proceed
with
great
rapidity
top
the
first
moment
of
surprise
over
began
a
reptile
chase
with
such
eagerness
that
they
feared
for
his
safety
his
master
called
him
back
directly
the
mouth
of
the
red
creek
at
the
place
where
it
entered
into
the
lake
was
soon
reached
the
explorers
recognized
on
the
opposite
shore
the
point
which
they
had
visited
on
their
descent
from
mount
franklin
cyrus
harding
ascertained
that
the
flow
of
water
into
it
from
the
creek
was
considerable
nature
must
therefore
have
provided
some
place
for
the
escape
of
the
overplus
this
doubtless
formed
a
fall
which
if
it
could
be
discovered
would
be
of
great
use
the
colonists
walking
apart
but
not
straying
far
from
each
other
began
to
skirt
the
edge
of
the
lake
which
was
very
steep
the
water
appeared
to
be
full
of
fish
and
pencroft
resolved
to
make
some
fishingrods
so
as
to
try
and
catch
some
the
northeast
point
was
first
to
be
doubled
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
the
discharge
of
water
was
at
this
place
for
the
extremity
of
the
lake
was
almost
on
a
level
with
the
edge
of
the
plateau
but
no
signs
of
this
were
discovered
and
the
colonists
continued
to
explore
the
bank
which
after
a
slight
bend
descended
parallel
to
the
shore
on
this
side
the
banks
were
less
woody
but
clumps
of
trees
here
and
there
added
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
country
lake
grant
was
viewed
from
thence
in
all
its
extent
and
no
breath
disturbed
the
surface
of
its
waters
top
in
beating
the
bushes
put
up
flocks
of
birds
of
different
kinds
which
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
saluted
with
arrows
one
was
hit
by
the
lad
and
fell
into
some
marshy
grass
top
rushed
forward
and
brought
a
beautiful
swimming
bird
of
a
slate
color
short
beak
very
developed
frontal
plate
and
wings
edged
with
white
it
was
a
coot
the
size
of
a
large
partridge
belonging
to
the
group
of
macrodactyls
which
form
the
transition
between
the
order
of
wading
birds
and
that
of
palmipeds
sorry
game
in
truth
and
its
flavor
is
far
from
pleasant
but
top
was
not
so
particular
in
these
things
as
his
masters
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
coot
should
be
for
his
supper
the
settlers
were
now
following
the
eastern
bank
of
the
lake
and
they
would
not
be
long
in
reaching
the
part
which
they
already
knew
the
engineer
was
much
surprised
at
not
seeing
any
indication
of
the
discharge
of
water
the
reporter
and
the
sailor
talked
with
him
and
he
could
not
conceal
his
astonishment
at
this
moment
top
who
had
been
very
quiet
till
then
gave
signs
of
agitation
the
intelligent
animal
went
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
shore
stopped
suddenly
and
looked
at
the
water
one
paw
raised
as
if
he
was
pointing
at
some
invisible
game
then
he
barked
furiously
and
was
suddenly
silent
neither
cyrus
harding
nor
his
companions
had
at
first
paid
any
attention
to
tops
behavior
but
the
dogs
barking
soon
became
so
frequent
that
the
engineer
noticed
it
what
is
there
top
he
asked
the
dog
bounded
towards
his
master
seeming
to
be
very
uneasy
and
then
rushed
again
towards
the
bank
then
all
at
once
he
plunged
into
the
lake
here
top
cried
cyrus
harding
who
did
not
like
his
dog
to
venture
into
the
treacherous
water
whats
happening
down
there
asked
pencroft
examining
the
surface
of
the
lake
top
smells
some
amphibious
creature
replied
herbert
an
alligator
perhaps
said
the
reporter
i
do
not
think
so
replied
harding
alligators
are
only
met
with
in
regions
less
elevated
in
latitude
meanwhile
top
had
returned
at
his
masters
call
and
had
regained
the
shore
but
he
could
not
stay
quiet
he
plunged
in
among
the
tall
grass
and
guided
by
instinct
he
appeared
to
follow
some
invisible
being
which
was
slipping
along
under
the
surface
of
the
water
however
the
water
was
calm
not
a
ripple
disturbed
its
surface
several
times
the
settlers
stopped
on
the
bank
and
observed
it
attentively
nothing
appeared
there
was
some
mystery
there
the
engineer
was
puzzled
let
us
pursue
this
exploration
to
the
end
said
he
half
an
hour
after
they
had
all
arrived
at
the
southeast
angle
of
the
lake
on
prospect
heights
at
this
point
the
examination
of
the
banks
of
the
lake
was
considered
finished
and
yet
the
engineer
had
not
been
able
to
discover
how
and
where
the
waters
were
discharged
there
is
no
doubt
this
overflow
exists
he
repeated
and
since
it
is
not
visible
it
must
go
through
the
granite
cliff
at
the
west
but
what
importance
do
you
attach
to
knowing
that
my
dear
cyrus
asked
gideon
spilett
considerable
importance
replied
the
engineer
for
if
it
flows
through
the
cliff
there
is
probably
some
cavity
which
it
would
be
easy
to
render
habitable
after
turning
away
the
water
but
is
it
not
possible
captain
that
the
water
flows
away
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
said
herbert
and
that
it
reaches
the
sea
by
some
subterranean
passage
that
might
be
replied
the
engineer
and
should
it
be
so
we
shall
be
obliged
to
build
our
house
ourselves
since
nature
has
not
done
it
for
us
the
colonists
were
about
to
begin
to
traverse
the
plateau
to
return
to
the
chimneys
when
top
gave
new
signs
of
agitation
he
barked
with
fury
and
before
his
master
could
restrain
him
he
had
plunged
a
second
time
into
the
lake
all
ran
towards
the
bank
the
dog
was
already
more
than
twenty
feet
off
and
cyrus
was
calling
him
back
when
an
enormous
head
emerged
from
the
water
which
did
not
appear
to
be
deep
in
that
place
herbert
recognized
directly
the
species
of
amphibian
to
which
the
tapering
head
with
large
eyes
and
adorned
with
long
silky
mustaches
belonged
a
lamantin
he
cried
it
was
not
a
lamantin
but
one
of
that
species
of
the
order
of
cetaceans
which
bear
the
name
of
the
dugong
for
its
nostrils
were
open
at
the
upper
part
of
its
snout
the
enormous
animal
rushed
on
the
dog
who
tried
to
escape
by
returning
towards
the
shore
his
master
could
do
nothing
to
save
him
and
before
gideon
spilett
or
herbert
thought
of
bending
their
bows
top
seized
by
the
dugong
had
disappeared
beneath
the
water
neb
his
irontipped
spear
in
his
hand
wished
to
go
to
tops
help
and
attack
the
dangerous
animal
in
its
own
element
no
neb
said
the
engineer
restraining
his
courageous
servant
meanwhile
a
struggle
was
going
on
beneath
the
water
an
inexplicable
struggle
for
in
his
situation
top
could
not
possibly
resist
and
judging
by
the
bubbling
of
the
surface
it
must
be
also
a
terrible
struggle
and
could
not
but
terminate
in
the
death
of
the
dog
but
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
foaming
circle
top
reappeared
thrown
in
the
air
by
some
unknown
power
he
rose
ten
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
lake
fell
again
into
the
midst
of
the
agitated
waters
and
then
soon
gained
the
shore
without
any
severe
wounds
miraculously
saved
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
could
not
understand
it
what
was
not
less
inexplicable
was
that
the
struggle
still
appeared
to
be
going
on
doubtless
the
dugong
attacked
by
some
powerful
animal
after
having
released
the
dog
was
fighting
on
its
own
account
but
it
did
not
last
long
the
water
became
red
with
blood
and
the
body
of
the
dugong
emerging
from
the
sheet
of
scarlet
which
spread
around
soon
stranded
on
a
little
beach
at
the
south
angle
of
the
lake
the
colonists
ran
towards
it
the
dugong
was

it
was
an
enormous
animal
fifteen
or
sixteen
feet
long
and
must
have
weighed
from
three
to
four
thousand
pounds
at
its
neck
was
a
wound
which
appeared
to
have
been

by
a
sharp
blade

the
amphibious
creature
have
been

by
this
terrible
blow
had
destroyed

the
next
day
the
7th
of
may
harding
and
gideon
spilett
leaving
neb
to
prepare
breakfast
climbed
prospect
heights
while
herbert
and
pencroft
ascended
by
the
river
to
renew
their
store
of
wood
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
soon
reached
the
little
beach
on
which
the
dugong
had
been
stranded
already
flocks
of
birds
had
attacked
the
mass
of
flesh
and
had
to
be
driven
away
with
stones
for
cyrus
wished
to
keep
the
fat
for
the
use
of
the
colony
as
to
the
animals
flesh
it
would
furnish
excellent
food
for
in
the
islands
of
the
malay
archipelago
and
elsewhere
it
is
especially
reserved
for
the
table
of
the
native
princes
but
that
was
nebs
affair
at
this
moment
cyrus
harding
had
other
thoughts
he
was
much
interested
in
the
incident
of
the
day
before
he
wished
to
penetrate
the
mystery
of
that
submarine
combat
and
to
ascertain
what
monster
could
have
given
the
dugong
so
strange
a
wound
he
remained
at
the
edge
of
the
lake
looking
observing
but
nothing
appeared
under
the
tranquil
waters
which
sparkled
in
the
first
rays
of
the
rising
sun
at
the
beach
on
which
lay
the
body
of
the
dugong
the
water
was
tolerably
shallow
but
from
this
point
the
bottom
of
the
lake
sloped
gradually
and
it
was
probable
that
the
depth
was
considerable
in
the
center
the
lake
might
be
considered
as
a
large
center
basin
which
was
filled
by
the
water
from
the
red
creek
well
cyrus
said
the
reporter
there
seems
to
be
nothing
suspicious
in
this
water
no
my
dear
spilett
replied
the
engineer
and
i
really
do
not
know
how
to
account
for
the
incident
of
yesterday
i
acknowledge
returned
spilett
that
the
wound
given
this
creature
is
at
least
very
strange
and
i
cannot
explain
either
how
top
was
so
vigorously
cast
up
out
of
the
water
one
could
have
thought
that
a
powerful
arm
hurled
him
up
and
that
the
same
arm
with
a
dagger
killed
the
dugong
yes
replied
the
engineer
who
had
become
thoughtful
there
is
something
there
that
i
cannot
understand
but
do
you
better
understand
either
my
dear
spilett
in
what
way
i
was
saved
myselfhow
i
was
drawn
from
the
waves
and
carried
to
the
downs
no
is
it
not
true
now
i
feel
sure
that
there
is
some
mystery
there
which
doubtless
we
shall
discover
some
day
let
us
observe
but
do
not
dwell
on
these
singular
incidents
before
our
companions
let
us
keep
our
remarks
to
ourselves
and
continue
our
work
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
engineer
had
not
as
yet
been
able
to
discover
the
place
where
the
surplus
water
escaped
but
he
knew
it
must
exist
somewhere
he
was
much
surprised
to
see
a
strong
current
at
this
place
by
throwing
in
some
bits
of
wood
he
found
that
it
set
towards
the
southern
angle
he
followed
the
current
and
arrived
at
the
south
point
of
the
lake
there
was
there
a
sort
of
depression
in
the
water
as
if
it
was
suddenly
lost
in
some
fissure
in
the
ground
harding
listened
placing
his
ear
to
the
level
of
the
lake
he
very
distinctly
heard
the
noise
of
a
subterranean
fall
there
said
he
rising
is
the
discharge
of
the
water
there
doubtless
by
a
passage
in
the
granite
cliff
it
joins
the
sea
through
cavities
which
we
can
use
to
our
profit
well
i
can
find
it
the
engineer
cut
a
long
branch
stripped
it
of
its
leaves
and
plunging
it
into
the
angle
between
the
two
banks
he
found
that
there
was
a
large
hole
one
foot
only
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
this
hole
was
the
opening
so
long
looked
for
in
vain
and
the
force
of
the
current
was
such
that
the
branch
was
torn
from
the
engineers
hands
and
disappeared
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
now
repeated
harding
there
is
the
outlet
and
i
will
lay
it
open
to
view
how
asked
gideon
spilett
by
lowering
the
level
of
the
water
of
the
lake
three
feet
and
how
will
you
lower
the
level
by
opening
another
outlet
larger
than
this
at
what
place
cyrus
at
the
part
of
the
bank
nearest
the
coast
but
it
is
a
mass
of
granite
observed
spilett
well
replied
cyrus
harding
i
will
blow
up
the
granite
and
the
water
escaping
will
subside
so
as
to
lay
bare
this
opening
and
make
a
waterfall
by
falling
on
to
the
beach
added
the
reporter
a
fall
that
we
shall
make
use
of
replied
cyrus
come
come
the
engineer
hurried
away
his
companion
whose
confidence
in
harding
was
such
that
he
did
not
doubt
the
enterprise
would
succeed
and
yet
how
was
this
granite
wall
to
be
opened
without
powder
and
with
imperfect
instruments
was
not
this
work
upon
which
the
engineer
was
so
bent
above
their
strength
when
harding
and
the
reporter
entered
the
chimneys
they
found
herbert
and
pencroft
unloading
their
raft
of
wood
the
woodmen
have
just
finished
captain
said
the
sailor
laughing
and
when
you
want
masons
masonsno
but
chemists
replied
the
engineer
yes
added
the
reporter
we
are
going
to
blow
up
the
island
blow
up
the
island
cried
pencroft
part
of
it
at
least
replied
spilett
listen
to
me
my
friends
said
the
engineer
and
he
made
known
to
them
the
result
of
his
observations
according
to
him
a
cavity
more
or
less
considerable
must
exist
in
the
mass
of
granite
which
supported
prospect
heights
and
he
intended
to
penetrate
into
it
to
do
this
the
opening
through
which
the
water
rushed
must
first
be
cleared
and
the
level
lowered
by
making
a
larger
outlet
therefore
an
explosive
substance
must
be
manufactured
which
would
make
a
deep
trench
in
some
other
part
of
the
shore
this
was
what
harding
was
going
to
attempt
with
the
minerals
which
nature
placed
at
his
disposal
it
is
useless
to
say
with
what
enthusiasm
all
especially
pencroft
received
this
project
to
employ
great
means
open
the
granite
create
a
cascade
that
suited
the
sailor
and
he
would
just
as
soon
be
a
chemist
as
a
mason
or
bootmaker
since
the
engineer
wanted
chemicals
he
would
be
all
that
they
liked
even
a
professor
of
dancing
and
deportment
said
he
to
neb
if
that
was
ever
necessary
neb
and
pencroft
were
first
of
all
told
to
extract
the
grease
from
the
dugong
and
to
keep
the
flesh
which
was
destined
for
food
such
perfect
confidence
had
they
in
the
engineer
that
they
set
out
directly
without
even
asking
a
question
a
few
minutes
after
them
cyrus
harding
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
dragging
the
hurdle
went
towards
the
vein
of
coals
where
those
shistose
pyrites
abound
which
are
met
with
in
the
most
recent
transition
soil
and
of
which
harding
had
already
found
a
specimen
all
the
day
being
employed
in
carrying
a
quantity
of
these
stones
to
the
chimneys
by
evening
they
had
several
tons
the
next
day
the
8th
of
may
the
engineer
began
his
manipulations
these
shistose
pyrites
being
composed
principally
of
coal
flint
alumina
and
sulphuret
of
ironthe
latter
in
excessit
was
necessary
to
separate
the
sulphuret
of
iron
and
transform
it
into
sulphate
as
rapidly
as
possible
the
sulphate
obtained
the
sulphuric
acid
could
then
be
extracted
this
was
the
object
to
be
attained
sulphuric
acid
is
one
of
the
agents
the
most
frequently
employed
and
the
manufacturing
importance
of
a
nation
can
be
measured
by
the
consumption
which
is
made
of
it
this
acid
would
later
be
of
great
use
to
the
settlers
in
the
manufacturing
of
candles
tanning
skins
etc
but
this
time
the
engineer
reserved
it
for
another
use
cyrus
harding
chose
behind
the
chimneys
a
site
where
the
ground
was
perfectly
level
on
this
ground
he
placed
a
layer
of
branches
and
chopped
wood
on
which
were
piled
some
pieces
of
shistose
pyrites
buttressed
one
against
the
other
the
whole
being
covered
with
a
thin
layer
of
pyrites
previously
reduced
to
the
size
of
a
nut
this
done
they
set
fire
to
the
wood
the
heat
was
communicated
to
the
shist
which
soon
kindled
since
it
contains
coal
and
sulphur
then
new
layers
of
bruised
pyrites
were
arranged
so
as
to
form
an
immense
heap
the
exterior
of
which
was
covered
with
earth
and
grass
several
airholes
being
left
as
if
it
was
a
stack
of
wood
which
was
to
be
carbonized
to
make
charcoal
they
then
left
the
transformation
to
complete
itself
and
it
would
not
take
less
than
ten
or
twelve
days
for
the
sulphuret
of
iron
to
be
changed
to
sulphate
of
iron
and
the
alumina
into
sulphate
of
alumina
two
equally
soluble
substances
the
others
flint
burnt
coal
and
cinders
not
being
so
while
this
chemical
work
was
going
on
cyrus
harding
proceeded
with
other
operations
which
were
pursued
with
more
than
zealit
was
eagerness
neb
and
pencroft
had
taken
away
the
fat
from
the
dugong
and
placed
it
in
large
earthen
pots
it
was
then
necessary
to
separate
the
glycerine
from
the
fat
by
saponifying
it
now
to
obtain
this
result
it
had
to
be
treated
either
with
soda
or
lime
in
fact
one
or
other
of
these
substances
after
having
attacked
the
fat
would
form
a
soap
by
separating
the
glycerine
and
it
was
just
this
glycerine
which
the
engineer
wished
to
obtain
there
was
no
want
of
lime
only
treatment
by
lime
would
give
calcareous
soap
insoluble
and
consequently
useless
while
treatment
by
soda
would
furnish
on
the
contrary
a
soluble
soap
which
could
be
put
to
domestic
use
now
a
practical
man
like
cyrus
harding
would
rather
try
to
obtain
soda
was
this
difficult
no
for
marine
plants
abounded
on
the
shore
glasswort
ficoides
and
all
those
fucaceae
which
form
wrack
a
large
quantity
of
these
plants
was
collected
first
dried
then
burnt
in
holes
in
the
open
air
the
combustion
of
these
plants
was
kept
up
for
several
days
and
the
result
was
a
compact
gray
mass
which
has
been
long
known
under
the
name
of
natural
soda
this
obtained
the
engineer
treated
the
fat
with
soda
which
gave
both
a
soluble
soap
and
that
neutral
substance
glycerine
but
this
was
not
all
cyrus
harding
still
needed
in
view
of
his
future
preparation
another
substance
nitrate
of
potash
which
is
better
known
under
the
name
of
salt
niter
or
of
saltpeter
cyrus
harding
could
have
manufactured
this
substance
by
treating
the
carbonate
of
potash
which
would
be
easily
extracted
from
the
cinders
of
the
vegetables
by
azotic
acid
but
this
acid
was
wanting
and
he
would
have
been
in
some
difficulty
if
nature
had
not
happily
furnished
the
saltpeter
without
giving
them
any
other
trouble
than
that
of
picking
it
up
herbert
found
a
vein
of
it
at
the
foot
of
mount
franklin
and
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
purify
this
salt
these
different
works
lasted
a
week
they
were
finished
before
the
transformation
of
the
sulphuret
into
sulphate
of
iron
had
been
accomplished
during
the
following
days
the
settlers
had
time
to
construct
a
furnace
of
bricks
of
a
particular
arrangement
to
serve
for
the
distillation
of
the
sulphate
or
iron
when
it
had
been
obtained
all
this
was
finished
about
the
18th
of
may
nearly
at
the
time
when
the
chemical
transformation
terminated
gideon
spilett
herbert
neb
and
pencroft
skillfully
directed
by
the
engineer
had
become
most
clever
workmen
before
all
masters
necessity
is
the
one
most
listened
to
and
who
teaches
the
best
when
the
heap
of
pyrites
had
been
entirely
reduced
by
fire
the
result
of
the
operation
consisting
of
sulphate

sulphate
of

of
coal
and
cinders
was
placed
in
a
basinful
of
water
they
stirred
this
mixture
let
it
settle
then
decanted
it
and
obtained
a
clear
liquid
containing
in
solution
sulphate
of
iron
and
sulphate
of
alumina
the
other
matters
remaining
solid
since
they
are
insoluble
lastly
this
liquid
being
partly
evaporated
crystals
of
sulphate
of
iron
were
deposited
and
the
not
evaporated
liquid
which
contained
the
sulphate

was
thrown
away
cyrus
harding
had
now
at
his
disposal
a
large
quantity
of
these
sulphate
of
iron
crystals
from
which
the
sulphuric
acid
had
to
be
extracted
the
making
of
sulphuric
acid
is
a
very
expensive
manufacture
considerable
works
are
necessarya
special
set
of
tools
an
apparatus
of
platina
leaden
chambers
unassailable
by
the
acid
and
in
which
the
transformation
is
performed
etc
the
engineer
had
none
of
these
at
his
disposal
but
he
knew
that
in
bohemia
especially
sulphuric
acid
is
manufactured
by
very
simple
means
which
have
also
the
advantage
of
producing
it
to
a
superior
degree
of
concentration
it
is
thus
that
the
acid
known
under
the
name
of
nordhausen
acid
is
made
to
obtain
sulphuric
acid
cyrus
harding
had
only
one
operation
to
make
to
calcine
the
sulphate
of
iron
crystals
in
a
closed
vase
so
that
the
sulphuric
acid
should
distil
in
vapor
which
vapor
by
condensation
would
produce
the
acid
the
crystals
were
placed
in
pots
and
the
heat
from
the
furnace
would
distil
the
sulphuric
acid
the
operation
was
successfully
completed
and
on
the
20th
of
may
twelve
days
after
commencing
it
the
engineer
was
the
possessor
of
the
agent
which
later
he
hoped
to
use
in
so
many
different
ways
now
why
did
he
wish
for
this
agent
simply
to
produce
azotic
acid
and
that
was
easy
since
saltpeter
attacked
by
sulphuric
acid
gives
azotic
or
nitric
acid
by
distillation
but
after
all
how
was
he
going
to
employ
this
azotic
acid
his
companions
were
still
ignorant
of
this
for
he
had
not
informed
them
of
the
result
at
which
he
aimed
however
the
engineer
had
nearly
accomplished
his
purpose
and
by
a
last
operation
he
would
procure
the
substance
which
had
given
so
much
trouble
taking
some
azotic
acid
he
mixed
it
with
glycerine
which
had
been
previously
concentrated
by
evaporation
subjected
to
the
waterbath
and
he
obtained
without
even
employing
a
refrigerant
mixture
several
pints
of
an
oily
yellow
mixture
this
last
operation
cyrus
harding
had
made
alone
in
a
retired
place
at
a
distance
from
the
chimneys
for
he
feared
the
danger
of
an
explosion
and
when
he
showed
a
bottle
of
this
liquid
to
his
friends
he
contented
himself
with
saying
here
is
nitroglycerine
it
was
really
this
terrible
production
of
which
the
explosive
power
is
perhaps
tenfold
that
of
ordinary
powder
and
which
has
already
caused
so
many
accidents
however
since
a
way
has
been
found
to
transform
it
into
dynamite
that
is
to
say
to
mix
with
it
some
solid
substance
clay
or
sugar
porous
enough
to
hold
it
the
dangerous
liquid
has
been
used
with
some
security
but
dynamite
was
not
yet
known
at
the
time
when
the
settlers
worked
on
lincoln
island
and
is
it
that
liquid
that
is
going
to
blow
up
our
rocks
said
pencroft
incredulously
yes
my
friend
replied
the
engineer
and
this
nitroglycerine
will
produce
so
much
the
more
effect
as
the
granite
is
extremely
hard
and
will
oppose
a
greater
resistance
to
the
explosion
and
when
shall
we
see
this
captain
tomorrow
as
soon
as
we
have
dug
a
hole
for
the
mine
replied
the
engineer
the
next
day
the
21st
of
may
at
daybreak
the
miners
went
to
the
point
which
formed
the
eastern
shore
of
lake
grant
and
was
only
five
hundred
feet
from
the
coast
at
this
place
the
plateau
inclined
downwards
from
the
waters
which
were
only
restrained
by
their
granite
case
therefore
if
this
case
was
broken
the
water
would
escape
by
the
opening
and
form
a
stream
which
flowing
over
the
inclined
surface
of
the
plateau
would
rush
on
to
the
beach
consequently
the
level
of
the
lake
would
be
greatly
lowered
and
the
opening
where
the
water
escaped
would
be
exposed
which
was
their
final
aim
under
the
engineers
directions
pencroft
armed
with
a
pickaxe
which
he
handled
skillfully
and
vigorously
attacked
the
granite
the
hole
was
made
on
the
point
of
the
shore
slanting
so
that
it
should
meet
a
much
lower
level
than
that
of
the
water
of
the
lake
in
this
way
the
explosive
force
by
scattering
the
rock
would
open
a
large
place
for
the
water
to
rush
out
the
work
took
some
time
for
the
engineer
wishing
to
produce
a
great
effect
intended
to
devote
not
less
than
seven
quarts
of
nitroglycerine
to
the
operation
but
pencroft
relieved
by
neb
did
so
well
that
towards
four
oclock
in
the
evening
the
mine
was
finished
now
the
question
of
setting
fire
to
the
explosive
substance
was
raised
generally
nitroglycerine
is
ignited
by
caps
of
fulminate
which
in
bursting
cause
the
explosion
a
shock
is
therefore
needed
to
produce
the
explosion
for
simply
lighted
this
substance
would
burn
without
exploding
cyrus
harding
could
certainly
have
fabricated
a
percussion
cap
in
default
of
fulminate
he
could
easily
obtain
a
substance
similar
to
guncotton
since
he
had
azotic
acid
at
his
disposal
this
substance
pressed
in
a
cartridge
and
introduced
among
the
nitroglycerine
would
burst
by
means
of
a
fuse
and
cause
the
explosion
but
cyrus
harding
knew
that
nitroglycerine
would
explode
by
a
shock
he
resolved
to
employ
this
means
and
try
another
way
if
this
did
not
succeed
in
fact
the
blow
of
a
hammer
on
a
few
drops
of
nitroglycerine
spread
out
on
a
hard
surface
was
enough
to
create
an
explosion
but
the
operator
could
not
be
there
to
give
the
blow
without
becoming
a
victim
to
the
operation
harding
therefore
thought
of
suspending
a
mass
of
iron
weighing
several
pounds
by
means
of
a
fiber
to
an
upright
just
above
the
mine
another
long
fiber
previously
impregnated
with
sulphur
was
attached
to
the
middle
of
the
first
by
one
end
while
the
other
lay
on
the
ground
several
feet
distant
from
the
mine
the
second
fiber
being
set
on
fire
it
would
burn
till
it
reached
the
first
this
catching
fire
in
its
turn
would
break
and
the
mass
of
iron
would
fall
on
the
nitroglycerine
this
apparatus
being
then
arranged
the
engineer
after
having
sent
his
companions
to
a
distance
filled
the
hole
so
that
the
nitroglycerine
was
on
a
level
with
the
opening
then
he
threw
a
few
drops
of
it
on
the
surface
of
the
rock
above
which
the
mass
of
iron
was
already
suspended
this
done
harding
lit
the
end
of
the
sulphured
fiber
and
leaving
the
place
he
returned
with
his
companions
to
the
chimneys
the
fiber
was
intended
to
burn
five
and
twenty
minutes
and
in
fact
five
and
twenty
minutes
afterwards
a
most
tremendous
explosion
was
heard
the
island
appeared
to
tremble
to
its
very
foundation
stones
were
projected
in
the
air
as
if
by
the
eruption
of
a
volcano
the
shock
produced
by
the
displacing
of
the
air
was
such
that
the
rocks
of
the
chimneys
shook
the
settlers
although
they
were
more
than
two
miles
from
the
mine
were
thrown
on
the
ground
they
rose
climbed
the
plateau
and
ran
towards
the
place
where
the
bank
of
the
lake
must
have
been
shattered
by
the
explosion
a
cheer
escaped
them
a
large
rent
was
seen
in
the
granite
a
rapid
stream
of
water
rushed
foaming
across
the
plateau
and
dashed
down
a
height
of
three
hundred
feet
on
to
the

according

with
joy
pencroft
nodded
his
great
head
murmuring
these
words
come
our
engineer
gets
on
capitally
the
nitroglycerine
had
indeed
acted
powerfully
the
opening
which
it
had
made
was
so
large
that
the
volume
of
water
which
escaped
through
this
new
outlet
was
at
least
treble
that
which
before
passed
through
the
old
one
the
result
was
that
a
short
time
after
the
operation
the
level
of
the
lake
would
be
lowered
two
feet
or
more
the
settlers
went
to
the
chimneys
to
take
some
pickaxes
irontipped
spears
string
made
of
fibers
flint
and
steel
they
then
returned
to
the
plateau
top
accompanying
them
on
the
way
the
sailor
could
not
help
saying
to
the
engineer
dont
you
think
captain
that
by
means
of
that
charming
liquid
you
have
made
one
could
blow
up
the
whole
of
our
island
without
any
doubt
the
island
continents
and
the
world
itself
replied
the
engineer
it
is
only
a
question
of
quantity
then
could
you
not
use
this
nitroglycerine
for
loading
firearms
asked
the
sailor
no
pencroft
for
it
is
too
explosive
a
substance
but
it
would
be
easy
to
make
some
guncotton
or
even
ordinary
powder
as
we
have
azotic
acid
saltpeter
sulphur
and
coal
unhappily
it
is
the
guns
which
we
have
not
got
oh
captain
replied
the
sailor
with
a
little
determination
pencroft
had
erased
the
word
impossible
from
the
dictionary
of
lincoln
island
the
settlers
having
arrived
at
prospect
heights
went
immediately
towards
that
point
of
the
lake
near
which
was
the
old
opening
now
uncovered
this
outlet
had
now
become
practicable
since
the
water
no
longer
rushed
through
it
and
it
would
doubtless
be
easy
to
explore
the
interior
in
a
few
minutes
the
settlers
had
reached
the
lower
point
of
the
lake
and
a
glance
showed
them
that
the
object
had
been
attained
in
fact
in
the
side
of
the
lake
and
now
above
the
surface
of
the
water
appeared
the
longlookedfor
opening
a
narrow
ridge
left
bare
by
the
retreat
of
the
water
allowed
them
to
approach
it
this
orifice
was
nearly
twenty
feet
in
width
but
scarcely
two
in
height
it
was
like
the
mouth
of
a
drain
at
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
therefore
did
not
offer
an
easy
passage
to
the
settlers
but
neb
and
pencroft
taking
their
pickaxes
soon
made
it
of
a
suitable
height
the
engineer
then
approached
and
found
that
the
sides
of
the
opening
in
its
upper
part
at
least
had
not
a
slope
of
more
than
from
thirty
to
thirtyfive
degrees
it
was
therefore
practicable
and
provided
that
the
declivity
did
not
increase
it
would
be
easy
to
descend
even
to
the
level
of
the
sea
if
then
as
was
probable
some
vast
cavity
existed
in
the
interior
of
the
granite
it
might
perhaps
be
of
great
use
well
captain
what
are
we
stopping
for
asked
the
sailor
impatient
to
enter
the
narrow
passage
you
see
top
has
got
before
us
very
well
replied
the
engineer
but
we
must
see
our
way
neb
go
and
cut
some
resinous
branches
neb
and
herbert
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
shaded
with
pines
and
other
green
trees
and
soon
returned
with
some
branches
which
they
made
into
torches
the
torches
were
lighted
with
flint
and
steel
and
cyrus
harding
leading
the
settlers
ventured
into
the
dark
passage
which
the
overplus
of
the
lake
had
formerly
filled
contrary
to
what
might
have
been
supposed
the
diameter
of
the
passage
increased
as
the
explorers
proceeded
so
that
they
very
soon
were
able
to
stand
upright
the
granite
worn
by
the
water
for
an
infinite
time
was
very
slippery
and
falls
were
to
be
dreaded
but
the
settlers
were
all
attached
to
each
other
by
a
cord
as
is
frequently
done
in
ascending
mountains
happily
some
projections
of
the
granite
forming
regular
steps
made
the
descent
less
perilous
drops
still
hanging
from
the
rocks
shone
here
and
there
under
the
light
of
the
torches
and
the
explorers
guessed
that
the
sides
were
clothed
with
innumerable
stalactites
the
engineer
examined
this
black
granite
there
was
not
a
stratum
not
a
break
in
it
the
mass
was
compact
and
of
an
extremely
close
grain
the
passage
dated
then
from
the
very
origin
of
the
island
it
was
not
the
water
which
little
by
little
had
hollowed
it
pluto
and
not
neptune
had
bored
it
with
his
own
hand
and
on
the
wall
traces
of
an
eruptive
work
could
be
distinguished
which
all
the
washing
of
the
water
had
not
been
able
totally
to
efface
the
settlers
descended
very
slowly
they
could
not
but
feel
a
certain
awe
in
this
venturing
into
these
unknown
depths
for
the
first
time
visited
by
human
beings
they
did
not
speak
but
they
thought
and
the
thought
came
to
more
than
one
that
some
polypus
or
other
gigantic
cephalopod
might
inhabit
the
interior
cavities
which
were
in
communication
with
the
sea
however
top
kept
at
the
head
of
the
little
band
and
they
could
rely
on
the
sagacity
of
the
dog
who
would
not
fail
to
give
the
alarm
if
there
was
any
need
for
it
after
having
descended
about
a
hundred
feet
following
a
winding
road
harding
who
was
walking
on
before
stopped
and
his
companions
came
up
with
him
the
place
where
they
had
halted
was
wider
so
as
to
form
a
cavern
of
moderate
dimensions
drops
of
water
fell
from
the
vault
but
that
did
not
prove
that
they
oozed
through
the
rock
they
were
simply
the
last
traces
left
by
the
torrent
which
had
so
long
thundered
through
this
cavity
and
the
air
there
was
pure
though
slightly
damp
but
producing
no
mephitic
exhalation
well
my
dear
cyrus
said
gideon
spilett
here
is
a
very
secure
retreat
well
hid
in
the
depths
of
the
rock
but
it
is
however
uninhabitable
why
uninhabitable
asked
the
sailor
because
it
is
too
small
and
too
dark
couldnt
we
enlarge
it
hollow
it
out
make
openings
to
let
in
light
and
air
replied
pencroft
who
now
thought
nothing
impossible
let
us
go
on
with
our
exploration
said
cyrus
harding
perhaps
lower
down
nature
will
have
spared
us
this
labor
we
have
only
gone
a
third
of
the
way
observed
herbert
nearly
a
third
replied
harding
for
we
have
descended
a
hundred
feet
from
the
opening
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
a
hundred
feet
farther
down
where
is
top
asked
neb
interrupting
his
master
they
searched
the
cavern
but
the
dog
was
not
there
most
likely
he
has
gone
on
said
pencroft
let
us
join
him
replied
harding
the
descent
was
continued
the
engineer
carefully
observed
all
the
deviations
of
the
passage
and
notwithstanding
so
many
detours
he
could
easily
have
given
an
account
of
its
general
direction
which
went
towards
the
sea
the
settlers
had
gone
some
fifty
feet
farther
when
their
attention
was
attracted
by
distant
sounds
which
came
up
from
the
depths
they
stopped
and
listened
these
sounds
carried
through
the
passage
as
through
an
acoustic
tube
came
clearly
to
the
ear
that
is
top
barking
cried
herbert
yes
replied
pencroft
and
our
brave
dog
is
barking
furiously
we
have
our
irontipped
spears
said
cyrus
harding
keep
on
your
guard
and
forward
it
is
becoming
more
and
more
interesting
murmured
gideon
spilett
in
the
sailors
ear
who
nodded
harding
and
his
companions
rushed
to
the
help
of
their
dog
tops
barking
became
more
and
more
perceptible
and
it
seemed
strangely
fierce
was
he
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
some
animal
whose
retreat
he
had
disturbed
without
thinking
of
the
danger
to
which
they
might
be
exposed
the
explorers
were
now
impelled
by
an
irresistible
curiosity
and
in
a
few
minutes
sixteen
feet
lower
they
rejoined
top
there
the
passage
ended
in
a
vast
and
magnificent
cavern
top
was
running
backwards
and
forwards
barking
furiously
pencroft
and
neb
waving
their
torches
threw
the
light
into
every
crevice
and
at
the
same
time
harding
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
their
spears
raised
were
ready
for
any
emergency
which
might
arise
the
enormous
cavern
was
empty
the
settlers
explored
it
in
every
direction
there
was
nothing
there
not
an
animal
not
a
human
being
and
yet
top
continued
to
bark
neither
caresses
nor
threats
could
make
him
be
silent
there
must
be
a
place
somewhere
by
which
the
waters
of
the
lake
reached
the
sea
said
the
engineer
of
course
replied
pencroft
and
we
must
take
care
not
to
tumble
into
a
hole
go
top
go
cried
harding
the
dog
excited
by
his
masters
words
ran
towards
the
extremity
of
the
cavern
and
there
redoubled
his
barking
they
followed
him
and
by
the
light
of
the
torches
perceived
the
mouth
of
a
regular
well
in
the
granite
it
was
by
this
that
the
water
escaped
and
this
time
it
was
not
an
oblique
and
practicable
passage
but
a
perpendicular
well
into
which
it
was
impossible
to
venture
the
torches
were
held
over
the
opening
nothing
could
be
seen
harding
took
a
lighted
branch
and
threw
it
into
the
abyss
the
blazing
resin
whose
illuminating
power
increased
still
more
by
the
rapidity
of
its
fall
lighted
up
the
interior
of
the
well
but
yet
nothing
appeared
the
flame
then
went
out
with
a
slight
hiss
which
showed
that
it
had
reached
the
water
that
is
to
say
the
level
of
the
sea
the
engineer
calculating
the
time
employed
in
its
fall
was
able
to
calculate
the
depth
of
the
well
which
was
found
to
be
about
ninety
feet
the
floor
of
the
cavern
must
thus
be
situated
ninety
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
here
is
our
dwelling
said
cyrus
harding
but
it
was
occupied
by
some
creature
replied
gideon
spilett
whose
curiosity
was
not
yet
satisfied
well
the
creature
amphibious
or
otherwise
has
made
off
through
this
opening
replied
the
engineer
and
has
left
the
place
for
us
never
mind
added
the
sailor
i
should
like
very
much
to
be
top
just
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
he
doesnt
bark
for
nothing
cyrus
harding
looked
at
his
dog
and
those
of
his
companions
who
were
near
him
might
have
heard
him
murmur
these
words
yes
i
believe
that
top
knows
more
than
we
do
about
a
great
many
things
however
the
wishes
of
the
settlers
were
for
the
most
part
satisfied
chance
aided
by
the
marvelous
sagacity
of
their
leader
had
done
them
great
service
they
had
now
at
their
disposal
a
vast
cavern
the
size
of
which
could
not
be
properly
calculated
by
the
feeble
light
of
their
torches
but
it
would
certainly
be
easy
to
divide
it
into
rooms
by
means
of
brick
partitions
or
to
use
it
if
not
as
a
house
at
least
as
a
spacious
apartment
the
water
which
had
left
it
could
not
return
the
place
was
free
two
difficulties
remained
firstly
the
possibility
of
lighting
this
excavation
in
the
midst
of
solid
rock
secondly
the
necessity
of
rendering
the
means
of
access
more
easy
it
was
useless
to
think
of
lighting
it
from
above
because
of
the
enormous
thickness
of
the
granite
which
composed
the
ceiling
but
perhaps
the
outer
wall
next
the
sea
might
be
pierced
cyrus
harding
during
the
descent
had
roughly
calculated
its
obliqueness
and
consequently
the
length
of
the
passage
and
was
therefore
led
to
believe
that
the
outer
wall
could
not
be
very
thick
if
light
was
thus
obtained
so
would
a
means
of
access
for
it
would
be
as
easy
to
pierce
a
door
as
windows
and
to
establish
an
exterior
ladder
harding
made
known
his
ideas
to
his
companions
then
captain
let
us
set
to
work
replied
pencroft
i
have
my
pickaxe
and
i
shall
soon
make
my
way
through
this
wall
where
shall
i
strike
here
replied
the
engineer
showing
the
sturdy
sailor
a
considerable
recess
in
the
side
which
would
much
diminish
the
thickness
pencroft
attacked
the
granite
and
for
half
an
hour
by
the
light
of
the
torches
he
made
the
splinters
fly
around
him
neb
relieved
him
then
spilett
took
nebs
place
this
work
had
lasted
two
hours
and
they
began
to
fear
that
at
this
spot
the
wall
would
not
yield
to
the
pickaxe
when
at
a
last
blow
given
by
gideon
spilett
the
instrument
passing
through
the
rock
fell
outside
hurrah
hurrah
cried
pencroft
the
wall
only
measured
there
three
feet
in
thickness
harding
applied
his
eye
to
the
aperture
which
overlooked
the
ground
from
a
height
of
eighty
feet
before
him
was
extended
the
seacoast
the
islet
and
beyond
the
open
sea
floods
of
light
entered
by
this
hole
inundating
the
splendid
cavern
and
producing
a
magic
effect
on
its
left
side
it
did
not
measure
more
than
thirty
feet
in
height
and
breadth
but
on
the
right
it
was
enormous
and
its
vaulted
roof
rose
to
a
height
of
more
than
eighty
feet
in
some
places
granite
pillars
irregularly
disposed
supported
the
vaulted
roof
as
those
in
the
nave
of
a
cathedral
here
forming
lateral
piers
there
elliptical
arches
adorned
with
pointed
moldings
losing
themselves
in
dark
bays
amid
the
fantastic
arches
of
which
glimpses
could
be
caught
in
the
shade
covered
with
a
profusion
of
projections
formed
like
so
many
pendants
this
cavern
was
a
picturesque
mixture
of
all
the
styles
of
byzantine
roman
or
gothic
architecture
ever
produced
by
the
hand
of
man
and
yet
this
was
only
the
work
of
nature
she
alone
had
hollowed
this
fairy
alhambra
in
a
mass
of
granite
the
settlers
were
overwhelmed
with
admiration
where
they
had
only
expected
to
find
a
narrow
cavity
they
had
found
a
sort
of
marvelous
palace
and
neb
had
taken
off
his
hat
as
if
he
had
been
transported
into
a
temple
cries
of
admiration
issued
from
every
mouth
hurrahs
resounded
and
the
echo
was
repeated
again
and
again
till
it
died
away
in
the
dark
naves
ah
my
friends
exclaimed
cyrus
harding
when
we
have
lighted
the
interior
of
this
place
and
have
arranged
our
rooms
and
storehouses
in
the
left
part
we
shall
still
have
this
splendid
cavern
which
we
will
make
our
study
and
our
museum
and
we
will
call
it
asked
herbert
granite
house
replied
harding
a
name
which
his
companions
again
saluted
with
a
cheer
the
torches
were
now
almost
consumed
and
as
they
were
obliged
to
return
by
the
passage
to
reach
the
summit
of
the
plateau
it
was
decided
to
put
off
the
work
necessary
for
the
arrangement
of
their
new
dwelling
till
the
next
day
before
departing
cyrus
harding
leaned
once
more
over
the
dark
well
which
descended
perpendicularly
to
the
level
of
the
sea
he
listened
attentively
no
noise
was
heard
not
even
that
of
the
water
which
the
undulations
of
the
surge
must
sometimes
agitate
in
its
depths
a
flaming
branch
was
again
thrown
in
the
sides
of
the
well
were
lighted
up
for
an
instant
but
as
at
the
first
time
nothing
suspicious
was
seen
if
some
marine
monster
had
been
surprised
unawares
by
the
retreat
of
the
water
he
would
by
this
time
have
regained
the
sea
by
the
subterranean
passage
before
the
new
opening
had
been
offered
to
him
meanwhile
the
engineer
was
standing
motionless
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
gulf
without
uttering
a
word
the
sailor
approached
him
and
touching
his
arm
captain
said
he
what
do
you
want
my
friend
asked
the
engineer
as
if
he
had
returned
from
the
land
of
dreams
the
torches
will
soon
go
out
forward
replied
cyrus
harding
the
little
band
left
the
cavern
and
began
to
ascend
through
the
dark
passage
top
closed
the
rear
still
growling
every
now
and
then
the
ascent
was
painful
enough
the
settlers
rested
a
few
minutes
in
the
upper
grotto
which
made
a
sort
of
landingplace
halfway
up
the
long
granite
staircase
then
they
began
to
climb
again
soon
fresher
air
was
felt
the
drops
of
water
dried
by
evaporation
no
longer
sparkled
on
the
walls
the
flaring
torches
began
to
grow
dim
the
one
which
neb
carried
went
out
and
if
they
did
not
wish
to
find
their
way
in
the
dark
they
must
hasten
this
was
done
and
a
little
before
four
oclock
at
the
moment
when

cyrus
harding

his
companions
passed
out
of
the
passage
chapter
19
the
next
day
the
22nd
of
may
the
arrangement
of
their
new
dwelling
was
commenced
in
fact
the
settlers
longed
to
exchange
the
insufficient
shelter
of
the
chimneys
for
this
large
and
healthy
retreat
in
the
midst
of
solid
rock
and
sheltered
from
the
water
both
of
the
sea
and
sky
their
former
dwelling
was
not
however
to
be
entirely
abandoned
for
the
engineer
intended
to
make
a
manufactory
of
it
for
important
works
cyrus
hardings
first
care
was
to
find
out
the
position
of
the
front
of
granite
house
from
the
outside
he
went
to
the
beach
and
as
the
pickaxe
when
it
escaped
from
the
hands
of
the
reporter
must
have
fallen
perpendicularly
to
the
foot
of
the
cliff
the
finding
it
would
be
sufficient
to
show
the
place
where
the
hole
had
been
pierced
in
the
granite
the
pickaxe
was
easily
found
and
the
hole
could
be
seen
in
a
perpendicular
line
above
the
spot
where
it
was
stuck
in
the
sand
some
rock
pigeons
were
already
flying
in
and
out
of
the
narrow
opening
they
evidently
thought
that
granite
house
had
been
discovered
on
purpose
for
them
it
was
the
engineers
intention
to
divide
the
right
portion
of
the
cavern
into
several
rooms
preceded
by
an
entrance
passage
and
to
light
it
by
means
of
five
windows
and
a
door
pierced
in
the
front
pencroft
was
much
pleased
with
the
five
windows
but
he
could
not
understand
the
use
of
the
door
since
the
passage
offered
a
natural
staircase
through
which
it
would
always
be
easy
to
enter
granite
house
my
friend
replied
harding
if
it
is
easy
for
us
to
reach
our
dwelling
by
this
passage
it
will
be
equally
easy
for
others
besides
us
i
mean
on
the
contrary
to
block
up
that
opening
to
seal
it
hermetically
and
if
it
is
necessary
to
completely
hide
the
entrance
by
making
a
dam
and
thus
causing
the
water
of
the
lake
to
rise
and
how
shall
we
get
in
asked
the
sailor
by
an
outside
ladder
replied
cyrus
harding
a
rope
ladder
which
once
drawn
up
will
render
access
to
our
dwelling
impossible
but
why
so
many
precautions
asked
pencroft
as
yet
we
have
seen
no
dangerous
animals
as
to
our
island
being
inhabited
by
natives
i
dont
believe
it
are
you
quite
sure
of
that
pencroft
asked
the
engineer
looking
at
the
sailor
of
course
we
shall
not
be
quite
sure
till
we
have
explored
it
in
every
direction
replied
pencroft
yes
said
harding
for
we
know
only
a
small
portion
of
it
as
yet
but
at
any
rate
if
we
have
no
enemies
in
the
interior
they
may
come
from
the
exterior
for
parts
of
the
pacific
are
very
dangerous
we
must
be
provided
against
every
contingency
cyrus
harding
spoke
wisely
and
without
making
any
further
objection
pencroft
prepared
to
execute
his
orders
the
front
of
granite
house
was
then
to
be
lighted
by
five
windows
and
a
door
besides
a
large
bay
window
and
some
smaller
oval
ones
which
would
admit
plenty
of
light
to
enter
into
the
marvelous
nave
which
was
to
be
their
chief
room
this
facade
situated
at
a
height
of
eighty
feet
above
the
ground
was
exposed
to
the
east
and
the
rising
sun
saluted
it
with
its
first
rays
it
was
found
to
be
just
at
that
part
of
the
cliff
which
was
between
the
projection
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
and
a
perpendicular
line
traced
above
the
heap
of
rocks
which
formed
the
chimneys
thus
the
winds
from
the
northeast
would
only
strike
it
obliquely
for
it
was
protected
by
the
projection
besides
until
the
windowframes
were
made
the
engineer
meant
to
close
the
openings
with
thick
shutters
which
would
prevent
either
wind
or
rain
from
entering
and
which
could
be
concealed
in
need
the
first
work
was
to
make
the
openings
this
would
have
taken
too
long
with
the
pickaxe
alone
and
it
is
known
that
harding
was
an
ingenious
man
he
had
still
a
quantity
of
nitroglycerine
at
his
disposal
and
he
employed
it
usefully
by
means
of
this
explosive
substance
the
rock
was
broken
open
at
the
very
places
chosen
by
the
engineer
then
with
the
pickaxe
and
spade
the
windows
and
doors
were
properly
shaped
the
jagged
edges
were
smoothed
off
and
a
few
days
after
the
beginning
of
the
work
granite
house
was
abundantly
lighted
by
the
rising
sun
whose
rays
penetrated
into
its
most
secret
recesses
following
the
plan
proposed
by
cyrus
harding
the
space
was
to
be
divided
into
five
compartments
looking
out
on
the
sea
to
the
right
an
entry
with
a
door
which
would
meet
the
ladder
then
a
kitchen
thirty
feet
long
a
diningroom
measuring
forty
feet
a
sleepingroom
of
equal
size
and
lastly
a
visitors
room
petitioned
for
by
pencroft
and
which
was
next
to
the
great
hall
these
rooms
or
rather
this
suite
of
rooms
would
not
occupy
all
the
depth
of
the
cave
there
would
be
also
a
corridor
and
a
storehouse
in
which
their
tools
provisions
and
stores
would
be
kept
all
the
productions
of
the
island
the
flora
as
well
as
the
fauna
were
to
be
there
in
the
best
possible
state
of
preservation
and
completely
sheltered
from
the
damp
there
was
no
want
of
space
so
that
each
object
could
be
methodically
arranged
besides
the
colonists
had
still
at
their
disposal
the
little
grotto
above
the
great
cavern
which
was
like
the
garret
of
the
new
dwelling
this
plan
settled
it
had
only
to
be
put
into
execution
the
miners
became
brickmakers
again
then
the
bricks
were
brought
to
the
foot
of
granite
house
till
then
harding
and
his
companions
had
only
entered
the
cavern
by
the
long
passage
this
mode
of
communication
obliged
them
first
to
climb
prospect
heights
making
a
detour
by
the
rivers
bank
and
then
to
descend
two
hundred
feet
through
the
passage
having
to
climb
as
far
when
they
wished
to
return
to
the
plateau
this
was
a
great
loss
of
time
and
was
also
very
fatiguing
cyrus
harding
therefore
resolved
to
proceed
without
any
further
delay
to
the
fabrication
of
a
strong
rope
ladder
which
once
raised
would
render
granite
house
completely
inaccessible
this
ladder
was
manufactured
with
extreme
care
and
its
uprights
formed
of
the
twisted
fibers
of
a
species
of
cane
had
the
strength
of
a
thick
cable
as
to
the
rounds
they
were
made
of
a
sort
of
red
cedar
with
light
strong
branches
and
this
apparatus
was
wrought
by
the
masterly
hand
of
pencroft
other
ropes
were
made
with
vegetable
fibers
and
a
sort
of
crane
with
a
tackle
was
fixed
at
the
door
in
this
way
bricks
could
easily
be
raised
into
granite
house
the
transport
of
the
materials
being
thus
simplified
the
arrangement
of
the
interior
could
begin
immediately
there
was
no
want
of
lime
and
some
thousands
of
bricks
were
there
ready
to
be
used
the
framework
of
the
partitions
was
soon
raised
very
roughly
at
first
and
in
a
short
time
the
cave
was
divided
into
rooms
and
storehouses
according
to
the
plan
agreed
upon
these
different
works
progressed
rapidly
under
the
direction
of
the
engineer
who
himself
handled
the
hammer
and
the
trowel
no
labor
came
amiss
to
cyrus
harding
who
thus
set
an
example
to
his
intelligent
and
zealous
companions
they
worked
with
confidence
even
gaily
pencroft
always
having
some
joke
to
crack
sometimes
carpenter
sometimes
ropemaker
sometimes
mason
while
he
communicated
his
good
humor
to
all
the
members
of
their
little
world
his
faith
in
the
engineer
was
complete
nothing
could
disturb
it
he
believed
him
capable
of
undertaking
anything
and
succeeding
in
everything
the
question
of
boots
and
clothesassuredly
a
serious
questionthat
of
light
during
the
winter
months
utilizing
the
fertile
parts
of
the
island
transforming
the
wild
flora
into
cultivated
flora
it
all
appeared
easy
to
him
cyrus
harding
helping
everything
would
be
done
in
time
he
dreamed
of
canals
facilitating
the
transport
of
the
riches
of
the
ground
workings
of
quarries
and
mines

railroads
yes
railroads
of
which
a
network
would
certainly
one
day
cover
lincoln
island
the
engineer
let
pencroft
talk
he
did
not
put
down
the
aspirations
of
this
brave
heart
he
knew
how
communicable
confidence
is
he
even
smiled
to
hear
him
speak
and
said
nothing
of
the
uneasiness
for
the
future
which
he
felt
in
fact
in
that
part
of
the
pacific
out
of
the
course
of
vessels
it
was
to
be
feared
that
no
help
would
ever
come
to
them
it
was
on
themselves
on
themselves
alone
that
the
settlers
must
depend
for
the
distance
of
lincoln
island
from
all
other
land
was
such
that
to
hazard
themselves
in
a
boat
of
a
necessarily
inferior
construction
would
be
a
serious
and
perilous
thing
but
as
the
sailor
said
they
quite
took
the
wind
out
of
the
sails
of
the
robinsons
for
whom
everything
was
done
by
a
miracle
in
fact
they
were
energetic
an
energetic
man
will
succeed
where
an
indolent
one
would
vegetate
and
inevitably
perish
herbert
distinguished
himself
in
these
works
he
was
intelligent
and
active
understanding
quickly
he
performed
well
and
cyrus
harding
became
more
and
more
attached
to
the
boy
herbert
had
a
lively
and
reverent
love
for
the
engineer
pencroft
saw
the
close
sympathy
which
existed
between
the
two
but
he
was
not
in
the
least
jealous
neb
was
neb
he
was
what
he
would
be
always
courage
zeal
devotion
selfdenial
personified
he
had
the
same
faith
in
his
master
that
pencroft
had
but
he
showed
it
less
vehemently
when
the
sailor
was
enthusiastic
neb
always
looked
as
if
he
would
say
nothing
could
be
more
natural
pencroft
and
he
were
great
friends
as
to
gideon
spilett
he
took
part
in
the
common
work
and
was
not
less
skilful
in
it
than
his
companions
which
always
rather
astonished
the
sailor
a
journalist
clever
not
only
in
understanding
but
in
performing
everything
the
ladder
was
finally
fixed
on
the
28th
of
may
there
were
not
less
than
a
hundred
rounds
in
this
perpendicular
height
of
eighty
feet
harding
had
been
able
fortunately
to
divide
it
in
two
parts
profiting
by
an
overhanging
of
the
cliff
which
made
a
projection
forty
feet
above
the
ground
this
projection
carefully
leveled
by
the
pickaxe
made
a
sort
of
platform
to
which
they
fixed
the
first
ladder
of
which
the
oscillation
was
thus
diminished
onehalf
and
a
rope
permitted
it
to
be
raised
to
the
level
of
granite
house
as
to
the
second
ladder
it
was
secured
both
at
its
lower
part
which
rested
on
the
projection
and
at
its
upper
end
which
was
fastened
to
the
door
in
short
the
ascent
had
been
made
much
easier
besides
cyrus
harding
hoped
later
to
establish
an
hydraulic
apparatus
which
would
avoid
all
fatigue
and
loss
of
time
for
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
the
settlers
soon
became
habituated
to
the
use
of
this
ladder
they
were
light
and
active
and
pencroft
as
a
sailor
accustomed
to
run
up
the
masts
and
shrouds
was
able
to
give
them
lessons
but
it
was
also
necessary
to
give
them
to
top
the
poor
dog
with
his
four
paws
was
not
formed
for
this
sort
of
exercise
but
pencroft
was
such
a
zealous
master
that
top
ended
by
properly
performing
his
ascents
and
soon
mounted
the
ladder
as
readily
as
his
brethren
in
the
circus
it
need
not
be
said
that
the
sailor
was
proud
of
his
pupil
however
more
than
once
pencroft
hoisted
him
on
his
back
which
top
never
complained
of
it
must
be
mentioned
here
that
during
these
works
which
were
actively
conducted
for
the
bad
season
was
approaching
the
alimentary
question
was
not
neglected
every
day
the
reporter
and
herbert
who
had
been
voted
purveyors
to
the
colony
devoted
some
hours
to
the
chase
as
yet
they
only
hunted
in
jacamar
wood
on
the
left
of
the
river
because
for
want
of
a
bridge
or
boat
the
mercy
had
not
yet
been
crossed
all
the
immense
woods
to
which
the
name
of
the
forests
of
the
far
west
had
been
given
were
not
explored
they
reserved
this
important
excursion
for
the
first
fine
days
of
the
next
spring
but
jacamar
wood
was
full
of
game
kangaroos
and
boars
abounded
and
the
hunters
irontipped
spears
and
bows
and
arrows
did
wonders
besides
herbert
discovered
towards
the
southwest
point
of
the
lagoon
a
natural
warren
a
slightly
damp
meadow
covered
with
willows
and
aromatic
herbs
which
scented
the
air
such
as
thyme
basil
savory
all
the
sweetscented
species
of
the
labiated
plants
which
the
rabbits
appeared
to
be
particularly
fond
of
on
the
reporter
observing
that
since
the
table
was
spread
for
the
rabbits
it
was
strange
that
the
rabbits
themselves
should
be
wanting
the
two
sportsmen
carefully
explored
the
warren
at
any
rate
it
produced
an
abundance
of
useful
plants
and
a
naturalist
would
have
had
a
good
opportunity
of
studying
many
specimens
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
herbert
gathered
several
shoots
of
the
basil
rosemary
balm
betony
etc
which
possess
different
medicinal
properties
some
pectoral
astringent
febrifuge
others
antispasmodic
or
antirheumatic
when
afterwards
pencroft
asked
the
use
of
this
collection
of
herbs
for
medicine
replied
the
lad
to
treat
us
when
we
are
ill
why
should
we
be
ill
since
there
are
no
doctors
in
the
island
asked
pencroft
quite
seriously
there
was
no
reply
to
be
made
to
that
but
the
lad
went
on
with
his
collection
all
the
same
and
it
was
well
received
at
granite
house
besides
these
medicinal
herbs
he
added
a
plant
known
in
north
america
as
oswego
tea
which
made
an
excellent
beverage
at
last
by
searching
thoroughly
the
hunters
arrived
at
the
real
site
of
the
warren
there
the
ground
was
perforated
like
a
sieve
here
are
the
burrows
cried
herbert
yes
replied
the
reporter
so
i
see
but
are
they
inhabited
that
is
the
question
this
was
soon
answered
almost
immediately
hundreds
of
little
animals
similar
to
rabbits
fled
in
every
direction
with
such
rapidity
that
even
top
could
not
overtake
them
hunters
and
dog
ran
in
vain
these
rodents
escaped
them
easily
but
the
reporter
resolved
not
to
leave
the
place
until
he
had
captured
at
least
halfadozen
of
the
quadrupeds
he
wished
to
stock
their
larder
first
and
domesticate
those
which
they
might
take
later
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
do
this
with
a
few
snares
stretched
at
the
openings
of
the
burrows
but
at
this
moment
they
had
neither
snares
nor
anything
to
make
them
of
they
must
therefore
be
satisfied
with
visiting
each
hole
and
rummaging
in
it
with
a
stick
hoping
by
dint
of
patience
to
do
what
could
not
be
done
in
any
other
way
at
last
after
half
an
hour
four
rodents
were
taken
in
their
holes
they
were
similar
to
their
european
brethren
and
are
commonly
known
by
the
name
of
american
rabbits
this
produce
of
the
chase
was
brought
back
to
granite
house
and
figured
at
the
evening
repast
the
tenants
of
the
warren
were
not
at
all
to
be
despised
for
they
were
delicious
it
was
a
valuable
resource
of
the
colony
and
it
appeared
to
be
inexhaustible
on
the
31st
of
may
the
partitions
were
finished
the
rooms
had
now
only
to
be
furnished
and
this
would
be
work
for
the
long
winter
days
a
chimney
was
established
in
the
first
room
which
served
as
a
kitchen
the
pipe
destined
to
conduct
the
smoke
outside
gave
some
trouble
to
these
amateur
bricklayers
it
appeared
simplest
to
harding
to
make
it
of
brick
clay
as
creating
an
outlet
for
it
to
the
upper
plateau
was
not
to
be
thought
of
a
hole
was
pierced
in
the
granite
above
the
window
of
the
kitchen
and
the
pipe
met
it
like
that
of
an
iron
stove
perhaps
the
winds
which
blew
directly
against
the
facade
would
make
the
chimney
smoke
but
these
winds
were
rare
and
besides
master
neb
the
cook
was
not
so
very
particular
about
that
when
these
interior
arrangements
were
finished
the
engineer
occupied
himself
in
blocking
up
the
outlet
by
the
lake
so
as
to
prevent
any
access
by
that
way
masses
of
rock
were
rolled
to
the
entrance
and
strongly
cemented
together
cyrus
harding
did
not
yet
realize
his
plan
of
drowning
this
opening
under
the
waters
of
the
lake
by
restoring
them
to
their
former
level
by
means
of
a
dam
he
contented
himself
with
hiding
the
obstruction
with
grass
and
shrubs
which
were
planted
in
the
interstices
of
the
rocks
and
which
next
spring
would
sprout
thickly
however
he
used
the
waterfall
so
as
to
lead
a
small
stream
of
fresh
water
to
the
new
dwelling
a
little
trench
made
below
their
level
produced
this
result
and
this
derivation
from
a
pure
and
inexhaustible
source
yielded
twentyfive
or
thirty
gallons
a
day
there
would
never
be
any
want
of
water
at
granite
house
at
last
all
was
finished
and
it
was
time
for
the
bad
season
was
near
thick
shutters
closed
the
windows
of
the
facade
until
the
engineer
had
time
to
make
glass
gideon
spilett
had
very
artistically
arranged
on
the
rocky
projections
around
the
windows
plants
of
different
kinds
as
well
as
long
streaming
grass
so
that
the
openings
were
picturesquely
framed
in
green
which
had
a
pleasing
effect
the
inhabitants
of
this
solid
healthy
and
secure
dwelling
could
not
but
be
charmed
with
their
work
the
view
from
the
windows
extended
over
a
boundless
horizon
which
was
closed
by
the
two
mandible
capes
on
the
north
and
claw
cape
on
the
south
all
union
bay
was
spread
before
them
yes
our
brave
settlers
had
reason
to
be
satisfied
and
pencroft
was
lavish
in
his
praise
of
what
he
humorously
called
his
apartments
on
the
fifth
floor
above
the
ground
chapter
20
the
winter
season
set
in
with
the
month
of
june
which
corresponds
with
the
month
of
december
in
the
northern
hemisphere
it
began
with
showers
and
squalls
which
succeeded
each
other
without
intermission
the
tenants
of
granite
house
could
appreciate
the
advantages
of
a
dwelling
which
sheltered
them
from
the
inclement
weather
the
chimneys
would
have
been
quite
insufficient
to
protect
them
against
the
rigor
of
winter
and
it
was
to
be
feared
that
the
high
tides
would
make
another
irruption
cyrus
harding
had
taken
precautions
against
this
contingency
so
as
to
preserve
as
much
as
possible
the
forge
and
furnace
which
were
established
there
during
the
whole
of
the
month
of
june
the
time
was
employed
in
different
occupations
which
excluded
neither
hunting
nor
fishing
the
larder
being
therefore
abundantly
supplied
pencroft
so
soon
as
he
had
leisure
proposed
to
set
some
traps
from
which
he
expected
great
results
he
soon
made
some
snares
with
creepers
by
the
aid
of
which
the
warren
henceforth
every
day
furnished
its
quota
of
rodents
neb
employed
nearly
all
his
time
in
salting
or
smoking
meat
which
insured
their
always
having
plenty
of
provisions
the
question
of
clothes
was
now
seriously
discussed
the
settlers
having
no
other
garments
than
those
they
wore
when
the
balloon
threw
them
on
the
island
these
clothes
were
warm
and
good
they
had
taken
great
care
of
them
as
well
as
of
their
linen
and
they
were
perfectly
whole
but
they
would
soon
need
to
be
replaced
moreover
if
the
winter
was
severe
the
settlers
would
suffer
greatly
from
cold
on
this
subject
the
ingenuity
of
harding
was
at
fault
they
must
provide
for
their
most
pressing
wants
settle
their
dwelling
and
lay
in
a
store
of
food
thus
the
cold
might
come
upon
them
before
the
question
of
clothes
had
been
settled
they
must
therefore
make
up
their
minds
to
pass
this
first
winter
without
additional
clothing
when
the
fine
season
came
round
again
they
would
regularly
hunt
those
musmons
which
had
been
seen
on
the
expedition
to
mount
franklin
and
the
wool
once
collected
the
engineer
would
know
how
to
make
it
into
strong
warm
stuff
how
he
would
consider
well
we
are
free
to
roast
ourselves
at
granite
house
said
pencroft
there
are
heaps
of
fuel
and
no
reason
for
sparing
it
besides
added
gideon
spilett
lincoln
island
is
not
situated
under
a
very
high
latitude
and
probably
the
winters
here
are
not
severe
did
you
not
say
cyrus
that
this
thirtyfifth
parallel
corresponded
to
that
of
spain
in
the
other
hemisphere
doubtless
replied
the
engineer
but
some
winters
in
spain
are
very
cold
no
want
of
snow
and
ice
and
perhaps
lincoln
island
is
just
as
rigorously
tried
however
it
is
an
island
and
as
such
i
hope
that
the
temperature
will
be
more
moderate
why
captain
asked
herbert
because
the
sea
my
boy
may
be
considered
as
an
immense
reservoir
in
which
is
stored
the
heat
of
the
summer
when
winter
comes
it
restores
this
heat
which
insures
for
the
regions
near
the
ocean
a
medium
temperature
less
high
in
summer
but
less
low
in
winter
we
shall
prove
that
replied
pencroft
but
i
dont
want
to
bother
myself
about
whether
it
will
be
cold
or
not
one
thing
is
certain
that
is
that
the
days
are
already
short
and
the
evenings
long
suppose
we
talk
about
the
question
of
light
nothing
is
easier
replied
harding
to
talk
about
asked
the
sailor
to
settle
and
when
shall
we
begin
tomorrow
by
having
a
seal
hunt
to
make
candles
yes
such
was
the
engineers
project
and
it
was
quite
feasible
since
he
had
lime
and
sulphuric
acid
while
the
amphibians
of
the
islet
would
furnish
the
fat
necessary
for
the
manufacture
they
were
now
at
the
4th
of
june
it
was
whit
sunday
and
they
agreed
to
observe
this
feast
all
work
was
suspended
and
prayers
were
offered
to
heaven
but
these
prayers
were
now
thanksgivings
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
were
no
longer
the
miserable
castaways
thrown
on
the
islet
they
asked
for
nothing
morethey
gave
thanks
the
next
day
the
5th
of
june
in
rather
uncertain
weather
they
set
out
for
the
islet
they
had
to
profit
by
the
low
tide
to
cross
the
channel
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
would
construct
for
this
purpose
as
well
as
they
could
a
boat
which
would
render
communication
so
much
easier
and
would
also
permit
them
to
ascend
the
mercy
at
the
time
of
their
grand
exploration
of
the
southwest
of
the
island
which
was
put
off
till
the
first
fine
days
the
seals
were
numerous
and
the
hunters
armed
with
their
irontipped
spears
easily
killed
halfadozen
neb
and
pencroft
skinned
them
and
only
brought
back
to
granite
house
their
fat
and
skin
this
skin
being
intended
for
the
manufacture
of
boots
the
result
of
the
hunt
was
this
nearly
three
hundred
pounds
of
fat
all
to
be
employed
in
the
fabrication
of
candles
the
operation
was
extremely
simple
and
if
it
did
not
yield
absolutely
perfect
results
they
were
at
least
very
useful
cyrus
harding
would
only
have
had
at
his
disposal
sulphuric
acid
but
by
heating
this
acid
with
the
neutral
fatty
bodies
he
could
separate
the
glycerine
then
from
this
new
combination
he
easily
separated
the
olein
the
margarin
and
the
stearin
by
employing
boiling
water
but
to
simplify
the
operation
he
preferred
to
saponify
the
fat
by
means
of
lime
by
this
he
obtained
a
calcareous
soap
easy
to
decompose
by
sulphuric
acid
which
precipitated
the
lime
into
the
state
of
sulphate
and
liberated
the
fatty
acids
from
these
three
acidsoleic
margaric
and
stearicthe
first
being
liquid
was
driven
out
by
a
sufficient
pressure
as
to
the
two
others
they
formed
the
very
substance
of
which
the
candles
were
to
be
molded
this
operation
did
not
last
more
than
four
and
twenty
hours
the
wicks
after
several
trials
were
made
of
vegetable
fibers
and
dipped
in
the
liquefied
substance
they
formed
regular
stearic
candles
molded
by
the
hand
which
only
wanted
whiteness
and
polish
they
would
not
doubtless
have
the
advantages
of
the
wicks
which
are
impregnated
with
boracic
acid
and
which
vitrify
as
they
burn
and
are
entirely
consumed
but
cyrus
harding
having
manufactured
a
beautiful
pair
of
snuffers
these
candles
would
be
greatly
appreciated
during
the
long
evenings
in
granite
house
during
this
month
there
was
no
want
of
work
in
the
interior
of
their
new
dwelling
the
joiners
had
plenty
to
do
they
improved
their
tools
which
were
very
rough
and
added
others
also
scissors
were
made
among
other
things
and
the
settlers
were
at
last
able
to
cut
their
hair
and
also
to
shave
or
at
least
trim
their
beards
herbert
had
none
neb
but
little
but
their
companions
were
bristling
in
a
way
which
justified
the
making
of
the
said
scissors
the
manufacture
of
a
handsaw
cost
infinite
trouble
but
at
last
an
instrument
was
obtained
which
when
vigorously
handled
could
divide
the
ligneous
fibers
of
the
wood
they
then
made
tables
seats
cupboards
to
furnish
the
principal
rooms
and
bedsteads
of
which
all
the
bedding
consisted
of
grass
mattresses
the
kitchen
with
its
shelves
on
which
rested
the
cooking
utensils
its
brick
stove
looked
very
well
and
neb
worked
away
there
as
earnestly
as
if
he
was
in
a
chemists
laboratory
but
the
joiners
had
soon
to
be
replaced
by
carpenters
in
fact
the
waterfall
created
by
the
explosion
rendered
the
construction
of
two
bridges
necessary
one
on
prospect
heights
the
other
on
the
shore
now
the
plateau
and
the
shore
were
transversely
divided
by
a
watercourse
which
had
to
be
crossed
to
reach
the
northern
part
of
the
island
to
avoid
it
the
colonists
had
been
obliged
to
make
a
considerable
detour
by
climbing
up
to
the
source
of
the
red
creek
the
simplest
thing
was
to
establish
on
the
plateau
and
on
the
shore
two
bridges
from
twenty
to
five
and
twenty
feet
in
length
all
the
carpenters
work
that
was
needed
was
to
clear
some
trees
of
their
branches
this
was
a
business
of
some
days
directly
the
bridges
were
established
neb
and
pencroft
profited
by
them
to
go
to
the
oysterbed
which
had
been
discovered
near
the
downs
they
dragged
with
them
a
sort
of
rough
cart
which
replaced
the
former
inconvenient
hurdle
and
brought
back
some
thousands
of
oysters
which
soon
increased
among
the
rocks
and
formed
a
bed
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
these
molluscs
were
of
excellent
quality
and
the
colonists
consumed
some
daily
it
has
been
seen
that
lincoln
island
although
its
inhabitants
had
as
yet
only
explored
a
small
portion
of
it
already
contributed
to
almost
all
their
wants
it
was
probable
that
if
they
hunted
into
its
most
secret
recesses
in
all
the
wooded
part
between
the
mercy
and
reptile
point
they
would
find
new
treasures
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
had
still
one
privation
there
was
no
want
of
meat
nor
of
vegetable
products
those
ligneous
roots
which
they
had
found
when
subjected
to
fermentation
gave
them
an
acid
drink
which
was
preferable
to
cold
water
they
also
made
sugar
without
canes
or
beetroots
by
collecting
the
liquor
which
distils
from
the
acer
saceharinum
a
sort
of
mapletree
which
flourishes
in
all
the
temperate
zones
and
of
which
the
island
possessed
a
great
number
they
made
a
very
agreeable
tea
by
employing
the
herbs
brought
from
the
warren
lastly
they
had
an
abundance
of
salt
the
only
mineral
which
is
used
in
food
but
bread
was
wanting
perhaps
in
time
the
settlers
could
replace
this
want
by
some
equivalent
it
was
possible
that
they
might
find
the
sago
or
the
breadfruit
tree
among
the
forests
of
the
south
but
they
had
not
as
yet
met
with
these
precious
trees
however
providence
came
directly
to
their
aid
in
an
infinitesimal
proportion
it
is
true
but
cyrus
harding
with
all
his
intelligence
all
his
ingenuity
would
never
have
been
able
to
produce
that
which
by
the
greatest
chance
herbert
one
day
found
in
the
lining
of
his
waistcoat
which
he
was
occupied
in
setting
to
rights
on
this
day
as
it
was
raining
in
torrents
the
settlers
were
assembled
in
the
great
hall
in
granite
house
when
the
lad
cried
out
all
at
once
look
here
captaina
grain
of
corn
and
he
showed
his
companions
a
graina
single
grainwhich
from
a
hole
in
his
pocket
had
got
into
the
lining
of
his
waistcoat
the
presence
of
this
grain
was
explained
by
the
fact
that
herbert
when
at
richmond
used
to
feed
some
pigeons
of
which
pencroft
had
made
him
a
present
a
grain
of
corn
said
the
engineer
quickly
yes
captain
but
one
only
one
well
my
boy
said
pencroft
laughing
were
getting
on
capitally
upon
my
word
what
shall
we
make
with
one
grain
of
corn
we
will
make
bread
of
it
replied
cyrus
harding
bread
cakes
tarts
replied
the
sailor
come
the
bread
that
this
grain
of
corn
will
make
wont
choke
us
very
soon
herbert
not
attaching
much
importance
to
his
discovery
was
going
to
throw
away
the
grain
in
question
but
harding
took
it
examined
it
found
that
it
was
in
good
condition
and
looking
the
sailor
full
in
the
facepencroft
he
asked
quietly
do
you
know
how
many
ears
one
grain
of
corn
can
produce
one
i
suppose
replied
the
sailor
surprised
at
the
question
ten
pencroft
and
do
you
know
how
many
grains
one
ear
bears
no
upon
my
word
about
eighty
said
cyrus
harding
then
if
we
plant
this
grain
at
the
first
crop
we
shall
reap
eight
hundred
grains
which
at
the
second
will
produce
six
hundred
and
forty
thousand
at
the
third
five
hundred
and
twelve
millions
at
the
fourth
more
than
four
hundred
thousands
of
millions
there
is
the
proportion
hardings
companions
listened
without
answering
these
numbers
astonished
them
they
were
exact
however
yes
my
friends
continued
the
engineer
such
are
the
arithmetical
progressions
of
prolific
nature
and
yet
what
is
this
multiplication
of
the
grain
of
corn
of
which
the
ear
only
bears
eight
hundred
grains
compared
to
the
poppyplant
which
bears
thirtytwo
thousand
seeds
to
the
tobaccoplant
which
produces
three
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
in
a
few
years
without
the
numerous
causes
of
destruction
which
arrests
their
fecundity
these
plants
would
overrun
the
earth
but
the
engineer
had
not
finished
his
lecture
and
now
pencroft
he
continued
do
you
know
how
many
bushels
four
hundred
thousand
millions
of
grains
would
make
no
replied
the
sailor
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
i
am
nothing
better
than
a
fool
well
they
would
make
more
than
three
millions
at
a
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
a
bushel
pencroft
three
millions
cried
pencroft
three
millions
in
four
years
in
four
years
replied
cyrus
harding
and
even
in
two
years
if
as
i
hope
in
this
latitude
we
can
obtain
two
crops
a
year
at
that
according
to
his
usual
custom
pencroft
could
not
reply
otherwise
than
by
a
tremendous
hurrah
so
herbert
added
the
engineer
you
have
made
a
discovery
of
great
importance
to
us
everything
my
friends
everything
can
serve
us
in
the
condition
in
which
we
are
do
not
forget
that
i
beg
of
you
no
captain
no
we
shant
forget
it
replied
pencroft
and
if
ever
i
find
one
of
those
tobaccoseeds
which
multiply
by
three
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
i
assure
you
i
wont
throw
it
away
and
now
what
must
we
do
we
must
plant
this
grain
replied
herbert
yes
added
gideon
spilett
and
with
every
possible
care
for
it
bears
in
itself
our
future
harvests
provided
it
grows
cried
the
sailor
it
will
grow
replied
cyrus
harding
this
was
the
20th
of
june
the
time
was
then
propitious
for
sowing
this
single
precious
grain
of
corn
it
was
first
proposed
to
plant
it
in
a
pot
but
upon
reflection
it
was
decided
to
leave
it
to
nature
and
confide
it
to
the
earth
this
was
done
that
very
day
and
it
is
needless
to
add
that
every
precaution
was
taken
that
the
experiment
might
succeed
the
weather
having
cleared
the
settlers
climbed
the
height
above
granite
house
there
on
the
plateau
they
chose
a
spot
well
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
exposed
to
all
the
heat
of
the
midday
sun
the
place
was
cleared
carefully
weeded
and
searched
for
insects
and
worms
then
a
bed
of
good
earth
improved
with
a
little
lime
was
made
it
was
surrounded
by
a
railing
and
the
grain
was
buried
in
the
damp
earth
did
it
not
seem
as
if
the
settlers
were
laying
the
first
stone
of
some
edifice
it
recalled
to
pencroft
the
day
on
which
he
lighted
his
only
match
and
all
the
anxiety
of
the
operation
but
this
time
the
thing
was
more
serious
in
fact
the
castaways
would
have
been
always
able
to
procure
fire
in
some
mode
or
other
but
no
human
power
could
supply
another
grain
of
corn
if
unfortunately
this
should
be
lost
chapter
21
from
this
time
pencroft
did
not
let
a
single
day
pass
without
going
to
visit
what
he
gravely
called
his
cornfield
and
woe
to
the
insects
which
dared
to
venture
there
no
mercy
was
shown
them
towards
the
end
of
the
month
of
june
after
incessant
rain
the
weather
became
decidedly
colder
and
on
the
29th
a
fahrenheit
thermometer
would
certainly
have
announced
only
twenty
degrees
above
zero
that
is
considerably
below
the
freezingpoint
the
next
day
the
30th
of
june
the
day
which
corresponds
to
the
31st
of
december
in
the
northern
year
was
a
friday
neb
remarked
that
the
year
finished
on
a
bad
day
but
pencroft
replied
that
naturally
the
next
would
begin
on
a
good
one
which
was
better
at
any
rate
it
commenced
by
very
severe
cold
ice
accumulated
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
whole
expanse
of
the
lake
was
frozen
the
settlers
had
frequently
been
obliged
to
renew
their
store
of
wood
pencroft
also
had
wisely
not
waited
till
the
river
was
frozen
but
had
brought
enormous
rafts
of
wood
to
their
destination
the
current
was
an
indefatigable
moving
power
and
it
was
employed
in
conveying
the
floating
wood
to
the
moment
when
the
frost
enchained
it
to
the
fuel
which
was
so
abundantly
supplied
by
the
forest
they
added
several
cartloads
of
coal
which
had
to
be
brought
from
the
foot
of
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
the
powerful
heat
of
the
coal
was
greatly
appreciated
in
the
low
temperature
which
on
the
4th
of
july
fell
to
eight
degrees
of
fahrenheit
that
is
thirteen
degrees
below
zero
a
second
fireplace
had
been
established
in
the
diningroom
where
they
all
worked
together
at
their
different
avocations
during
this
period
of
cold
cyrus
harding
had
great
cause
to
congratulate
himself
on
having
brought
to
granite
house
the
little
stream
of
water
from
lake
grant
taken
below
the
frozen
surface
and
conducted
through
the
passage
it
preserved
its
fluidity
and
arrived
at
an
interior
reservoir
which
had
been
hollowed
out
at
the
back
part
of
the
storeroom
while
the
overflow
ran
through
the
well
to
the
sea
about
this
time
the
weather
being
extremely
dry
the
colonists
clothed
as
warmly
as
possible
resolved
to
devote
a
day
to
the
exploration
of
that
part
of
the
island
between
the
mercy
and
claw
cape
it
was
a
wide
extent
of
marshy
land
and
they
would
probably
find
good
sport
for
waterbirds
ought
to
swarm
there
they
reckoned
that
it
would
be
about
eight
or
nine
miles
to
go
there
and
as
much
to
return
so
that
the
whole
of
the
day
would
be
occupied
as
an
unknown
part
of
the
island
was
about
to
be
explored
the
whole
colony
took
part
in
the
expedition
accordingly
on
the
5th
of
july
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
when
day
had
scarcely
broken
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
herbert
neb
and
pencroft
armed
with
spears
snares
bows
and
arrows
and
provided
with
provisions
left
granite
house
preceded
by
top
who
bounded
before
them
their
shortest
way
was
to
cross
the
mercy
on
the
ice
which
then
covered
it
but
as
the
engineer
justly
observed
that
could
not
take
the
place
of
a
regular
bridge
so
the
construction
of
a
regular
bridge
was
noted
in
the
list
of
future
works
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
settlers
had
set
foot
on
the
right
bank
of
the
mercy
and
ventured
into
the
midst
of
those
gigantic
and
superb
coniferae
now
sprinkled
over
with
snow
but
they
had
not
gone
half
a
mile
when
from
a
thicket
a
whole
family
of
quadrupeds
who
had
made
a
home
there
disturbed
by
top
rushed
forth
into
the
open
country
ah
i
should
say
those
are
foxes
cried
herbert
when
he
saw
the
troop
rapidly
decamping
they
were
foxes
but
of
a
very
large
size
who
uttered
a
sort
of
barking
at
which
top
seemed
to
be
very
much
astonished
for
he
stopped
short
in
the
chase
and
gave
the
swift
animals
time
to
disappear
the
dog
had
reason
to
be
surprised
as
he
did
not
know
natural
history
but
by
their
barking
these
foxes
with
reddishgray
hair
black
tails
terminating
in
a
white
tuft
had
betrayed
their
origin
so
herbert
was
able
without
hesitating
to
give
them
their
real
name
of
arctic
foxes
they
are
frequently
met
with
in
chile
in
the
falkland
islands
and
in
all
parts
of
america
traversed
by
the
thirtieth
and
fortieth
parallels
herbert
much
regretted
that
top
had
not
been
able
to
catch
one
of
these
carnivora
are
they
good
to
eat
asked
pencroft
who
only
regarded
the
representatives
of
the
fauna
in
the
island
from
one
special
point
of
view
no
replied
herbert
but
zoologists
have
not
yet
found
out
if
the
eye
of
these
foxes
is
diurnal
or
nocturnal
or
whether
it
is
correct
to
class
them
in
the
genus
dog
properly
so
called
harding
could
not
help
smiling
on
hearing
the
lads
reflection
which
showed
a
thoughtful
mind
as
to
the
sailor
from
the
moment
when
he
found
that
the
foxes
were
not
classed
in
the
genus
eatable
they
were
nothing
to
him
however
when
a
poultryyard
was
established
at
granite
house
he
observed
that
it
would
be
best
to
take
some
precautions
against
a
probable
visit
from
these
fourlegged
plunderers
and
no
one
disputed
this
after
having
turned
the
point
the
settlers
saw
a
long
beach
washed
by
the
open
sea
it
was
then
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
the
sky
was
very
clear
as
it
often
is
after
prolonged
cold
but
warmed
by
their
walk
neither
harding
nor
his
companions
felt
the
sharpness
of
the
atmosphere
too
severely
besides
there
was
no
wind
which
made
it
much
more
bearable
a
brilliant
sun
but
without
any
calorific
action
was
just
issuing
from
the
ocean
the
sea
was
as
tranquil
and
blue
as
that
of
a
mediterranean
gulf
when
the
sky
is
clear
claw
cape
bent
in
the
form
of
a
yataghan
tapered
away
nearly
four
miles
to
the
southeast
to
the
left
the
edge
of
the
marsh
was
abruptly
ended
by
a
little
point
certainly
in
this
part
of
union
bay
which
nothing
sheltered
from
the
open
sea
not
even
a
sandbank
ships
beaten
by
the
east
winds
would
have
found
no
shelter
they
perceived
by
the
tranquillity
of
the
sea
in
which
no
shallows
troubled
the
waters
by
its
uniform
color
which
was
stained
by
no
yellow
shades
by
the
absence
of
even
a
reef
that
the
coast
was
steep
and
that
the
ocean
there
covered
a
deep
abyss
behind
in
the
west
but
at
a
distance
of
four
miles
rose
the
first
trees
of
the
forests
of
the
far
west
they
might
have
believed
themselves
to
be
on
the
desolate
coast
of
some
island
in
the
antarctic
regions
which
the
ice
had
invaded
the
colonists
halted
at
this
place
for
breakfast
a
fire
of
brushwood
and
dried
seaweed
was
lighted
and
neb
prepared
the
breakfast
of
cold
meat
to
which
he
added
some
cups
of
oswego
tea
while
eating
they
looked
around
them
this
part
of
lincoln
island
was
very
sterile
and
contrasted
with
all
the
western
part
the
reporter
was
thus
led
to
observe
that
if
chance
had
thrown
them
at
first
on
the
shore
they
would
have
had
but
a
deplorable
idea
of
their
future
domain
i
believe
that
we
should
not
have
been
able
to
reach
it
replied
the
engineer
for
the
sea
is
deep
and
there
is
not
a
rock
on
which
we
could
have
taken
refuge
before
granite
house
at
least
there
were
sandbanks
an
islet
which
multiplied
our
chances
of
safety
here
nothing
but
the
depths
it
is
singular
enough
remarked
spilett
that
this
comparatively
small
island
should
present
such
varied
ground
this
diversity
of
aspect
logically
only
belongs
to
continents
of
a
certain
extent
one
would
really
say
that
the
western
part
of
lincoln
island
so
rich
and
so
fertile
is
washed
by
the
warm
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
that
its
shores
to
the
north
and
the
southeast
extend
over
a
sort
of
arctic
sea
you
are
right
my
dear
spilett
replied
cyrus
harding
i
have
also
observed
this
i
think
the
form
and
also
the
nature
of
this
island
strange
it
is
a
summary
of
all
the
aspects
which
a
continent
presents
and
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
it
was
a
continent
formerly
what
a
continent
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
cried
pencroft
why
not
replied
cyrus
harding
why
should
not
australia
new
ireland
australasia
united
to
the
archipelagoes
of
the
pacific
have
once
formed
a
sixth
part
of
the
world
as
important
as
europe
or
asia
as
africa
or
the
two
americas
to
my
mind
it
is
quite
possible
that
all
these
islands
emerging
from
this
vast
ocean
are
but
the
summits
of
a
continent
now
submerged
but
which
was
above
the
waters
at
a
prehistoric
period
as
the
atlantis
was
formerly
replied
herbert
yes
my
boy
if
however
it
existed
and
would
lincoln
island
have
been
a
part
of
that
continent
asked
pencroft
it
is
probable
replied
cyrus
harding
and
that
would
sufficiently
explain
the
variety
of
productions
which
are
seen
on
its
surface
and
the
great
number
of
animals
which
still
inhabit
it
added
herbert
yes
my
boy
replied
the
engineer
and
you
furnish
me
with
an
argument
to
support
my
theory
it
is
certain
after
what
we
have
seen
that
animals
are
numerous
in
this
island
and
what
is
more
strange
that
the
species
are
extremely
varied
there
is
a
reason
for
that
and
to
me
it
is
that
lincoln
island
may
have
formerly
been
a
part
of
some
vast
continent
which
had
gradually
sunk
below
the
pacific
then
some
fine
day
said
pencroft
who
did
not
appear
to
be
entirely
convinced
the
rest
of
this
ancient
continent
may
disappear
in
its
turn
and
there
will
be
nothing
between
america
and
asia
yes
replied
harding
there
will
be
new
continents
which
millions
and
millions
of
animalculae
are
building
at
this
moment
and
what
are
these
masons
asked
pencroft
coral
insects
replied
cyrus
harding
by
constant
work
they
made
the
island
of
clermonttonnerre
and
numerous
other
coral
islands
in
the
pacific
ocean
fortyseven
millions
of
these
insects
are
needed
to
weigh
a
grain
and
yet
with
the
seasalt
they
absorb
the
solid
elements
of
water
which
they
assimilate
these
animalculae
produce
limestone
and
this
limestone
forms
enormous
submarine
erections
of
which
the
hardness
and
solidity
equal
granite
formerly
at
the
first
periods
of
creation
nature
employing
fire
heaved
up
the
land
but
now
she
entrusts
to
these
microscopic
creatures
the
task
of
replacing
this
agent
of
which
the
dynamic
power
in
the
interior
of
the
globe
has
evidently
diminishedwhich
is
proved
by
the
number
of
volcanoes
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
now
actually
extinct
and
i
believe
that
centuries
succeeding
to
centuries
and
insects
to
insects
this
pacific
may
one
day
be
changed
into
a
vast
continent
which
new
generations
will
inhabit
and
civilize
in
their
turn
that
will
take
a
long
time
said
pencroft
nature
has
time
for
it
replied
the
engineer
but
what
would
be
the
use
of
new
continents
asked
herbert
it
appears
to
me
that
the
present
extent
of
habitable
countries
is
sufficient
for
humanity
yet
nature
does
nothing
uselessly
nothing
uselessly
certainly
replied
the
engineer
but
this
is
how
the
necessity
of
new
continents
for
the
future
and
exactly
on
the
tropical
zone
occupied
by
the
coral
islands
may
be
explained
at
least
to
me
this
explanation
appears
plausible
we
are
listening
captain
said
herbert
this
is
my
idea
philosophers
generally
admit
that
some
day
our
globe
will
end
or
rather
that
animal
and
vegetable
life
will
no
longer
be
possible
because
of
the
intense
cold
to
which
it
will
be
subjected
what
they
are
not
agreed
upon
is
the
cause
of
this
cold
some
think
that
it
will
arise
from
the
falling
of
the
temperature
which
the
sun
will
experience
after
millions
of
years
others
from
the
gradual
extinction
of
the
fires
in
the
interior
of
our
globe
which
have
a
greater
influence
on
it
than
is
generally
supposed
i
hold
to
this
last
hypothesis
grounding
it
on
the
fact
that
the
moon
is
really
a
cold
star
which
is
no
longer
habitable
although
the
sun
continues
to
throw
on
its
surface
the
same
amount
of
heat
if
then
the
moon
has
become
cold
it
is
because
the
interior
fires
to
which
as
do
all
the
stars
of
the
stellar
world
it
owes
its
origin
are
completely
extinct
lastly
whatever
may
be
the
cause
our
globe
will
become
cold
some
day
but
this
cold
will
only
operate
gradually
what
will
happen
then
the
temperate
zones
at
a
more
or
less
distant
period
will
not
be
more
habitable
than
the
polar
regions
now
are
then
the
population
of
men
as
well
as
the
animals
will
flow
towards
the
latitudes
which
are
more
directly
under
the
solar
influence
an
immense
emigration
will
take
place
europe
central
asia
north
america
will
gradually
be
abandoned
as
well
as
australasia
and
the
lower
parts
of
south
america
the
vegetation
will
follow
the
human
emigration
the
flora
will
retreat
towards
the
equator
at
the
same
time
as
the
fauna
the
central
parts
of
south
america
and
africa
will
be
the
continents
chiefly
inhabited
the
laplanders
and
the
samoides
will
find
the
climate
of
the
polar
regions
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
who
can
say
that
at
this
period
the
equatorial
regions
will
not
be
too
small
to
contain
and
nourish
terrestrial
humanity
now
may
not
provident
nature
so
as
to
give
refuge
to
all
the
vegetable
and
animal
emigration
be
at
present
laying
the
foundation
of
a
new
continent
under
the
equator
and
may
she
not
have
entrusted
these
insects
with
the
construction
of
it
i
have
often
thought
of
all
these
things
my
friends
and
i
seriously
believe
that
the
aspect
of
our
globe
will
some
day
be
completely
changed
that
by
the
raising
of
new
continents
the
sea
will
cover
the
old
and
that
in
future
ages
a
columbus
will
go
to
discover
the
islands
of
chimborazo
of
the
himalayas
or
of
mont
blanc
remains
of
a
submerged
america
asia
and
europe
then
these
new
continents
will
become
in
their
turn
uninhabitable
heat
will
die
away
as
does
the
heat
from
a
body
when
the
soul
has
left
it
and
life
will
disappear
from
the
globe
if
not
for
ever
at
least
for
a
period
perhaps
then
our
spheroid
will
restwill
be
left
to
deathto
revive
some
day
under
superior
conditions
but
all
that
my
friends
is
the
secret
of
the
author
of
all
things
and
beginning
by
the
work
of
the
insects
i
have
perhaps
let
myself
be
carried
too
far
in
investigating
the
secrets
of
the
future
my
dear
cyrus
replied
spilett
these
theories
are
prophecies
to
me
and
they
will
be
accomplished
some
day
that
is
the
secret
of
god
said
the
engineer
all
that
is
well
and
good
then
said
pencroft
who
had
listened
with
all
his
might
but
will
you
tell
me
captain
if
lincoln
island
has
been
made
by
your
insects
no
replied
harding
it
is
of
a
purely
volcanic
origin
then
it
will
disappear
some
day
that
is
probable
i
hope
we
wont
be
here
then
no
dont
be
uneasy
pencroft
we
shall
not
be
here
then
as
we
have
no
wish
to
die
here
and
hope
to
get
away
some
time
in
the
meantime
replied
gideon
spilett
let
us
establish
ourselves
here
as
if
forever
there
is
no
use
in
doing
things
by
halves
this
ended
the
conversation
breakfast
was
finished
the
exploration
was
continued
and
the
settlers
arrived
at
the
border
of
the
marshy
region
it
was
a
marsh
of
which
the
extent
to
the
rounded
coast
which
terminated
the
island
at
the
southeast
was
about
twenty
square
miles
the
soil
was
formed
of
clayey
flintearth
mingled
with
vegetable
matter
such
as
the
remains
of
rushes
reeds
grass
etc
here
and
there
beds
of
grass
thick
as
a
carpet
covered
it
in
many
places
icy
pools
sparkled
in
the
sun
neither
rain
nor
any
river
increased
by
a
sudden
swelling
could
supply
these
ponds
they
therefore
naturally
concluded
that
the
marsh
was
fed
by
the
infiltrations
of
the
soil
and
it
was
really
so
it
was
also
to
be
feared
that
during
the
heat
miasmas
would
arise
which
might
produce
fevers
above
the
aquatic
plants
on
the
surface
of
the
stagnant
water
fluttered
numbers
of
birds
wild
duck
teal
snipe
lived
there
in
flocks
and
those
fearless
birds
allowed
themselves
to
be
easily
approached
one
shot
from
a
gun
would
certainly
have
brought
down
some
dozen
of
the
birds
they
were
so
close
together
the
explorers
were
however
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
bows
and
arrows
the
result
was
less
but
the
silent
arrow
had
the
advantage
of
not
frightening
the
birds
while
the
noise
of
firearms
would
have
dispersed
them
to
all
parts
of
the
marsh
the
hunters
were
satisfied
for
this
time
with
a
dozen
ducks
which
had
white
bodies
with
a
band
of
cinnamon
a
green
head
wings
black
white
and
red
and
flattened
beak
herbert
called
them
tadorns
top
helped
in
the
capture
of
these
birds
whose
name
was
given
to
this
marshy
part
of
the
island
the
settlers
had
here
an
abundant
reserve
of
aquatic
game
at
some
future
time
they
meant
to
explore
it
more
carefully
and
it
was
probable
that
some
of
the
birds
there
might
be
domesticated
or
at
least
brought
to
the
shores
of
the
lake
so
that
they
would
be
more
within
their
reach
about
five
oclock
in
the
evening
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
retraced
their
steps
to
their
dwelling
by
traversing
tadorns
fens
and
crossed
the
mercy
on
the
icebridge
at
eight
in
the
evening
they
all
entered
granite
house
chapter

this
intense
cold
lasted
till
the
15th
of
august
without
however
passing
the
degree
of
fahrenheit
already
mentioned
when
the
atmosphere
was
calm
the
low
temperature
was
easily
borne
but
when
the
wind
blew
the
poor
settlers
insufficiently
clothed
felt
it
severely
pencroft
regretted
that
lincoln
island
was
not
the
home
of
a
few
families
of
bears
rather
than
of
so
many
foxes
and
seals
bears
said
he
are
generally
very
well
dressed
and
i
ask
no
more
than
to
borrow
for
the
winter
the
warm
cloaks
which
they
have
on
their
backs
but
replied
neb
laughing
perhaps
the
bears
would
not
consent
to
give
you
their
cloaks
pencroft
these
beasts
are
not
st
martins
we
would
make
them
do
it
neb
we
would
make
them
replied
pencroft
in
quite
an
authoritative
tone
but
these
formidable
carnivora
did
not
exist
in
the
island
or
at
any
rate
they
had
not
yet
shown
themselves
in
the
meanwhile
herbert
pencroft
and
the
reporter
occupied
themselves
with
making
traps
on
prospect
heights
and
at
the
border
of
the
forest
according
to
the
sailor
any
animal
whatever
it
was
would
be
a
lawful
prize
and
the
rodents
or
carnivora
which
might
get
into
the
new
snares
would
be
well
received
at
granite
house
the
traps
were
besides
extremely
simple
being
pits
dug
in
the
ground
a
platform
of
branches
and
grass
above
which
concealed
the
opening
and
at
the
bottom
some
bait
the
scent
of
which
would
attract
animals
it
must
be
mentioned
also
that
they
had
not
been
dug
at
random
but
at
certain
places
where
numerous
footprints
showed
that
quadrupeds
frequented
the
ground
they
were
visited
every
day
and
at
three
different
times
during
the
first
days
specimens
of
those
antarctic
foxes
which
they
had
already
seen
on
the
right
bank
of
the
mercy
were
found
in
them
why
there
are
nothing
but
foxes
in
this
country
cried
pencroft
when
for
the
third
time
he
drew
one
of
the
animals
out
of
the
pit
looking
at
it
in
great
disgust
he
added
beasts
which
are
good
for
nothing
yes
said
gideon
spilett
they
are
good
for
something
and
what
is
that
to
make
bait
to
attract
other
creatures
the
reporter
was
right
and
the
traps
were
henceforward
baited
with
the
foxes
carcasses
the
sailor
had
also
made
snares
from
the
long
tough
fibers
of
a
certain
plant
and
they
were
even
more
successful
than
the
traps
rarely
a
day
passed
without
some
rabbits
from
the
warren
being
caught
it
was
always
rabbit
but
neb
knew
how
to
vary
his
sauces
and
the
settlers
did
not
think
of
complaining
however
once
or
twice
in
the
second
week
of
august
the
traps
supplied
the
hunters
with
other
animals
more
useful
than
foxes
namely
several
of
those
small
wild
boars
which
had
already
been
seen
to
the
north
of
the
lake
pencroft
had
no
need
to
ask
if
these
beasts
were
eatable
he
could
see
that
by
their
resemblance
to
the
pig
of
america
and
europe
but
these
are
not
pigs
said
herbert
to
him
i
warn
you
of
that
pencroft
my
boy
replied
the
sailor
bending
over
the
trap
and
drawing
out
one
of
these
representatives
of
the
family
of
sus
by
the
little
appendage
which
served
it
as
a
tail
let
me
believe
that
these
are
pigs
why
because
that
pleases
me
are
you
very
fond
of
pig
then
pencroft
i
am
very
fond
of
pig
replied
the
sailor
particularly
of
its
feet
and
if
it
had
eight
instead
of
four
i
should
like
it
twice
as
much
as
to
the
animals
in
question
they
were
peccaries
belonging
to
one
of
the
four
species
which
are
included
in
the
family
and
they
were
also
of
the
species
of
tajacu
recognizable
by
their
deep
color
and
the
absence
of
those
long
teeth
with
which
the
mouths
of
their
congeners
are
armed
these
peccaries
generally
live
in
herds
and
it
was
probable
that
they
abounded
in
the
woody
parts
of
the
island
at
any
rate
they
were
eatable
from
head
to
foot
and
pencroft
did
not
ask
more
from
them
towards
the
15th
of
august
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
was
suddenly
moderated
by
the
wind
shifting
to
the
northwest
the
temperature
rose
some
degrees
and
the
accumulated
vapor
in
the
air
was
not
long
in
resolving
into
snow
all
the
island
was
covered
with
a
sheet
of
white
and
showed
itself
to
its
inhabitants
under
a
new
aspect
the
snow
fell
abundantly
for
several
days
and
it
soon
reached
a
thickness
of
two
feet
the
wind
also
blew
with
great
violence
and
at
the
height
of
granite
house
the
sea
could
be
heard
thundering
against
the
reefs
in
some
places
the
wind
eddying
round
the
corners
formed
the
snow
into
tall
whirling
columns
resembling
those
waterspouts
which
turn
round
on
their
base
and
which
vessels
attack
with
a
shot
from
a
gun
however
the
storm
coming
from
the
northwest
blew
across
the
island
and
the
position
of
granite
house
preserved
it
from
a
direct
attack
but
in
the
midst
of
this
snowstorm
as
terrible
as
if
it
had
been
produced
in
some
polar
country
neither
cyrus
harding
nor
his
companions
could
notwithstanding
their
wish
for
it
venture
forth
and
they
remained
shut
up
for
five
days
from
the
20th
to
the
25th
of
august
they
could
hear
the
tempest
raging
in
jacamar
wood
which
would
surely
suffer
from
it
many
of
the
trees
would
no
doubt
be
torn
up
by
the
roots
but
pencroft
consoled
himself
by
thinking
that
he
would
not
have
the
trouble
of
cutting
them
down
the
wind
is
turning
woodman
let
it
alone
he
repeated
besides
there
was
no
way
of
stopping
it
if
they
had
wished
to
do
so
how
grateful
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
then
were
to
heaven
for
having
prepared
for
them
this
solid
and
immovable
retreat
cyrus
harding
had
also
his
legitimate
share
of
thanks
but
after
all
it
was
nature
who
had
hollowed
out
this
vast
cavern
and
he
had
only
discovered
it
there
all
were
in
safety
and
the
tempest
could
not
reach
them
if
they
had
constructed
a
house
of
bricks
and
wood
on
prospect
heights
it
certainly
would
not
have
resisted
the
fury
of
this
storm
as
to
the
chimneys
it
must
have
been
absolutely
uninhabitable
for
the
sea
passing
over
the
islet
would
beat
furiously
against
it
but
here
in
granite
house
in
the
middle
of
a
solid
mass
over
which
neither
the
sea
nor
air
had
any
influence
there
was
nothing
to
fear
during
these
days
of
seclusion
the
settlers
did
not
remain
inactive
there
was
no
want
of
wood
cut
up
into
planks
in
the
storeroom
and
little
by
little
they
completed
their
furnishing
constructing
the
most
solid
of
tables
and
chairs
for
material
was
not
spared
neb
and
pencroft
were
very
proud
of
this
rather
heavy
furniture
which
they
would
not
have
changed
on
any
account
then
the
carpenters
became
basketmakers
and
they
did
not
succeed
badly
in
this
new
manufacture
at
the
point
of
the
lake
which
projected
to
the
north
they
had
discovered
an
osierbed
in
which
grew
a
large
number
of
purple
osiers
before
the
rainy
season
pencroft
and
herbert
had
cut
down
these
useful
shrubs
and
their
branches
well
prepared
could
now
be
effectively
employed
the
first
attempts
were
somewhat
crude
but
in
consequence
of
the
cleverness
and
intelligence
of
the
workmen
by
consulting
and
recalling
the
models
which
they
had
seen
and
by
emulating
each
other
the
possessions
of
the
colony
were
soon
increased
by
several
baskets
of
different
sizes
the
storeroom
was
provided
with
them
and
in
special
baskets
neb
placed
his
collection
of
rhizomes
stonepine
almonds
etc
during
the
last
week
of
the
month
of
august
the
weather
moderated
again
the
temperature
fell
a
little
and
the
tempest
abated
the
colonists
sallied
out
directly
there
was
certainly
two
feet
of
snow
on
the
shore
but
they
were
able
to
walk
without
much
difficulty
on
the
hardened
surface
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
climbed
prospect
heights
what
a
change
the
woods
which
they
had
left
green
especially
in
the
part
at
which
the
firs
predominated
had
disappeared
under
a
uniform
color
all
was
white
from
the
summit
of

to
the
shore
the

the

the

the

under

roof
of
ice
which
at
each
rising
and
ebbing
of
the
tide
broke
up
with
loud
crashes
numerous
birds
fluttered
over
the

bristling
with

might
have
said
that
the
water
escaped
by
a
monstrous
gargoyle
shaped
with
all
the
imagination
of
an
artist
of
the
renaissance
as
to
the
damage
caused
by
the
storm
in
the
forest
that
could
not
as
yet
be
ascertained
they
would
have
to
wait
till
the
snowy
covering
was
dissipated
gideon
spilett
pencroft
and
herbert
did
not
miss
this
opportunity
of
going
to
visit
their
traps
they
did
not
find
them
easily
under
the
snow
with
which
they
were
covered
they
had
also
to
be
careful
not
to
fall
into
one
or
other
of
them
which
would
have
been
both
dangerous
and
humiliating
to
be
taken
in
their
own
snares
but
happily
they
avoided
this
unpleasantness
and
found
their
traps
perfectly
intact
no
animal
had
fallen
into
them
and
yet
the
footprints
in
the
neighborhood
were
very
numerous
among
others
certain
very
clear
marks
of
claws
herbert
did
not
hesitate
to
affirm
that
some
animal
of
the
feline
species
had
passed
there
which
justified
the
engineers
opinion
that
dangerous
beasts
existed
in
lincoln
island
these
animals
doubtless
generally
lived
in
the
forests
of
the
far
west
but
pressed
by
hunger
they
had
ventured
as
far
as
prospect
heights
perhaps
they
had
smelled
out
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
now
what
are
these
feline
creatures
asked
pencroft
they
are
tigers
replied
herbert
i
thought
those
beasts
were
only
found
in
hot
countries
on
the
new
continent
replied
the
lad
they
are
found
from
mexico
to
the
pampas
of
buenos
aires
now
as
lincoln
island
is
nearly
under
the
same
latitude
as
the
provinces
of
la
plata
it
is
not
surprising
that
tigers
are
to
be
met
with
in
it
well
we
must
look
out
for
them
replied
pencroft
however
the
snow
soon
disappeared
quickly
dissolving
under
the
influence
of
the
rising
temperature
rain
fell
and
the
sheet
of
white
soon
vanished
notwithstanding
the
bad
weather
the
settlers
renewed
their
stores
of
different
things
stonepine
almonds
rhizomes
syrup
from
the
mapletree
for
the
vegetable
part
rabbits
from
the
warren
agouties
and
kangaroos
for
the
animal
part
this
necessitated
several
excursions
into
the
forest
and
they
found
that
a
great
number
of
trees
had
been
blown
down
by
the
last
hurricane
pencroft
and
neb
also
pushed
with
the
cart
as
far
as
the
vein
of
coal
and
brought
back
several
tons
of
fuel
they
saw
in
passing
that
the
pottery
kiln
had
been
severely
damaged
by
the
wind
at
least
six
feet
of
it
having
been
blown
off
at
the
same
time
as
the
coal
the
store
of
wood
was
renewed
at
granite
house
and
they
profited
by
the
current
of
the
mercy
having
again
become
free
to
float
down
several
rafts
they
could
see
that
the
cold
period
was
not
ended
a
visit
was
also
paid
to
the
chimneys
and
the
settlers
could
not
but
congratulate
themselves
on
not
having
been
living
there
during
the
hurricane
the
sea
had
left
unquestionable
traces
of
its
ravages
sweeping
over
the
islet
it
had
furiously
assailed
the
passages
half
filling
them
with
sand
while
thick
beds
of
seaweed
covered
the
rocks
while
neb
herbert
and
pencroft
hunted
or
collected
wood
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
busied
themselves
in
putting
the
chimneys
to
rights
and
they
found
the
forge
and
the
bellows
almost
unhurt
protected
as
they
had
been
from
the
first
by
the
heaps
of
sand
the
store
of
fuel
had
not
been
made
uselessly
the
settlers
had
not
done
with
the
rigorous
cold
it
is
known
that
in
the
northern
hemisphere
the
month
of
february
is
principally
distinguished
by
rapid
fallings
of
the
temperature
it
is
the
same
in
the
southern
hemisphere
and
the
end
of
the
month
of
august
which
is
the
february
of
north
america
does
not
escape
this
climatic
law
about
the
25th
after
another
change
from
snow
to
rain
the
wind
shifted
to
the
southeast
and
the
cold
became
suddenly
very
severe
according
to
the
engineers
calculation
the
mercurial
column
of
a
fahrenheit
thermometer
would
not
have
marked
less
than
eight
degrees
below
zero
and
this
intense
cold
rendered
still
more
painful
by
a
sharp
gale
lasted
for
several
days
the
colonists
were
again
shut
up
in
granite
house
and
as
it
was
necessary
to
hermetically
seal
all
the
openings
of
the
facade
only
leaving
a
narrow
passage
for
renewing
the
air
the
consumption
of
candles
was
considerable
to
economize
them
the
cavern
was
often
only
lighted
by
the
blazing
hearths
on
which
fuel
was
not
spared
several
times
one
or
other
of
the
settlers
descended
to
the
beach
in
the
midst
of
ice
which
the
waves
heaped
up
at
each
tide
but
they
soon
climbed
up
again
to
granite
house
and
it
was
not
without
pain
and
difficulty
that
their
hands
could
hold
to
the
rounds
of
the
ladder
in
consequence
of
the
intense
cold
their
fingers
felt
as
if
burned
when
they
touched
the
rounds
to
occupy
the
leisure
hours
which
the
tenants
of
granite
house
now
had
at
their
disposal
cyrus
harding
undertook
an
operation
which
could
be
performed
indoors
we
know
that
the
settlers
had
no
other
sugar
at
their
disposal
than
the
liquid
substance
which
they
drew
from
the
maple
by
making
deep
incisions
in
the
tree
they
contented
themselves
with
collecting
this
liquor
in
jars
and
employing
it
in
this
state
for
different
culinary
purposes
and
the
more
so
as
on
growing
old
this
liquid
began
to
become
white
and
to
be
of
a
syrupy
consistence
but
there
was
something
better
to
be
made
of
it
and
one
day
cyrus
harding
announced
that
they
were
going
to
turn
into
refiners
refiners
replied
pencroft
that
is
rather
a
warm
trade
i
think
very
warm
answered
the
engineer
then
it
will
be
seasonable
said
the
sailor
this
word
refining
need
not
awake
in
the
mind
thoughts
of
an
elaborate
manufactory
with
apparatus
and
numerous
workmen
no
to
crystallize
this
liquor
only
an
extremely
easy
operation
is
required
placed
on
the
fire
in
large
earthen
pots
it
was
simply
subjected
to
evaporation
and
soon
a
scum
arose
to
its
surface
as
soon
as
this
began
to
thicken
neb
carefully
removed
it
with
a
wooden
spatula
this
accelerated
the
evaporation
and
at
the
same
time
prevented
it
from
contracting
an
empyreumatic
flavor
after
boiling
for
several
hours
on
a
hot
fire
which
did
as
much
good
to
the
operators
as
the
substance
operated
upon
the
latter
was
transformed
into
a
thick
syrup
this
syrup
was
poured
into
clay
molds
previously
fabricated
in
the
kitchen
stove
and
to
which
they
had
given
various
shapes
the
next
day
this
syrup
had
become
cold
and
formed
cakes
and
tablets
this
was
sugar
of
rather
a
reddish
color
but
nearly
transparent
and
of
a
delicious
taste
the
cold
continued
to
the
middle
of
september
and
the
prisoners
in
granite
house
began
to
find
their
captivity
rather
tedious
nearly
every
day
they
attempted
sorties
which
they
could
not
prolong
they
constantly
worked
at
the
improvement
of
their
dwelling
they
talked
while
working
harding
instructed
his
companions
in
many
things
principally
explaining
to
them
the
practical
applications
of
science
the
colonists
had
no
library
at
their
disposal
but
the
engineer
was
a
book
which
was
always
at
hand
always
open
at
the
page
which
one
wanted
a
book
which
answered
all
their
questions
and
which
they
often
consulted
the
time
thus
passed
away
pleasantly
these
brave
men
not
appearing
to
have
any
fears
for
the
future
however
all
were
anxious
to
see
if
not
the
fine
season
at
least
the
cessation
of
the
insupportable
cold
if
only
they
had
been
clothed
in
a
way
to
meet
it
how
many
excursions
they
would
have
attempted
either
to
the
downs
or
to
tadorns
fens
game
would
have
been
easily
approached
and
the
chase
would
certainly
have
been
most
productive
but
cyrus
harding
considered
it
of
importance
that
no
one
should
injure
his
health
for
he
had
need
of
all
his
hands
and
his
advice
was
followed
but
it
must
be
said
that
the
one
who
was
most
impatient
of
this
imprisonment
after
pencroft
perhaps
was
top
the
faithful
dog
found
granite
house
very
narrow
he
ran
backwards
and
forwards
from
one
room
to
another
showing
in
his
way
how
weary
he
was
of
being
shut
up
harding
often
remarked
that
when
he
approached
the
dark
well
which
communicated
with
the
sea
and
of
which
the
orifice
opened
at
the
back
of
the
storeroom
top
uttered
singular
growlings
he
ran
round
and
round
this
hole
which
had
been
covered
with
a
wooden
lid
sometimes
even
he
tried
to
put
his
paws
under
the
lid
as
if
he
wished
to
raise
it
he
then
yelped
in
a
peculiar
way
which
showed
at
once
anger
and
uneasiness
the
engineer
observed
this
maneuver
several
times
what
could
there
be
in
this
abyss
to
make
such
an
impression
on
the
intelligent
animal
the
well
led
to
the
sea
that
was
certain
could
narrow
passages
spread
from
it
through
the
foundations
of
the
island
did
some
marine
monster
come
from
time
to
time
to
breathe
at
the
bottom
of
this
well
the
engineer
did
not
know
what
to
think
and
could
not
refrain
from
dreaming
of
many
strange
improbabilities
accustomed
to
go
far
into
the
regions
of
scientific
reality
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
drawn
into
the
regions
of
the
strange
and
almost
of
the
supernatural
but
yet
how
to
explain
why
top
one
of
those
sensible
dogs
who
never
waste
their
time
in
barking
at
the
moon
should
persist
in
trying
with
scent
and
hearing
to
fathom
this
abyss
if
there
was
nothing
there
to
cause
his
uneasiness
tops
conduct
puzzled
cyrus
harding
even
more
than
he
cared
to
acknowledge
to
himself
at
all
events
the
engineer
only
communicated
his
impressions
to
gideon
spilett
for
he
thought
it
useless
to
explain
to
his
companions
the
suspicions
which
arose
from
what
perhaps
was
only
tops
fancy
at
last
the
cold
ceased
there
had
been
rain
squalls
mingled
with
snow
hailstorms
gusts
of
wind
but
these
inclemencies
did
not
last
the
ice
melted
the
snow
disappeared
the
shore
the
plateau
the
banks
of
the
mercy
the
forest
again
became
practicable
this
return
of
spring
delighted
the
tenants
of
granite
house
and
they
soon
only
passed
in
it
the
hours
necessary
for
eating
and
sleeping
they
hunted
much
in
the
second
part
of
september
which
led
pencroft
to
again
entreat
for
the
firearms
which
he
asserted
had
been
promised
by
cyrus
harding
the
latter
knowing
well
that
without
special
tools
it
would
be
nearly
impossible
for
him
to
manufacture
a
gun
which
would
be
of
any
use
still
drew
back
and
put
off
the
operation
to
some
future
time
observing
in
his
usual
dry
way
that
herbert
and
spilett
had
become
very
skilful
archers
so
that
many
sorts
of
excellent
animals
agouties
kangaroos
capybaras
pigeons
bustards
wild
ducks
snipes
in
short
game
both
with
fur
and
feathers
fell
victims
to
their
arrows
and
that
consequently
they
could
wait
but
the
obstinate
sailor
would
listen
to
nothing
of
this
and
he
would
give
the
engineer
no
peace
till
he
promised
to
satisfy
his
desire
gideon
spilett
however
supported
pencroft
if
which
may
be
doubted
said
he
the
island
is
inhabited
by
wild
beasts
we
must
think
how
to
fight
with
and
exterminate
them
a
time
may
come
when
this
will
be
our
first
duty
but
at
this
period
it
was
not
the
question
of
firearms
which
occupied
harding
but
that
of
clothes
those
which
the
settlers
wore
had
passed
this
winter
but
they
would
not
last
until
next
winter
skins
of
carnivora
or
the
wool
of
ruminants
must
be
procured
at
any
price
and
since
there
were
plenty
of
musmons
it
was
agreed
to
consult
on
the
means
of
forming
a
flock
which
might
be
brought
up
for
the
use
of
the
colony
an
enclosure
for
the
domestic
animals
a
poultryyard
for
the
birds
in
a
word
to
establish
a
sort
of
farm
in
the
island
such
were
the
two
important
projects
for
the
fine
season
in
consequence
and
in
view
of
these
future
establishments
it
became
of
much
importance
that
they
should
penetrate
into
all
the
yet
unknown
parts
of
lincoln
island
that
is
to
say
through
that
thick
forest
which
extended
on
the
right
bank
of
the
mercy
from
its
mouth
to
the
extremity
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
as
well
as
on
the
whole
of
its
western
side
but
this
needed
settled
weather
and
a
month
must
pass
before
this
exploration
could
be
profitably
undertaken
they
therefore
waited
with
some
impatience
when
an
incident
occurred
which
increased
the
desire
the
settlers
had
to
visit
the
whole
of
their
domain
it
was
the
24th
of
october
on
this
day
pencroft
had
gone
to
visit
his
traps
which
he
always
kept
properly
baited
in
one
of
them
he
found
three
animals
which
would
be
very
welcome
for
the
larder
they
were
a
female
peccary
and
her
two
young
ones
pencroft
then
returned
to
granite
house
enchanted
with
his
capture
and
as
usual
he
made
a
great
show
of
his
game
come
we
shall
have
a
grand
feast
captain
he
exclaimed
and
you
too
mr
spilett
you
will
eat
some
i
shall
be
very
happy
replied
the
reporter
but
what
is
it
that
i
am
going
to
eat
sucklingpig
oh
indeed
sucklingpig
pencroft
to
hear
you
i
thought
that
you
were
bringing
back
a
young
partridge
stuffed
with
truffles
what
cried
pencroft
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
turn
up
your
nose
at
sucklingpig
no
replied
gideon
spilett
without
showing
any
enthusiasm
provided
one
doesnt
eat
too
much
thats
right
thats
right
returned
the
sailor
who
was
not
pleased
whenever
he
heard
his
chase
made
light
of
you
like
to
make
objections
seven
months
ago
when
we
landed
on
the
island
you
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
have
met
with
such
game
well
well
replied
the
reporter
man
is
never
perfect
nor
contented
now
said
pencroft
i
hope
that
neb
will
distinguish
himself
look
here
these
two
little
peccaries
are
not
more
than
three
months
old
they
will
be
as
tender
as
quails
come
along
neb
come
i
will
look
after
the
cooking
myself
and
the
sailor
followed
by
neb
entered
the
kitchen
where
they
were
soon
absorbed
in
their
culinary
labors
they
were
allowed
to
do
it
in
their
own
way
neb
therefore
prepared
a
magnificent
repastthe
two
little
peccaries
kangaroo

a
smoked
ham
stonepine
almonds
oswego

in
fact
all
the
best
that
they
had
but
among
all
the
dishes
figured
in
the
first
rank
the
savory
peccaries
at
five
oclock
dinner
was
served
in
the
diningroom
of
granite
house
the
kangaroo
soup
was
smoking
on
the
table
they
found
it
excellent
to
the
soup
succeeded
the
peccaries
which
pencroft
insisted
on
carving
himself
and
of
which
he
served
out
monstrous
portions
to
each
of
the
guests
these
sucklingpigs
were
really
delicious
and
pencroft
was
devouring
his
share
with
great
gusto
when
all
at
once
a
cry
and
an
oath
escaped
him
whats
the
matter
asked
cyrus
harding
the
matter
the
matter
is
that
i
have
just
broken
a
tooth
replied
the
sailor
what
are
there
pebbles
in
your
peccaries
said
gideon
spilett
i
suppose
so
replied
pencroft
drawing
from
his
lips
the
object
which
had
cost
him
a
grinder
it
was
not
a
pebbleit

chapter

it
was
now
exactly
seven
months
since
the
balloon
voyagers
had
been
thrown
on
lincoln
island
during
that
time
notwithstanding
the
researches
they
had
made
no
human
being
had
been
discovered
no
smoke
even
had
betrayed
the
presence
of
man
on
the
surface
of
the
island
no
vestiges
of
his
handiwork
showed
that
either
at
an
early
or
at
a
late
period
had
man
lived
there
not
only
did
it
now
appear
to
be
uninhabited
by
any
but
themselves
but
the
colonists
were
compelled
to
believe
that
it
never
had
been
inhabited
and
now
all
this
scaffolding
of
reasonings
fell
before
a
simple
ball
of
metal
found
in
the
body
of
an
inoffensive
rodent
in
fact
this
bullet
must
have
issued
from
a
firearm
and
who
but
a
human
being
could
have
used
such
a
weapon
when
pencroft
had
placed
the
bullet
on
the
table
his
companions
looked
at
it
with
intense
astonishment
all
the
consequences
likely
to
result
from
this
incident
notwithstanding
its
apparent
insignificance
immediately
took
possession
of
their
minds
the
sudden
apparition
of
a
supernatural
being
could
not
have
startled
them
more
completely
cyrus
harding
did
not
hesitate
to
give
utterance
to
the
suggestions
which
this
fact
at
once
surprising
and
unexpected
could
not
fail
to
raise
in
his
mind
he
took
the
bullet
turned
it
over
and
over
rolled
it
between
his
finger
and
thumb
then
turning
to
pencroft
he
asked
are
you
sure
that
the
peccary
wounded
by
this
bullet
was
not
more
than
three
months
old
not
more
captain
replied
pencroft
it
was
still
sucking
its
mother
when
i
found
it
in
the
trap
well
said
the
engineer
that
proves
that
within
three
months
a
gunshot
was
fired
in
lincoln
island
and
that
a
bullet
added
gideon
spilett
wounded
though
not
mortally
this
little
animal
that
is
unquestionable
said
cyrus
harding
and
these
are
the
deductions
which
must
be
drawn
from
this
incident
that
the
island
was
inhabited
before
our
arrival
or
that
men
have
landed
here
within
three
months
did
these
men
arrive
here
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
by
disembarking
on
the
shore
or
by
being
wrecked
this
point
can
only
be
cleared
up
later
as
to
what
they
were
europeans
or
malays
enemies
or
friends
of
our
race
we
cannot
possibly
guess
and
if
they
still
inhabit
the
island
or
if
they
have
left
it
we
know
not
but
these
questions
are
of
too
much
importance
to
be
allowed
to
remain
long
unsettled
no
a
hundred
times
no
a
thousand
times
no
cried
the
sailor
springing
up
from
the
table
there
are
no
other
men
than
ourselves
on
lincoln
island
by
my
faith
the
island
isnt
large
and
if
it
had
been
inhabited
we
should
have
seen
some
of
the
inhabitants
long
before
this
in
fact
the
contrary
would
be
very
astonishing
said
herbert
but
it
would
be
much
more
astonishing
i
should
think
observed
the
reporter
if
this
peccary
had
been
born
with
a
bullet
in
its
inside
at
least
said
neb
seriously
if
pencroft
has
not
had
look
here
neb
burst
out
pencroft
do
you
think
i
could
have
a
bullet
in
my
jaw
for
five
or
six
months
without
finding
it
out
where
could
it
be
hidden
he
asked
opening
his
mouth
to
show
the
twoandthirty
teeth
with
which
it
was
furnished
look
well
neb
and
if
you
find
one
hollow
tooth
in
this
set
i
will
let
you
pull
out
half
a
dozen
nebs
supposition
is
certainly
inadmissible
replied
harding
who
notwithstanding
the
gravity
of
his
thoughts
could
not
restrain
a
smile
it
is
certain
that
a
gun
has
been
fired
in
the
island
within
three
months
at
most
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
people
who
landed
on
this
coast
were
only
here
a
very
short
time
ago
or
that
they
just
touched
here
for
if
when
we
surveyed
the
island
from
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
it
had
been
inhabited
we
should
have
seen
them
or
we
should
have
been
seen
ourselves
it
is
therefore
probable
that
within
only
a
few
weeks
castaways
have
been
thrown
by
a
storm
on
some
part
of
the
coast
however
that
may
be
it
is
of
consequence
to
us
to
have
this
point
settled
i
think
that
we
should
act
with
caution
said
the
reporter
such
is
my
advice
replied
cyrus
harding
for
it
is
to
be
feared
that
malay
pirates
have
landed
on
the
island
captain
asked
the
sailor
would
it
not
be
a
good
plan
before
setting
out
to
build
a
canoe
in
which
we
could
either
ascend
the
river
or
if
we
liked
coast
round
the
inland
it
will
not
do
to
be
unprovided
your
idea
is
good
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
but
we
cannot
wait
for
that
it
would
take
at
least
a
month
to
build
a
boat
yes
a
real
boat
replied
the
sailor
but
we
do
not
want
one
for
a
sea
voyage
and
in
five
days
at
the
most
i
will
undertake
to
construct
a
canoe
fit
to
navigate
the
mercy
five
days
cried
neb
to
build
a
boat
yes
neb
a
boat
in
the
indian
fashion
of
wood
asked
the
negro
looking
still
unconvinced
of
wood
replied
pencroft
or
rather
of
bark
i
repeat
captain
that
in
five
days
the
work
will
be
finished
in
five
days
then
be
it
replied
the
engineer
but
till
that
time
we
must
be
very
watchful
said
herbert
very
watchful
indeed
my
friends
replied
harding
and
i
beg
you
to
confine
your
hunting
excursions
to
the
neighborhood
of
granite
house
the
dinner
ended
less
gaily
than
pencroft
had
hoped
so
then
the
island
was
or
had
been
inhabited
by
others
than
the
settlers
proved
as
it
was
by
the
incident
of
the
bullet
it
was
hereafter
an
unquestionable
fact
and
such
a
discovery
could
not
but
cause
great
uneasiness
among
the
colonists
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
before
sleeping
conversed
long
about
the
matter
they
asked
themselves
if
by
chance
this
incident
might
not
have
some
connection
with
the
inexplicable
way
in
which
the
engineer
had
been
saved
and
the
other
peculiar
circumstances
which
had
struck
them
at
different
times
however
cyrus
harding
after
having
discussed
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
question
ended
by
saying
in
short
would
you
like
to
know
my
opinion
my
dear
spilett
yes
cyrus
well
then
it
is
this
however
minutely
we
explore
the
island
we
shall
find
nothing
the
next
day
pencroft
set
to
work
he
did
not
mean
to
build
a
boat
with
boards
and
planking
but
simply
a
flatbottomed
canoe
which
would
be
well
suited
for
navigating
the
mercyabove
all
for
approaching
its
source
where
the
water
would
naturally
be
shallow
pieces
of
bark
fastened
one
to
the
other
would
form
a
light
boat
and
in
case
of
natural
obstacles
which
would
render
a
portage
necessary
it
would
be
easily
carried
pencroft
intended
to
secure
the
pieces
of
bark
by
means
of
nails
to
insure
the
canoe
being
watertight
it
was
first
necessary
to
select
the
trees
which
would
afford
a
strong
and
supple
bark
for
the
work
now
the
last
storm
had
brought
down
a
number
of
large
birchtrees
the
bark
of
which
would
be
perfectly
suited
for
their
purpose
some
of
these
trees
lay
on
the
ground
and
they
had
only
to
be
barked
which
was
the
most
difficult
thing
of
all
owing
to
the
imperfect
tools
which
the
settlers
possessed
however
they
overcame
all
difficulties
while
the
sailor
seconded
by
the
engineer
thus
occupied
himself
without
losing
an
hour
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
were
not
idle
they
were
made
purveyors
to
the
colony
the
reporter
could
not
but
admire
the
boy
who
had
acquired
great
skill
in
handling
the
bow
and
spear
herbert
also
showed
great
courage
and
much
of
that
presence
of
mind
which
may
justly
be
called
the
reasoning
of
bravery
these
two
companions
of
the
chase
remembering
cyrus
hardings
recommendations
did
not
go
beyond
a
radius
of
two
miles
round
granite
house
but
the
borders
of
the
forest
furnished
a
sufficient
tribute
of
agoutis
capybaras
kangaroos
peccaries
etc
and
if
the
result
from
the
traps
was
less
than
during
the
cold
still
the
warren
yielded
its
accustomed
quota
which
might
have
fed
all
the
colony
in
lincoln
island
often
during
these
excursions
herbert
talked
with
gideon
spilett
on
the
incident
of
the
bullet
and
the
deductions
which
the
engineer
drew
from
it
and
one
dayit
was
the
26th
of
octoberhe
saidbut
mr
spilett
do
you
not
think
it
very
extraordinary
that
if
any
castaways
have
landed
on
the
island
they
have
not
yet
shown
themselves
near
granite
house
very
astonishing
if
they
are
still
here
replied
the
reporter
but
not
astonishing
at
all
if
they
are
here
no
longer
so
you
think
that
these
people
have
already
quitted
the
island
returned
herbert
it
is
more
than
probable
my
boy
for
if
their
stay
was
prolonged
and
above
all
if
they
were
still
here
some
accident
would
have
at
last
betrayed
their
presence
but
if
they
were
able
to
go
away
observed
the
lad
they
could
not
have
been
castaways
no
herbert
or
at
least
they
were
what
might
be
called
provisional
castaways
it
is
very
possible
that
a
storm
may
have
driven
them
to
the
island
without
destroying
their
vessel
and
that
the
storm
over
they
went
away
again
i
must
acknowledge
one
thing
said
herbert
it
is
that
captain
harding
appears
rather
to
fear
than
desire
the
presence
of
human
beings
on
our
island
in
short
responded
the
reporter
there
are
only
malays
who
frequent
these
seas
and
those
fellows
are
ruffians
which
it
is
best
to
avoid
it
is
not
impossible
mr
spilett
said
herbert
that
some
day
or
other
we
may
find
traces
of
their
landing
i
do
not
say
no
my
boy
a
deserted
camp
the
ashes
of
a
fire
would
put
us
on
the
track
and
this
is
what
we
will
look
for
in
our
next
expedition
the
day
on
which
the
hunters
spoke
thus
they
were
in
a
part
of
the
forest
near
the
mercy
remarkable
for
its
beautiful
trees
there
among
others
rose
to
a
height
of
nearly
200
feet
above
the
ground
some
of
those
superb
coniferae
to
which
in
new
zealand
the
natives
give
the
name
of
kauris
i
have
an
idea
mr
spilett
said
herbert
if
i
were
to
climb
to
the
top
of
one
of
these
kauris
i
could
survey
the
country
for
an
immense
distance
round
the
idea
is
good
replied
the
reporter
but
could
you
climb
to
the
top
of
those
giants
i
can
at
least
try
replied
herbert
the
light
and
active
boy
then
sprang
on
the
first
branches
the
arrangement
of
which
made
the
ascent
of
the
kauri
easy
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
arrived
at
the
summit
which
emerged
from
the
immense
plain
of
verdure
from
this
elevated
situation
his
gaze
extended
over
all
the
southern
portion
of
the
island
from
claw
cape
on
the
southeast
to
reptile
end
on
the
southwest
to
the
northwest
rose
mount
franklin
which
concealed
a
great
part
of
the
horizon
but
herbert
from
the
height
of
his
observatory
could
examine
all
the
yet
unknown
portion
of
the
island
which
might
have
given
shelter
to
the
strangers
whose
presence
they
suspected
the
lad
looked
attentively
there
was
nothing
in
sight
on
the
sea
not
a
sail
neither
on
the
horizon
nor
near
the
island
however
as
the
bank
of
trees
hid
the
shore
it
was
possible
that
a
vessel
especially
if
deprived
of
her
masts
might
lie
close
to
the
land
and
thus
be
invisible
to
herbert
neither
in
the
forests
of
the
far
west
was
anything
to
be
seen
the
wood
formed
an
impenetrable
screen
measuring
several
square
miles
without
a
break
or
an
opening
it
was
impossible
even
to
follow
the
course
of
the
mercy
or
to
ascertain
in
what
part
of
the
mountain
it
took
its
source
perhaps
other
creeks
also
ran
towards
the
west
but
they
could
not
be
seen
but
at
last
if
all
indication
of
an
encampment
escaped
herberts
sight
could
he
not
even
catch
a
glimpse
of
smoke
the
faintest
trace
of
which
would
be
easily
discernible
in
the
pure
atmosphere
for
an
instant
herbert
thought
he
could
perceive
a
slight
smoke
in
the
west
but
a
more
attentive
examination
showed
that
he
was
mistaken
he
strained
his
eyes
in
every
direction
and
his
sight
was
excellent
no
decidedly
there
was
nothing
there
herbert
descended
to
the
foot
of
the
kauri
and
the
two
sportsmen
returned
to
granite
house
there
cyrus
harding
listened
to
the
lads
account
shook
his
head
and
said
nothing
it
was
very
evident
that
no
decided
opinion
could
be
pronounced
on
this
question
until
after
a
complete
exploration
of
the
island
two
days
afterthe
28th
of
octoberanother
incident
occurred
for
which
an
explanation
was
again
required
while
strolling
along
the
shore
about
two
miles
from
granite
house
herbert
and
neb
were
fortunate
enough
to
capture
a
magnificent
specimen
of
the
order
of
chelonia
it
was
a
turtle
of
the
species
midas
the
edible
green
turtle
so
called
from
the
color
both
of
its
shell
and
fat
herbert
caught
sight
of
this
turtle
as
it
was
crawling
among
the
rocks
to
reach
the
sea
help
neb
help
he
cried
neb
ran
up
what
a
fine
animal
said
neb
but
how
are
we
to
catch
it
nothing
is
easier
neb
replied
herbert
we
have
only
to
turn
the
turtle
on
its
back
and
it
cannot
possibly
get
away
take
your
spear
and
do
as
i
do
the
reptile
aware
of
danger
had
retired
between
its
carapace
and
plastron
they
no
longer
saw
its
head
or
feet
and
it
was
motionless
as
a
rock
herbert
and
neb
then
drove
their
sticks
underneath
the
animal
and
by
their
united
efforts
managed
without
difficulty
to
turn
it
on
its
back
the
turtle
which
was
three
feet
in
length
would
have
weighed
at
least
four
hundred
pounds
capital
cried
neb
this
is
something
which
will
rejoice
friend
pencrofts
heart
in
fact
the
heart
of
friend
pencroft
could
not
fail
to
be
rejoiced
for
the
flesh
of
the
turtle
which
feeds
on
wrackgrass
is
extremely
savory
at
this
moment
the
creatures
head
could
be
seen
which
was
small
flat
but
widened
behind
by
the
large
temporal
fossae
hidden
under
the
long
roof
and
now
what
shall
we
do
with
our
prize
said
neb
we
cant
drag
it
to
granite
house
leave
it
here
since
it
cannot
turn
over
replied
herbert
and
we
will
come
back
with
the
cart
to
fetch
it
that
is
the
best
plan
however
for
greater
precaution
herbert
took
the
trouble
which
neb
deemed
superfluous
to
wedge
up
the
animal
with
great
stones
after
which
the
two
hunters
returned
to
granite
house
following
the
beach
which
the
tide
had
left
uncovered
herbert
wishing
to
surprise
pencroft
said
nothing
about
the
superb
specimen
of
a
chelonian
which
they
had
turned
over
on
the
sand
but
two
hours
later
he
and
neb
returned
with
the
cart
to
the
place
where
they
had
left
it
the
superb
specimen
of
a
chelonian
was
no
longer
there
neb
and
herbert
stared
at
each
other
first
then
they
stared
about
them
it
was
just
at
this
spot
that
the
turtle
had
been
left
the
lad
even
found
the
stones
which
he
had
used
and
therefore
he
was
certain
of
not
being
mistaken
well
said
neb
these
beasts
can
turn
themselves
over
then
it
appears
so
replied
herbert
who
could
not
understand
it
at
all
and
was
gazing
at
the
stones
scattered
on
the
sand
well
pencroft
will
be
disgusted
and
captain
harding
will
perhaps
be
very
perplexed
how
to
explain
this
disappearance
thought
herbert
look
here
said
neb
who
wished
to
hide
his
illluck
we
wont
speak
about
it
on
the
contrary
neb
we
must
speak
about
it
replied
herbert
and
the
two
taking
the
cart
which
there
was
now
no
use
for
returned
to
granite
house
arrived
at
the
dockyard
where
the
engineer
and
the
sailor
were
working
together
herbert
recounted
what
had
happened
oh
the
stupids
cried
the
sailor
to
have
let
at
least
fifty
meals
escape
but
pencroft
replied
neb
it
wasnt
our
fault
that
the
beast
got
away
as
i
tell
you
we
had
turned
it
over
on
its
back
then
you
didnt
turn
it
over
enough
returned
the
obstinate
sailor
not
enough
cried
herbert
and
he
told
how
he
had
taken
care
to
wedge
up
the
turtle
with
stones
it
is
a
miracle
then
replied
pencroft
i
thought
captain
said
herbert
that
turtles
once
placed
on
their
backs
could
not
regain
their
feet
especially
when
they
are
of
a
large
size
that
is
true
my
boy
replied
cyrus
harding
then
how
did
it
manage
at
what
distance
from
the
sea
did
you
leave
this
turtle
asked
the
engineer
who
having
suspended
his
work
was
reflecting
on
this
incident
fifteen
feet
at
the
most
replied
herbert
and
the
tide
was
low
at
the
time
yes
captain
well
replied
the
engineer
what
the
turtle
could
not
do
on
the
sand
it
might
have
been
able
to
do
in
the
water
it
turned
over
when
the
tide
overtook
it
and
then
quietly
returned
to
the
deep
sea
oh
what
stupids
we
were
cried
neb
that
is
precisely
what
i
had
the
honor
of
telling
you
before
returned
the
sailor
cyrus
harding
had
given
this
explanation
which
no
doubt
was
admissible
but
was
he
himself
convinced
of
the
accuracy
of
this
explanation
it
cannot
be
said
that
he
was
chapter
2
on
the
9th
of
october
the
bark
canoe
was
entirely
finished
pencroft
had
kept
his
promise
and
a
light
boat
the
shell
of
which
was
joined
together
by
the
flexible
twigs
of
the
crejimba
had
been
constructed
in
five
days
a
seat
in
the
stern
a
second
seat
in
the
middle
to
preserve
the
equilibrium
a
third
seat
in
the
bows
rowlocks
for
the
two
oars
a
scull
to
steer
with
completed
the
little
craft
which
was
twelve
feet
long
and
did
not
weigh
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
the
operation
of
launching
it
was
extremely
simple
the
canoe
was
carried
to
the
beach
and
laid
on
the
sand
before
granite
house
and
the
rising
tide
floated
it
pencroft
who
leaped
in
directly
maneuvered
it
with
the
scull
and
declared
it
to
be
just
the
thing
for
the
purpose
to
which
they
wished
to
put
it
hurrah
cried
the
sailor
who
did
not
disdain
to
celebrate
thus
his
own
triumph
with
this
we
could
go
round
the
world
asked
gideon
spilett
no
the
island
some
stones
for
ballast
a
mast
and
a
sail
which
the
captain
will
make
for
us
some
day
and
we
shall
go
splendidly
well
captainand
you
mr
spilett
and
you
herbert
and
you
nebarent
you
coming
to
try
our
new
vessel
come
along
we
must
see
if
it
will
carry
all
five
of
us
this
was
certainly
a
trial
which
ought
to
be
made
pencroft
soon
brought
the
canoe
to
the
shore
by
a
narrow
passage
among
the
rocks
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
make
a
trial
of
the
boat
that
day
by
following
the
shore
as
far
as
the
first
point
at
which
the
rocks
of
the
south
ended
as
they
embarked
neb
cried
but
your
boat
leaks
rather
pencroft
thats
nothing
neb
replied
the
sailor
the
wood
will
get
seasoned
in
two
days
there
wont
be
a
single
leak
and
our
boat
will
have
no
more
water
in
her
than
there
is
in
the
stomach
of
a
drunkard
jump
in
they
were
soon
all
seated
and
pencroft
shoved
off
the
weather
was
magnificent
the
sea
as
calm
as
if
its
waters
were
contained
within
the
narrow
limits
of
a
lake
thus
the
boat
could
proceed
with
as
much
security
as
if
it
was
ascending
the
tranquil
current
of
the
mercy
neb
took
one
of
the
oars
herbert
the
other
and
pencroft
remained
in
the
stern
in
order
to
use
the
scull
the
sailor
first
crossed
the
channel
and
steered
close
to
the
southern
point
of
the
islet
a
light
breeze
blew
from
the
south
no
roughness
was
found
either
in
the
channel
or
the
green
sea
a
long
swell
which
the
canoe
scarcely
felt
as
it
was
heavily
laden
rolled
regularly
over
the
surface
of
the
water
they
pulled
out
about
half
a
mile
distant
from
the
shore
that
they
might
have
a
good
view
of
mount
franklin
pencroft
afterwards
returned
towards
the
mouth
of
the
river
the
boat
then
skirted
the
shore
which
extending
to
the
extreme
point
hid
all
tadorns
fens
this
point
of
which
the
distance
was
increased
by
the
irregularity
of
the
coast
was
nearly
three
miles
from
the
mercy
the
settlers
resolved
to
go
to
its
extremity
and
only
go
beyond
it
as
much
as
was
necessary
to
take
a
rapid
survey
of
the
coast
as
far
as
claw
cape
the
canoe
followed
the
windings
of
the
shore
avoiding
the
rocks
which
fringed
it
and
which
the
rising
tide
began
to
cover
the
cliff
gradually
sloped
away
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
to
the
point
this
was
formed
of
granite
rocks
capriciously
distributed
very
different
from
the
cliff
at
prospect
heights
and
of
an
extremely
wild
aspect
it
might
have
been
said
that
an
immense
cartload
of
rocks
had
been
emptied
out
there
there
was
no
vegetation
on
this
sharp
promontory
which
projected
two
miles
from
the
forest
and
it
thus
represented
a
giants
arm
stretched
out
from
a
leafy
sleeve
the
canoe
impelled
by
the
two
oars
advanced
without
difficulty
gideon
spilett
pencil
in
one
hand
and
notebook
in
the
other
sketched
the
coast
in
bold
strokes
neb
herbert
and
pencroft
chatted
while
examining
this
part
of
their
domain
which
was
new
to
them
and
in
proportion
as
the
canoe
proceeded
towards
the
south
the
two
mandible
capes
appeared
to
move
and
surround
union
bay
more
closely
as
to
cyrus
harding
he
did
not
speak
he
simply
gazed
and
by
the
mistrust
which
his
look
expressed
it
appeared
that
he
was
examining
some
strange
country
in
the
meantime
after
a
voyage
of
threequarters
of
an
hour
the
canoe
reached
the
extremity
of
the
point
and
pencroft
was
preparing
to
return
when
herbert
rising
pointed
to
a
black
object
saying
what
do
i
see
down
there
on
the
beach
all
eyes
turned
towards
the
point
indicated
why
said
the
reporter
there
is
something
it
looks
like
part
of
a
wreck
half
buried
in
the
sand
ah
cried
pencroft
i
see
what
it
is
what
asked
neb
barrels
barrels
which
perhaps
are
full
replied
the
sailor
pull
to
the
shore
pencroft
said
cyrus
a
few
strokes
of
the
oar
brought
the
canoe
into
a
little
creek
and
its
passengers
leaped
on
shore
pencroft
was
not
mistaken
two
barrels
were
there
half
buried
in
the
sand
but
still
firmly
attached
to
a
large
chest
which
sustained
by
them
had
floated
to
the
moment
when
it
stranded
on
the
beach
there
has
been
a
wreck
then
in
some
part
of
the
island
said
herbert
evidently
replied
spilett
but
whats
in
this
chest
cried
pencroft
with
very
natural
impatience
whats
in
this
chest
it
is
shut
up
and
nothing
to
open
it
with
well
perhaps
a
stone
and
the
sailor
raising
a
heavy
block
was
about
to
break
in
one
of
the
sides
of
the
chest
when
the
engineer
arrested
his
hand
pencroft
said
he
can
you
restrain
your
impatience
for
one
hour
only
but
captain
just
think
perhaps
there
is
everything
we
want
in
there
we
shall
find
that
out
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
but
trust
to
me
and
do
not
break
the
chest
which
may
be
useful
to
us
we
must
convey
it
to
granite
house
where
we
can
open
it
easily
and
without
breaking
it
it
is
quite
prepared
for
a
voyage
and
since
it
has
floated
here
it
may
just
as
well
float
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
you
are
right
captain
and
i
was
wrong
as
usual
replied
the
sailor
the
engineers
advice
was
good
in
fact
the
canoe
probably
would
not
have
been
able
to
contain
the
articles
possibly
enclosed
in
the
chest
which
doubtless
was
heavy
since
two
empty
barrels
were
required
to
buoy
it
up
it
was
therefore
much
better
to
tow
it
to
the
beach
at
granite
house
and
now
whence
had
this
chest
come
that
was
the
important
question
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
looked
attentively
around
them
and
examined
the
shore
for
several
hundred
steps
no
other
articles
or
pieces
of
wreck
could
be
found
herbert
and
neb
climbed
a
high
rock
to
survey
the
sea
but
there
was
nothing
in
sightneither
a
dismasted
vessel
nor
a
ship
under
sail
however
there
was
no
doubt
that
there
had
been
a
wreck
perhaps
this
incident
was
connected
with
that
of
the
bullet
perhaps
strangers
had
landed
on
another
part
of
the
island
perhaps
they
were
still
there
but
the
thought
which
came
naturally
to
the
settlers
was
that
these
strangers
could
not
be
malay
pirates
for
the
chest
was
evidently
of
american
or
european
make
all
the
party
returned
to
the
chest
which
was
of
an
unusually
large
size
it
was
made
of
oak
wood
very
carefully
closed
and
covered
with
a
thick
hide
which
was
secured
by
copper
nails
the
two
great
barrels
hermetically
sealed
but
which
sounded
hollow
and
empty
were
fastened
to
its
sides
by
strong
ropes
knotted
with
a
skill
which
pencroft
directly
pronounced
sailors
alone
could
exhibit
it
appeared
to
be
in
a
perfect
state
of
preservation
which
was
explained
by
the
fact
that
it
had
stranded
on
a
sandy
beach
and
not
among
rocks
they
had
no
doubt
whatever
on
examining
it
carefully
that
it
had
not
been
long
in
the
water
and
that
its
arrival
on
this
coast
was
recent
the
water
did
not
appear
to
have
penetrated
to
the
inside
and
the
articles
which
it
contained
were
no
doubt
uninjured
it
was
evident
that
this
chest
had
been
thrown
overboard
from
some
dismasted
vessel
driven
towards
the
island
and
that
in
the
hope
that
it
would
reach
the
land
where
they
might
afterwards
find
it
the
passengers
had
taken
the
precaution
to
buoy
it
up
by
means
of
this
floating
apparatus
we
will
tow
this
chest
to
granite
house
said
the
engineer
where
we
can
make
an
inventory
of
its
contents
then
if
we
discover
any
of
the
survivors
from
the
supposed
wreck
we
can
return
it
to
those
to
whom
it
belongs
if
we
find
no
one
we
will
keep
it
for
ourselves
cried
pencroft
but
what
in
the
world
can
there
be
in
it
the
sea
was
already
approaching
the
chest
and
the
high
tide
would
evidently
float
it
one
of
the
ropes
which
fastened
the
barrels
was
partly
unlashed
and
used
as
a
cable
to
unite
the
floating
apparatus
with
the
canoe
pencroft
and
neb
then
dug
away
the
sand
with
their
oars
so
as
to
facilitate
the
moving
of
the
chest
towing
which
the
boat
soon
began
to
double
the
point
to
which
the
name
of
flotsam
point
was
given
the
chest
was
heavy
and
the
barrels
were
scarcely
sufficient
to
keep
it
above
water
the
sailor
also
feared
every
instant
that
it
would
get
loose
and
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
happily
his
fears
were
not
realized
and
an
hour
and
a
half
after
they
set
outall
that
time
had
been
taken
up
in
going
a
distance
of
three
milesthe
boat
touched
the
beach
below
granite
house
canoe
and
chest
were
then
hauled
up
on
the
sands
and
as
the
tide
was
then
going
out
they
were
soon
left
high
and
dry
neb
hurrying
home
brought
back
some
tools
with
which
to
open
the
chest
in
such
a
way
that
it
might
be
injured
as
little
as
possible
and
they
proceeded
to
its
inventory
pencroft
did
not
try
to
hide
that
he
was
greatly
excited
the
sailor
began
by
detaching
the
two
barrels
which
being
in
good
condition
would
of
course
be
of
use
then
the
locks
were
forced
with
a
cold
chisel
and
hammer
and
the
lid
thrown
back
a
second
casing
of
zinc
lined
the
interior
of
the
chest
which
had
been
evidently
arranged
that
the
articles
which
it
enclosed
might
under
any
circumstances
be
sheltered
from
damp
oh
cried
neb
suppose
its
jam
i
hope
not
replied
the
reporter
if
only
there
was
said
the
sailor
in
a
low
voice
what
asked
neb
who
overheard
him
nothing
the
covering
of
zinc
was
torn
off
and
thrown
back
over
the
sides
of
the
chest
and
by
degrees
numerous
articles
of
very
varied
character
were
produced
and
strewn
about
on
the
sand
at
each
new
object
pencroft
uttered
fresh
hurrahs
herbert
clapped
his
hands
and
neb
danced
up
and
down
there
were
books
which
made
herbert
wild
with
joy
and
cooking
utensils
which
neb
covered
with
kisses
in
short
the
colonists
had
reason
to
be
extremely
satisfied

said
the

after

nothing

wanting
indeed
murmured
cyrus
harding
thoughtfully
and
for
a
certainty
added
herbert
the
vessel
which
carried
this
chest
and
its
owner
was
not
a
malay
pirate
unless
said
pencroft
the
owner
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
pirates
that
is
not
admissible
replied
the
reporter
it
is
more
probable
that
an
american
or
european
vessel
has
been
driven
into
this
quarter
and
that
her
passengers
wishing
to
save
necessaries
at
least
prepared
this
chest
and
threw
it
overboard
is
that
your
opinion
captain
asked
herbert
yes
my
boy
replied
the
engineer
that
may
have
been
the
case
it
is
possible
that
at
the
moment
or
in
expectation
of
a
wreck
they
collected
into
this
chest
different
articles
of
the
greatest
use
in
hopes
of
finding
it
again
on
the
coast
even
the
photographic
box
exclaimed
the
sailor
incredulously
as
to
that
apparatus
replied
harding
i
do
not
quite
see
the
use
of
it
and
a
more
complete
supply
of
clothes
or
more
abundant
ammunition
would
have
been
more
valuable
to
us
as
well
as
to
any
other
castaways
but
isnt
there
any
mark
or
direction
on
these
instruments
tools
or
books
which
would
tell
us
something
about
them
asked
gideon
spilett
that
might
be
ascertained
each
article
was
carefully
examined
especially
the
books
instruments
and
weapons
neither
the
weapons
nor
the
instruments
contrary
to
the
usual
custom
bore
the
name
of
the
maker
they
were
besides
in
a
perfect
state
and
did
not
appear
to
have
been
used
the
same
peculiarity
marked
the
tools
and
utensils
all
were
new
which
proved
that
the
articles
had
not
been
taken
by
chance
and
thrown
into
the
chest
but
on
the
contrary
that
the
choice
of
things
had
been
well
considered
and
arranged
with
care
this
was
also
indicated
by
the
second
case
of
metal
which
had
preserved
them
from
damp
and
which
could
not
have
been
soldered
in
a
moment
of
haste
as
to
the
dictionaries
of
natural
science
and
polynesian
idioms
both
were
english
but
they
neither
bore
the
name
of
the
publisher
nor
the
date
of
publication
the
same
with
the
bible
printed
in
english
in
quarto
remarkable
from
a
typographic
point
of
view
and
which
appeared
to
have
been
often
used
the
atlas
was
a
magnificent
work
comprising
maps
of
every
country
in
the
world
and
several
planispheres
arranged
upon
mercators
projection
and
of
which
the
nomenclature
was
in
frenchbut
which
also
bore
neither
date
nor
name
of
publisher
there
was
nothing
therefore
on
these
different
articles
by
which
they
could
be
traced
and
nothing
consequently
of
a
nature
to
show
the
nationality
of
the
vessel
which
must
have
recently
passed
these
shores
but
wherever
the
chest
might
have
come
from
it
was
a
treasure
to
the
settlers
on
lincoln
island
till
then
by
making
use
of
the
productions
of
nature
they
had
created
everything
for
themselves
and
thanks
to
their
intelligence
they
had
managed
without
difficulty
but
did
it
not
appear
as
if
providence
had
wished
to
reward
them
by
sending
them
these
productions
of
human
industry
their
thanks
rose
unanimously
to
heaven
however
one
of
them
was
not
quite
satisfied
it
was
pencroft
it
appeared
that
the
chest
did
not
contain
something
which
he
evidently
held
in
great
esteem
for
in
proportion
as
they
approached
the
bottom
of
the
box
his
hurrahs
diminished
in
heartiness
and
the
inventory
finished
he
was
heard
to
mutter
these
wordsthats
all
very
fine
but
you
can
see
that
there
is
nothing
for
me
in
that
box
this
led
neb
to
say
why
friend
pencroft
what
more
do
you
expect
half
a
pound
of
tobacco
replied
pencroft
seriously
and
nothing
would
have
been
wanting
to
complete
my
happiness
no
one
could
help
laughing
at
this
speech
of
the
sailors
but
the
result
of
this
discovery
of
the
chest
was
that
it
was
now
more
than
ever
necessary
to
explore
the
island
thoroughly
it
was
therefore
agreed
that
the
next
morning
at
break
of
day
they
should
set
out
by
ascending
the
mercy
so
as
to
reach
the
western
shore
if
any
castaways
had
landed
on
the
coast
it
was
to
be
feared
they
were
without
resources
and
it
was
therefore
the
more
necessary
to
carry
help
to
them
without
delay
during
the
day
the
different
articles
were
carried
to
granite
house
where
they
were
methodically
arranged
in
the
great
hall
this
daythe
29th
of
octoberhappened
to
be
a
sunday
and
before
going
to
bed
herbert
asked
the
engineer
if
he
would
not
read
them
something
from
the
gospel
willingly
replied
cyrus
harding
he
took
the
sacred
volume
and
was
about
to
open
it
when
pencroft
stopped
him
sayingcaptain
i
am
superstitious
open
at
random
and
read
the
first
verse
which
your
eye
falls
upon
we
will
see
if
it
applies
to
our
situation
cyrus
harding
smiled
at
the
sailors
idea
and
yielding
to
his
wish
he
opened
exactly
at
a
place
where
the
leaves
were
separated
by
a
marker
immediately
his
eyes
were
attracted
by
a
cross
which
made
with
a
pencil
was
placed
against
the
eighth
verse
of
the
seventh
chapter
of
the
gospel
of
st
matthew
he
read
the
verse
which
was
this
for
every
one
that
asketh
receiveth
and
he
that
seeketh
findeth

the
next
day
the
30th
of
october
all
was
ready
for
the
proposed
exploring
expedition
which
recent
events
had
rendered
so
necessary
in
fact
things
had
so
come
about
that
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
no
longer
needed
help
for
themselves
but
were
even
able
to
carry
it
to
others
it
was
therefore
agreed
that
they
should
ascend
the
mercy
as
far
as
the
river
was
navigable
a
great
part
of
the
distance
would
thus
be
traversed
without
fatigue
and
the
explorers
could
transport
their
provisions
and
arms
to
an
advanced
point
in
the
west
of
the
island
it
was
necessary
to
think
not
only
of
the
things
which
they
should
take
with
them
but
also
of
those
which
they
might
have
by
chance
to
bring
back
to
granite
house
if
there
had
been
a
wreck
on
the
coast
as
was
supposed
there
would
be
many
things
cast
up
which
would
be
lawfully
their
prizes
in
the
event
of
this
the
cart
would
have
been
of
more
use
than
the
light
canoe
but
it
was
heavy
and
clumsy
to
drag
and
therefore
more
difficult
to
use
this
led
pencroft
to
express
his
regret
that
the
chest
had
not
contained
besides
his
halfpound
of
tobacco
a
pair
of
strong
new
jersey
horses
which
would
have
been
very
useful
to
the
colony
the
provisions
which
neb
had
already
packed
up
consisted
of
a
store
of
meat
and
of
several
gallons
of
beer
that
is
to
say
enough
to
sustain
them
for
three
days
the
time
which
harding
assigned
for
the
expedition
they
hoped
besides
to
supply
themselves
on
the
road
and
neb
took
care
not
to
forget
the
portable
stove
the
only
tools
the
settlers
took
were
the
two
woodmens
axes
which
they
could
use
to
cut
a
path
through
the
thick
forests
as
also
the
instruments
the
telescope
and
pocketcompass
for
weapons
they
selected
the
two
flintlock
guns
which
were
likely
to
be
more
useful
to
them
than
the
percussion
fowlingpieces
the
first
only
requiring
flints
which
could
be
easily
replaced
and
the
latter
needing
fulminating
caps
a
frequent
use
of
which
would
soon
exhaust
their
limited
stock
however
they
took
also
one
of
the
carbines
and
some
cartridges
as
to
the
powder
of
which
there
was
about
fifty
pounds
in
the
barrel
a
small
supply
of
it
had
to
be
taken
but
the
engineer
hoped
to
manufacture
an
explosive
substance
which
would
allow
them
to
husband
it
to
the
firearms
were
added
the
five
cutlasses
well
sheathed
in
leather
and
thus
supplied
the
settlers
could
venture
into
the
vast
forest
with
some
chance
of
success
it
is
useless
to
add
that
pencroft
herbert
and
neb
thus
armed
were
at
the
summit
of
their
happiness
although
cyrus
harding
made
them
promise
not
to
fire
a
shot
unless
it
was
necessary
at
six
in
the
morning
the
canoe
put
off
from
the
shore
all
had
embarked
including
top
and
they
proceeded
to
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
the
tide
had
begun
to
come
up
half
an
hour
before
for
several
hours
therefore
there
would
be
a
current
which
it
was
well
to
profit
by
for
later
the
ebb
would
make
it
difficult
to
ascend
the
river
the
tide
was
already
strong
for
in
three
days
the
moon
would
be
full
and
it
was
enough
to
keep
the
boat
in
the
center
of
the
current
where
it
floated
swiftly
along
between
the
high
banks
without
its
being
necessary
to
increase
its
speed
by
the
aid
of
the
oars
in
a
few
minutes
the
explorers
arrived
at
the
angle
formed
by
the
mercy
and
exactly
at
the
place
where
seven
months
before
pencroft
had
made
his
first
raft
of
wood
after
this
sudden
angle
the
river
widened
and
flowed
under
the
shade
of
great
evergreen
firs
the
aspect
of
the
banks
was
magnificent
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
could
not
but
admire
the
lovely
effects
so
easily
produced
by
nature
with
water
and
trees
as
they
advanced
the
forest
element
diminished
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
grew
magnificent
specimens
of
the
ulmaceae
tribe
the
precious
elm
so
valuable
to
builders
and
which
withstands
well
the
action
of
water
then
there
were
numerous
groups
belonging
to
the
same
family
among
others
one
in
particular
the
fruit
of
which
produces
a
very
useful
oil
further
on
herbert
remarked
the
lardizabala
a
twining
shrub
which
when
bruised
in
water
furnishes
excellent
cordage
and
two
or
three
ebony
trees
of
a
beautiful
black
crossed
with
capricious
veins
from
time
to
time
in
certain
places
where
the
landing
was
easy
the
canoe
was
stopped
when
gideon
spilett
herbert
and
pencroft
their
guns
in
their
hands
and
preceded
by
top
jumped
on
shore
without
expecting
game
some
useful
plant
might
be
met
with
and
the
young
naturalist
was
delighted
with
discovering
a
sort
of
wild
spinach
belonging
to
the
order
of
chenopodiaceae
and
numerous
specimens
of
cruciferae
belonging
to
the
cabbage
tribe
which
it
would
certainly
be
possible
to
cultivate
by
transplanting
there
were
cresses
horseradish
turnips
and
lastly
little
branching
hairy
stalks
scarcely
more
than
three
feet
high
which
produced
brownish
grains
do
you
know
what
this
plant
is
asked
herbert
of
the
sailor
tobacco
cried
pencroft
who
evidently
had
never
seen
his
favorite
plant
except
in
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
no
pencroft
replied
herbert
this
is
not
tobacco
it
is
mustard
mustard
be
hanged
returned
the
sailor
but
if
by
chance
you
happen
to
come
across
a
tobaccoplant
my
boy
pray
dont
scorn
that
we
shall
find
it
some
day
said
gideon
spilett
well
exclaimed
pencroft
when
that
day
comes
i
do
not
know
what
more
will
be
wanting
in
our
island
these
different
plants
which
had
been
carefully
rooted
up
were
carried
to
the
canoe
where
cyrus
harding
had
remained
buried
in
thought
the
reporter
herbert
and
pencroft
in
this
manner
frequently
disembarked
sometimes
on
the
right
bank
sometimes
on
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
the
latter
was
less
abrupt
but
the
former
more
wooded
the
engineer
ascertained
by
consulting
his
pocketcompass
that
the
direction
of
the
river
from
the
first
turn
was
obviously
southwest
and
northeast
and
nearly
straight
for
a
length
of
about
three
miles
but
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
this
direction
changed
beyond
that
point
and
that
the
mercy
continued
to
the
northwest
towards
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
among
which
the
river
rose
during
one
of
these
excursions
gideon
spilett
managed
to
get
hold
of
two
couples
of
living
gallinaceae
they
were
birds
with
long
thin
beaks
lengthened
necks
short
wings
and
without
any
appearance
of
a
tail
herbert
rightly
gave
them
the
name
of
tinamous
and
it
was
resolved
that
they
should
be
the
first
tenants
of
their
future
poultryyard
but
till
then
the
guns
had
not
spoken
and
the
first
report
which
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
forest
of
the
far
west
was
provoked
by
the
appearance
of
a
beautiful
bird
resembling
the
kingfisher
i
recognize
him
cried
pencroft
and
it
seemed
as
if
his
gun
went
off
by
itself
what
do
you
recognize
asked
the
reporter
the
bird
which
escaped
us
on
our
first
excursion
and
from
which
we
gave
the
name
to
that
part
of
the
forest
a
jacamar
cried
herbert
it
was
indeed
a
jacamar
of
which
the
plumage
shines
with
a
metallic
luster
a
shot
brought
it
to
the
ground
and
top
carried
it
to
the
canoe
at
the
same
time
half
a
dozen
lories
were
brought
down
the
lory
is
of
the
size
of
a
pigeon
the
plumage
dashed
with
green
part
of
the
wings
crimson
and
its
crest
bordered
with
white
to
the
young
boy
belonged
the
honor
of
this
shot
and
he
was
proud
enough
of
it
lories
are
better
food
than
the
jacamar
the
flesh
of
which
is
rather
tough
but
it
was
difficult
to
persuade
pencroft
that
he
had
not
killed
the
king
of
eatable
birds
it
was
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
when
the
canoe
reached
a
second
angle
of
the
mercy
nearly
five
miles
from
its
mouth
here
a
halt
was
made
for
breakfast
under
the
shade
of
some
splendid
trees
the
river
still
measured
from
sixty
to
seventy
feet
in
breadth
and
its
bed
from
five
to
six
feet
in
depth
the
engineer
had
observed
that
it
was
increased
by
numerous
affluents
but
they
were
unnavigable
being
simply
little
streams
as
to
the
forest
including
jacamar
wood
as
well
as
the
forests
of
the
far
west
it
extended
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
in
no
place
either
in
the
depths
of
the
forests
or
under
the
trees
on
the
banks
of
the
mercy
was
the
presence
of
man
revealed
the
explorers
could
not
discover
one
suspicious
trace
it
was
evident
that
the
woodmans
axe
had
never
touched
these
trees
that
the
pioneers
knife
had
never
severed
the
creepers
hanging
from
one
trunk
to
another
in
the
midst
of
tangled
brushwood
and
long
grass
if
castaways
had
landed
on
the
island
they
could
not
have
yet
quitted
the
shore
and
it
was
not
in
the
woods
that
the
survivors
of
the
supposed
shipwreck
should
be
sought
the
engineer
therefore
manifested
some
impatience
to
reach
the
western
coast
of
lincoln
island
which
was
at
least
five
miles
distant
according
to
his
estimation
the
voyage
was
continued
and
as
the
mercy
appeared
to
flow
not
towards
the
shore
but
rather
towards
mount
franklin
it
was
decided
that
they
should
use
the
boat
as
long
as
there
was
enough
water
under
its
keel
to
float
it
it
was
both
fatigue
spared
and
time
gained
for
they
would
have
been
obliged
to
cut
a
path
through
the
thick
wood
with
their
axes
but
soon
the
flow
completely
failed
them
either
the
tide
was
going
down
and
it
was
about
the
hour
or
it
could
no
longer
be
felt
at
this
distance
from
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
they
had
therefore
to
make
use
of
the
oars
herbert
and
neb
each
took
one
and
pencroft
took
the
scull
the
forest
soon
became
less
dense
the
trees
grew
further
apart
and
often
quite
isolated
but
the
further
they
were
from
each
other
the
more
magnificent
they
appeared
profiting
as
they
did
by
the
free
pure
air
which
circulated
around
them
what
splendid
specimens
of
the
flora
of
this
latitude
certainly
their
presence
would
have
been
enough
for
a
botanist
to
name
without
hesitation
the
parallel
which
traversed
lincoln
island
eucalypti
cried
herbert
they
were
in
fact
those
splendid
trees
the
giants
of
the
extratropical
zone
the
congeners
of
the
australian
and
new
zealand
eucalyptus
both
situated
under
the
same
latitude
as
lincoln
island
some
rose
to
a
height
of
two
hundred
feet
their
trunks
at
the
base
measured
twenty
feet
in
circumference
and
their
bark
was
covered
by
a
network
of
farrows
containing
a
red
sweetsmelling
gum
nothing
is
more
wonderful
or
more
singular
than
those
enormous
specimens
of
the
order
of
the
myrtaceae
with
their
leaves
placed
vertically
and
not
horizontally
so
that
an
edge
and
not
a
surface
looks
upwards
the
effect
being
that
the
suns
rays
penetrate
more
freely
among
the
trees
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
eucalypti
was
carpeted
with
grass
and
from
the
bushes
escaped
flights
of
little
birds
which
glittered
in
the
sunlight
like
winged
rubies
these
are
something
like
trees
cried
neb
but
are
they
good
for
anything
pooh
replied
pencroft
of
course
there
are
vegetable
giants
as
well
as
human
giants
and
they
are
no
good
except
to
show
themselves
at
fairs
i
think
that
you
are
mistaken
pencroft
replied
gideon
spilett
and
that
the
wood
of
the
eucalyptus
has
begun
to
be
very
advantageously
employed
in
cabinetmaking
and
i
may
add
said
herbert
that
the
eucalyptus
belongs
to
a
family
which
comprises
many
useful
members
the
guavatree
from
whose
fruit
guava
jelly
is
made
the
clovetree
which
produces
the
spice
the
pomegranatetree
which
bears
pomegranates
the
eugeacia
cauliflora
the
fruit
of
which
is
used
in
making
a
tolerable
wine
the
ugui
myrtle
which
contains
an
excellent
alcoholic
liquor
the
caryophyllus
myrtle
of
which
the
bark
forms
an
esteemed
cinnamon
the
eugenia
pimenta
from
whence
comes
jamaica
pepper
the
common
myrtle
from
whose
buds
and
berries
spice
is
sometimes
made
the
eucalyptus
manifera
which
yields
a
sweet
sort
of
manna
the
guinea
eucalyptus
the
sap
of
which
is
transformed
into
beer
by
fermentation
in
short
all
those
trees
known
under
the
name
of
gumtrees
or
ironbark
trees
in
australia
belong
to
this
family
of
the
myrtaceae
which
contains
fortysix
genera
and
thirteen
hundred
species
the
lad
was
allowed
to
run
on
and
he
delivered
his
little
botanical
lecture
with
great
animation
cyrus
harding
listened
smiling
and
pencroft
with
an
indescribable
feeling
of
pride
very
good
herbert
replied
pencroft
but
i
could
swear
that
all
those
useful
specimens
you
have
just
told
us
about
are
none
of
them
giants
like
these
that
is
true
pencroft
that
supports
what
i
said
returned
the
sailor
namely
that
these
giants
are
good
for
nothing
there
you
are
wrong
pencroft
said
the
engineer
these
gigantic
eucalypti
which
shelter
us
are
good
for
something
and
what
is
that
to
render
the
countries
which
they
inhabit
healthy
do
you
know
what
they
are
called
in
australia
and
new
zealand
no
captain
they
are
called
fever
trees
because
they
give
fevers
no
because
they
prevent
them
good
i
must
note
that
said
the
reporter
note
it
then
my
dear
spilett
for
it
appears
proved
that
the
presence
of
the
eucalyptus
is
enough
to
neutralize
miasmas
this
natural
antidote
has
been
tried
in
certain
countries
in
the
middle
of
europe
and
the
north
of
africa
where
the
soil
was
absolutely
unhealthy
and
the
sanitary
condition
of
the
inhabitants
has
been
gradually
ameliorated
no
more
intermittent
fevers
prevail
in
the
regions
now
covered
with
forests
of
the
myrtaceae
this
fact
is
now
beyond
doubt
and
it
is
a
happy
circumstance
for
us
settlers
in
lincoln
island
ah
what
an
island
what
a
blessed
island
cried
pencroft
i
tell
you
it
wants
nothingunless
it
is
that
will
come
pencroft
that
will
be
found
replied
the
engineer
but
now
we
must
continue
our
voyage
and
push
on
as
far
as
the
river
will
carry
our
boat
the
exploration
was
therefore
continued
for
another
two
miles
in
the
midst
of
country
covered
with
eucalypti
which
predominated
in
the
woods
of
this
portion
of
the
island
the
space
which
they
occupied
extended
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
on
each
side
of
the
mercy
which
wound
along
between
high
green
banks
the
bed
was
often
obstructed
by
long
weeds
and
even
by
pointed
rocks
which
rendered
the
navigation
very
difficult
the
action
of
the
oars
was
prevented
and
pencroft
was
obliged
to
push
with
a
pole
they
found
also
that
the
water
was
becoming
shallower
and
shallower
and
that
the
canoe
must
soon
stop
the
sun
was
already
sinking
towards
the
horizon
and
the
trees
threw
long
shadows
on
the
ground
cyrus
harding
seeing
that
he
could
not
hope
to
reach
the
western
coast
of
the
island
in
one
journey
resolved
to
camp
at
the
place
where
any
further
navigation
was
prevented
by
want
of
water
he
calculated
that
they
were
still
five
or
six
miles
from
the
coast
and
this
distance
was
too
great
for
them
to
attempt
during
the
night
in
the
midst
of
unknown
woods
the
boat
was
pushed
on
through
the
forest
which
gradually
became
thicker
again
and
appeared
also
to
have
more
inhabitants
for
if
the
eyes
of
the
sailor
did
not
deceive
him
he
thought
he
saw
bands
of
monkeys
springing
among
the
trees
sometimes
even
two
or
three
of
these
animals
stopped
at
a
little
distance
from
the
canoe
and
gazed
at
the
settlers
without
manifesting
any
terror
as
if
seeing
men
for
the
first
time
they
had
not
yet
learned
to
fear
them
it
would
have
been
easy
to
bring
down
one
of
these
quadramani
with
a
gunshot
and
pencroft
was
greatly
tempted
to
fire
but
harding
opposed
so
useless
a
massacre
this
was
prudent
for
the
monkeys
or
apes
rather
appearing
to
be
very
powerful
and
extremely
active
it
was
useless
to
provoke
an
unnecessary
aggression
and
the
creatures
might
ignorant
of
the
power
of
the
explorers
firearms
have
attacked
them
it
is
true
that
the
sailor
considered
the
monkeys
from
a
purely
alimentary
point
of
view
for
those
animals
which
are
herbivorous
make
very
excellent
game
but
since
they
had
an
abundant
supply
of
provisions
it
was
a
pity
to
waste
their
ammunition
towards
four
oclock
the
navigation
of
the
mercy
became
exceedingly
difficult
for
its
course
was
obstructed
by
aquatic
plants
and
rocks
the
banks
rose
higher
and
higher
and
already
they
were
approaching
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
the
source
could
not
be
far
off
since
it
was
fed
by
the
water
from
the
southern
slopes
of
the
mountain
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
said
the
sailor
we
shall
be
obliged
to
stop
captain
very
well
we
will
stop
pencroft
and
we
will
make
our
encampment
for
the
night
at
what
distance
are
we
from
granite
house
asked
herbert
about
seven
miles
replied
the
engineer
taking
into
calculation
however
the
detours
of
the
river
which
has
carried
us
to
the
northwest
shall
we
go
on
asked
the
reporter
yes
as
long
as
we
can
replied
cyrus
harding
tomorrow
at
break
of
day
we
will
leave
the
canoe
and
in
two
hours
i
hope
we
shall
cross
the
distance
which
separates
us
from
the
coast
and
then
we
shall
have
the
whole
day
in
which
to
explore
the
shore
go
ahead
replied
pencroft
but
soon
the
boat
grated
on
the
stony
bottom
of
the
river
which
was
now
not
more
than
twenty
feet
in
breadth
the
trees
met
like
a
bower
overhead
and
caused
a
halfdarkness
they
also
heard
the
noise
of
a
waterfall
which
showed
that
a
few
hundred
feet
up
the
river
there
was
a
natural
barrier
presently
after
a
sudden
turn
of
the
river
a
cascade
appeared
through
the
trees
the
canoe
again
touched
the
bottom
and
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
moored
to
a
trunk
near
the
right
bank
it
was
nearly
five
oclock
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
gleamed
through
the
thick
foliage
and
glanced
on
the
little
waterfall
making
the
spray
sparkle
with
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
beyond
that
the
mercy
was
lost
in
the
bushwood
where
it
was
fed
from
some
hidden
source
the
different
streams
which
flowed
into
it
increased
it
to
a
regular
river
further
down
but
here
it
was
simply
a
shallow
limpid
brook
it
was
agreed
to
camp
here
as
the
place
was
charming
the
colonists
disembarked
and
a
fire
was
soon
lighted
under
a
clump
of
trees
among
the
branches
of
which
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
could
if
it
was
necessary
take
refuge
for
the
night
supper
was
quickly
devoured
for
they
were
very
hungry
and
then
there
was
only
sleeping
to
think
of
but
as
roarings
of
rather
a
suspicious
nature
had
been
heard
during
the
evening
a
good
fire
was
made
up
for
the
night
so
as
to
protect
the
sleepers
with
its
crackling
flames
neb
and
pencroft
also
watched
by
turns
and
did
not
spare
fuel
they
thought
they
saw
the
dark
forms
of
some
wild
animals
prowling
round
the
camp
among
the
bushes
but
the
night
passed
without
incident
and
the
next
day
the
31st
of
october
at
five
oclock
in
the
morning
all
were
on
foot
ready
for
a
start
chapter
4
it
was
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
the
settlers
after
a
hasty
breakfast
set
out
to
reach
by
the
shortest
way
the
western
coast
of
the
island
and
how
long
would
it
take
to
do
this
cyrus
harding
had
said
two
hours
but
of
course
that
depended
on
the
nature
of
the
obstacles
they
might
meet
with
as
it
was
probable
that
they
would
have
to
cut
a
path
through
the
grass
shrubs
and
creepers
they
marched
axe
in
hand
and
with
guns
also
ready
wisely
taking
warning
from
the
cries
of
the
wild
beasts
heard
in
the
night
the
exact
position
of
the
encampment
could
be
determined
by
the
bearing
of
mount
franklin
and
as
the
volcano
arose
in
the
north
at
a
distance
of
less
than
three
miles
they
had
only
to
go
straight
towards
the
southwest
to
reach
the
western
coast
they
set
out
having
first
carefully
secured
the
canoe
pencroft
and
neb
carried
sufficient
provision
for
the
little
band
for
at
least
two
days
it
would
not
thus
be
necessary
to
hunt
the
engineer
advised
his
companions
to
refrain
from
firing
that
their
presence
might
not
be
betrayed
to
any
one
near
the
shore
the
first
hatchet
blows
were
given
among
the
brushwood
in
the
midst
of
some
mastictrees
a
little
above
the
cascade
and
his
compass
in
his
hand
cyrus
harding
led
the
way
the
forest
here
was
composed
for
the
most
part
of
trees
which
had
already
been
met
with
near
the
lake
and
on
prospect
heights
there
were
deodars
douglas
firs
casuarinas
gum
trees
eucalypti
hibiscus
cedars
and
other
trees
generally
of
a
moderate
size
for
their
number
prevented
their
growth
since
their
departure
the
settlers
had
descended
the
slopes
which
constituted
the
mountain
system
of
the
island
on
to
a
dry
soil
but
the
luxuriant
vegetation
of
which
indicated
it
to
be
watered
either
by
some
subterranean
marsh
or
by
some
stream
however
cyrus
harding
did
not
remember
having
seen
at
the
time
of
his
excursion
to
the
crater
any
other
watercourses
but
the
red
creek
and
the
mercy
during
the
first
part
of
their
excursion
they
saw
numerous
troops
of
monkeys
who
exhibited
great
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
men
whose
appearance
was
so
new
to
them
gideon
spilett
jokingly
asked
whether
these
active
and
merry
quadrupeds
did
not
consider
him
and
his
companions
as
degenerate
brothers
and
certainly
pedestrians
hindered
at
each
step
by
bushes
caught
by
creepers
barred
by
trunks
of
trees
did
not
shine
beside
those
supple
animals
who
bounding
from
branch
to
branch
were
hindered
by
nothing
on
their
course
the
monkeys
were
numerous
but
happily
they
did
not
manifest
any
hostile
disposition
several
pigs
agoutis
kangaroos
and
other
rodents
were
seen
also
two
or
three
koalas
at
which
pencroft
longed
to
have
a
shot
but
said
he
you
may
jump
and
play
just
now
we
shall
have
one
or
two
words
to
say
to
you
on
our
way
back
at
halfpast
nine
the
way
was
suddenly
found
to
be
barred
by
an
unknown
stream
from
thirty
to
forty
feet
broad
whose
rapid
current
dashed
foaming
over
the
numerous
rocks
which
interrupted
its
course
this
creek
was
deep
and
clear
but
it
was
absolutely
unnavigable
we
are
cut
off
cried
neb
no
replied
herbert
it
is
only
a
stream
and
we
can
easily
swim
over
what
would
be
the
use
of
that
returned
harding
this
creek
evidently
runs
to
the
sea
let
us
remain
on
this
side
and
follow
the
bank
and
i
shall
be
much
astonished
if
it
does
not
lead
us
very
quickly
to
the
coast
forward
one
minute
said
the
reporter
the
name
of
this
creek
my
friends
do
not
let
us
leave
our
geography
incomplete
all
right
said
pencroft
name
it
my
boy
said
the
engineer
addressing
the
lad
will
it
not
be
better
to
wait
until
we
have
explored
it
to
its
mouth
answered
herbert
very
well
replied
cyrus
harding
let
us
follow
it
as
fast
as
we
can
without
stopping
still
another
minute
said
pencroft
whats
the
matter
asked
the
reporter
though
hunting
is
forbidden
fishing
is
allowed
i
suppose
said
the
sailor
we
have
no
time
to
lose
replied
the
engineer
oh
five
minutes
replied
pencroft
i
only
ask
for
five
minutes
to
use
in
the
interest
of
our
breakfast
and
pencroft
lying
down
on
the
bank
plunged
his
arm
into
the
water
and
soon
pulled
up
several
dozen
of
fine
crayfish
from
among
the
stones
these
will
be
good
cried
neb
going
to
the
sailors
aid
as
i
said
there
is
everything
in
this
island
except
tobacco
muttered
pencroft
with
a
sigh
the
fishing
did
not
take
five
minutes
for
the
crayfish
were
swarming
in
the
creek
a
bag
was
filled
with
the
crustaceae
whose
shells
were
of
a
cobalt
blue
the
settlers
then
pushed
on
they
advanced
more
rapidly
and
easily
along
the
bank
of
the
river
than
in
the
forest
from
time
to
time
they
came
upon
the
traces
of
animals
of
a
large
size
who
had
come
to
quench
their
thirst
at
the
stream
but
none
were
actually
seen
and
it
was
evidently
not
in
this
part
of
the
forest
that
the
peccary
had
received
the
bullet
which
had
cost
pencroft
a
grinder
in
the
meanwhile
considering
the
rapid
current
harding
was
led
to
suppose
that
he
and
his
companions
were
much
farther
from
the
western
coast
than
they
had
at
first
supposed
in
fact
at
this
hour
the
rising
tide
would
have
turned
back
the
current
of
the
creek
if
its
mouth
had
only
been
a
few
miles
distant
now
this
effect
was
not
produced
and
the
water
pursued
its
natural
course
the
engineer
was
much
astonished
at
this
and
frequently
consulted
his
compass
to
assure
himself
that
some
turn
of
the
river
was
not
leading
them
again
into
the
far
west
however
the
creek
gradually
widened
and
its
waters
became
less
tumultuous
the
trees
on
the
right
bank
were
as
close
together
as
on
the
left
bank
and
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
anything
beyond
them
but
these
masses
of
wood
were
evidently
uninhabited
for
top
did
not
bark
and
the
intelligent
animal
would
not
have
failed
to
signal
the
presence
of
any
stranger
in
the
neighborhood
at
halfpast
ten
to
the
great
surprise
of
cyrus
harding
herbert
who
was
a
little
in
front
suddenly
stopped
and
exclaimed
the
sea
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
whole
western
shore
of
the
island
lay
extended
before
the
eyes
of
the
settlers
but
what
a
contrast
between
this
and
the
eastern
coast
upon
which
chance
had
first
thrown
them
no
granite
cliff
no
rocks
not
even
a
sandy
beach
the
forest
reached
the
shore
and
the
tall
trees
bending
over
the
water
were
beaten
by
the
waves
it
was
not
such
a
shore
as
is
usually
formed
by
nature
either
by
extending
a
vast
carpet
of
sand
or
by
grouping
masses
of
rock
but
a
beautiful
border
consisting
of
the
most
splendid
trees
the
bank
was
raised
a
little
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
on
this
luxuriant
soil
supported
by
a
granite
base
the
fine
forest
trees
seemed
to
be
as
firmly
planted
as
in
the
interior
of
the
island
the
colonists
were
then
on
the
shore
of
an
unimportant
little
harbor
which
would
scarcely
have
contained
even
two
or
three
fishingboats
it
served
as
a
neck
to
the
new
creek
of
which
the
curious
thing
was
that
its
waters
instead
of
joining
the
sea
by
a
gentle
slope
fell
from
a
height
of
more
than
forty
feet
which
explained
why
the
rising
tide
was
not
felt
up
the
stream
in
fact
the
tides
of
the
pacific
even
at
their
maximum
elevation
could
never
reach
the
level
of
the
river
and
doubtless
millions
of
years
would
pass
before
the
water
would
have
worn
away
the
granite
and
hollowed
a
practicable
mouth
it
was
settled
that
the
name
of
falls
river
should
be
given
to
this
stream
beyond
towards
the
north
the
forest
border
was
prolonged
for
a
space
of
nearly
two
miles
then
the
trees
became
scarcer
and
beyond
that
again
the
picturesque
heights
described
a
nearly
straight
line
which
ran
north
and
south
on
the
contrary
all
the
part
of
the
shore
between
falls
river
and
reptile
end
was
a
mass
of
wood
magnificent
trees
some
straight
others
bent
so
that
the
long
seaswell
bathed
their
roots
now
it
was
this
coast
that
is
all
the
serpentine
peninsula
that
was
to
be
explored
for
this
part
of
the
shore
offered
a
refuge
to
castaways
which
the
other
wild
and
barren
side
must
have
refused
the
weather
was
fine
and
clear
and
from
a
height
of
a
hillock
on
which
neb
and
pencroft
had
arranged
breakfast
a
wide
view
was
obtained
there
was
however
not
a
sail
in
sight
nothing
could
be
seen
along
the
shore
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
but
the
engineer
would
take
nothing
for
granted
until
he
had
explored
the
coast
to
the
very
extremity
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
breakfast
was
soon
despatched
and
at
halfpast
eleven
the
captain
gave
the
signal
for
departure
instead
of
proceeding
over
the
summit
of
a
cliff
or
along
a
sandy
beach
the
settlers
were
obliged
to
remain
under
cover
of
the
trees
so
that
they
might
continue
on
the
shore
the
distance
which
separated
falls
river
from
reptile
end
was
about
twelve
miles
it
would
have
taken
the
settlers
four
hours
to
do
this
on
a
clear
ground
and
without
hurrying
themselves
but
as
it
was
they
needed
double
the
time
for
what
with
trees
to
go
round
bushes
to
cut
down
and
creepers
to
chop
away
they
were
impeded
at
every
step
these
obstacles
greatly
lengthening
their
journey
there
was
however
nothing
to
show
that
a
shipwreck
had
taken
place
recently
it
is
true
that
as
gideon
spilett
observed
any
remains
of
it
might
have
drifted
out
to
sea
and
they
must
not
take
it
for
granted
that
because
they
could
find
no
traces
of
it
a
ship
had
not
been
castaway
on
the
coast
the
reporters
argument
was
just
and
besides
the
incident
of
the
bullet
proved
that
a
shot
must
have
been
fired
in
lincoln
island
within
three
months
it
was
already
five
oclock
and
there
were
still
two
miles
between
the
settlers
and
the
extremity
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
it
was
evident
that
after
having
reached
reptile
end
harding
and
his
companions
would
not
have
time
to
return
before
dark
to
their
encampment
near
the
source
of
the
mercy
it
would
therefore
be
necessary
to
pass
the
night
on
the
promontory
but
they
had
no
lack
of
provisions
which
was
lucky
for
there
were
no
animals
on
the
shore
though
birds
on
the
contrary
aboundjacamars
couroucous
tragopans
grouse
lories
parrots
cockatoos
pheasants
pigeons
and
a
hundred
others
there
was
not
a
tree
without
a
nest
and
not
a
nest
which
was
not
full
of
flapping
wings
towards
seven
oclock
the
weary
explorers
arrived
at
reptile
end
here
the
seaside
forest
ended
and
the
shore
resumed
the
customary
appearance
of
a
coast
with
rocks
reefs
and
sands
it
was
possible
that
something
might
be
found
here
but
darkness
came
on
and
the
further
exploration
had
to
be
put
off
to
the
next
day
pencroft
and
herbert
hastened
on
to
find
a
suitable
place
for
their
camp
among
the
last
trees
of
the
forest
of
the
far
west
the
boy
found
several
thick
clumps
of
bamboos
good
said
he
this
is
a
valuable
discovery
valuable
returned
pencroft
certainly
replied
herbert
i
may
say
pencroft
that
the
bark
of
the
bamboo
cut
into
flexible
laths
is
used
for
making
baskets
that
this
bark
mashed
into
a
paste
is
used
for
the
manufacture
of
chinese
paper
that
the
stalks
furnish
according
to
their
size
canes
and
pipes
and
are
used
for
conducting
water
that
large
bamboos
make
excellent
material
for
building
being
light
and
strong
and
being
never
attacked
by
insects
i
will
add
that
by
sawing
the
bamboo
in
two
at
the
joint
keeping
for
the
bottom
the
part
of
the
transverse
film
which
forms
the
joint
useful
cups
are
obtained
which
are
much
in
use
among
the
chinese
no
you
dont
care
for
that
but
but
what
but
i
can
tell
you
if
you
are
ignorant
of
it
that
in
india
these
bamboos
are
eaten
like
asparagus
asparagus
thirty
feet
high
exclaimed
the
sailor
and
are
they
good
excellent
replied
herbert
only
it
is
not
the
stems
of
thirty
feet
high
which
are
eaten
but
the
young
shoots
perfect
my
boy
perfect
replied
pencroft
i
will
also
add
that
the
pith
of
the
young
stalks
preserved
in
vinegar
makes
a
good
pickle
better
and
better
herbert
and
lastly
that
the
bamboos
exude
a
sweet
liquor
which
can
be
made
into
a
very
agreeable
drink
is
that
all
asked
the
sailor
that
is
all
and
they
dont
happen
to
do
for
smoking
no
my
poor
pencroft
herbert
and
the
sailor
had
not
to
look
long
for
a
place
in
which
to
pass
the
night
the
rocks
which
must
have
been
violently
beaten
by
the
sea
under
the
influence
of
the
winds
of
the
southwest
presented
many
cavities
in
which
shelter
could
be
found
against
the
night
air
but
just
as
they
were
about
to
enter
one
of
these
caves
a
loud
roaring
arrested
them
back
cried
pencroft
our
guns
are
only
loaded
with
small
shot
and
beasts
which
can
roar
as
loud
as
that
would
care
no
more
for
it
than
for
grains
of
salt
and
the
sailor
seizing
herbert
by
the
arm
dragged
him
behind
a
rock
just
as
a
magnificent
animal
showed
itself
at
the
entrance
of
the
cavern
it
was
a
jaguar
of
a
size
at
least
equal
to
its
asiatic
congeners
that
is
to
say
it
measured
five
feet
from
the
extremity
of
its
head
to
the
beginning
of
its
tail
the
yellow
color
of
its
hair
was
relieved
by
streaks
and
regular
oblong
spots
of
black
which
contrasted
with
the
white
of
its
chest
herbert
recognized
it
as
the
ferocious
rival
of
the
tiger
as
formidable
as
the
puma
which
is
the
rival
of
the
largest
wolf
the
jaguar
advanced
and
gazed
around
him
with
blazing
eyes
his
hair
bristling
as
if
this
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
scented
men
at
this
moment
the
reporter
appeared
round
a
rock
and
herbert
thinking
that
he
had
not
seen
the
jaguar
was
about
to
rush
towards
him
when
gideon
spilett
signed
to
him
to
remain
where
he
was
this
was
not
his
first
tiger
and
advancing
to
within
ten
feet
of
the
animal
he
remained
motionless
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
without
moving
a
muscle
the
jaguar
collected
itself
for
a
spring
but
at
that
moment
a
shot
struck
it
in
the
eyes
and
it
fell
dead
herbert
and
pencroft
rushed
towards
the
jaguar
neb
and
harding
also
ran
up
and
they
remained
for
some
instants
contemplating
the
animal
as
it
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
thinking
that
its
magnificent
skin
would
be
a
great
ornament
to
the
hall
at
granite
house
oh
mr
spilett
how
i
admire
and
envy
you
cried
herbert
in
a
fit
of
very
natural
enthusiasm
well
my
boy
replied
the
reporter
you
could
have
done
the
same
i
with
such
coolness
imagine
to
yourself
herbert
that
the
jaguar
is
only
a
hare
and
you
would
fire
as
quietly
as
possible
that
is
rejoined
pencroft
that
it
is
not
more
dangerous
than
a
hare
and
now
said
gideon
spilett
since
the
jaguar
has
left
its
abode
i
do
not
see
my
friends
why
we
should
not
take
possession
of
it
for
the
night
but
others
may
come
said
pencroft
it
will
be
enough
to
light
a
fire
at
the
entrance
of
the
cavern
said
the
reporter
and
no
wild
beasts
will
dare
to
cross
the
threshold
into
the
jaguars
house
then
replied
the
sailor
dragging
after
him
the
body
of
the
animal
while
neb
skinned
the
jaguar
his
companions
collected
an
abundant
supply
of
dry
wood
from
the
forest
which
they
heaped
up
at
the
cave
cyrus
harding
seeing
the
clump
of
bamboos
cut
a
quantity
which
he
mingled
with
the
other
fuel
this
done
they
entered
the
grotto
of
which
the
floor
was
strewn
with
bones
the
guns
were
carefully
loaded
in
case
of
a
sudden
attack
they
had
supper
and
then
just
before
they
lay
down
to
rest
the
heap
of
wood
piled
at
the
entrance
was
set
fire
to
immediately
a
regular
explosion
or
rather
a
series
of
reports
broke
the
silence
the
noise
was
caused
by
the
bamboos
which
as
the
flames
reached
them
exploded
like
fireworks
the
noise
was
enough
to
terrify
even
the
boldest
of
wild
beasts
it
was
not
the
engineer
who
had
invented
this
way
of
causing
loud
explosions
for
according

tartars
have
employed
it

chapter

cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
slept
like
innocent
marmots
in
the
cave
which
the
jaguar
had
so
politely
left
at
their
disposal
at
sunrise
all
were
on
the
shore
at
the
extremity
of
the
promontory
and
their
gaze
was
directed
towards
the
horizon
of
which
twothirds
of
the
circumference
were
visible
for
the
last
time
the
engineer
could
ascertain
that
not
a
sail
nor
the
wreck
of
a
ship
was
on
the
sea
and
even
with
the
telescope
nothing
suspicious
could
be
discovered
there
was
nothing
either
on
the
shore
at
least
in
the
straight
line
of
three
miles
which
formed
the
south
side
of
the
promontory
for
beyond
that
rising
ground
had
the
rest
of
the
coast
and
even
from
the
extremity
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
claw
cape
could
not
be
seen
the
southern
coast
of
the
island
still
remained
to
be
explored
now
should
they
undertake
it
immediately
and
devote
this
day
to
it
this
was
not
included
in
their
first
plan
in
fact
when
the
boat
was
abandoned
at
the
sources
of
the
mercy
it
had
been
agreed
that
after
having
surveyed
the
west
coast
they
should
go
back
to
it
and
return
to
granite
house
by
the
mercy
harding
then
thought
that
the
western
coast
would
have
offered
refuge
either
to
a
ship
in
distress
or
to
a
vessel
in
her
regular
course
but
now
as
he
saw
that
this
coast
presented
no
good
anchorage
he
wished
to
seek
on
the
south
what
they
had
not
been
able
to
find
on
the
west
gideon
spilett
proposed
to
continue
the
exploration
that
the
question
of
the
supposed
wreck
might
be
completely
settled
and
he
asked
at
what
distance
claw
cape
might
be
from
the
extremity
of
the
peninsula
about
thirty
miles
replied
the
engineer
if
we
take
into
consideration
the
curvings
of
the
coast
thirty
miles
returned
spilett
that
would
be
a
long
days
march
nevertheless
i
think
that
we
should
return
to
granite
house
by
the
south
coast
but
observed
herbert
from
claw
cape
to
granite
house
there
must
be
at
least
another
ten
miles
make
it
forty
miles
in
all
replied
the
engineer
and
do
not
hesitate
to
do
it
at
least
we
should
survey
the
unknown
shore
and
then
we
shall
not
have
to
begin
the
exploration
again
very
good
said
pencroft
but
the
boat
the
boat
has
remained
by
itself
for
one
day
at
the
sources
of
the
mercy
replied
gideon
spilett
it
may
just
as
well
stay
there
two
days
as
yet
we
have
had
no
reason
to
think
that
the
island
is
infested
by
thieves
yet
said
the
sailor
when
i
remember
the
history
of
the
turtle
i
am
far
from
confident
of
that
the
turtle
the
turtle
replied
the
reporter
dont
you
know
that
the
sea
turned
it
over
who
knows
murmured
the
engineer
but
said
neb
neb
had
evidently
something
to
say
for
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
yet
said
nothing
what
do
you
want
to
say
neb
asked
the
engineer
if
we
return
by
the
shore
to
claw
cape
replied
neb
after
having
doubled
the
cape
we
shall
be
stopped
by
the
mercy
of
course
replied
herbert
and
we
shall
have
neither
bridge
nor
boat
by
which
to
cross
but
captain
added
pencroft
with
a
few
floating
trunks
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
crossing
the
river
never
mind
said
spilett
it
will
be
useful
to
construct
a
bridge
if
we
wish
to
have
an
easy
access
to
the
far
west
a
bridge
cried
pencroft
well
is
not
the
captain
the
best
engineer
in
his
profession
he
will
make
us
a
bridge
when
we
want
one
as
to
transporting
you
this
evening
to
the
other
side
of
the
mercy
and
that
without
wetting
one
thread
of
your
clothes
i
will
take
care
of
that
we
have
provisions
for
another
day
and
besides
we
can
get
plenty
of
game
forward
the
reporters
proposal
so
strongly
seconded
by
the
sailor
received
general
approbation
for
each
wished
to
have
their
doubts
set
at
rest
and
by
returning
by
claw
cape
the
exploration
would
be
ended
but
there
was
not
an
hour
to
lose
for
forty
miles
was
a
long
march
and
they
could
not
hope
to
reach
granite
house
before
night
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
the
little
band
set
out
as
a
precaution
the
guns
were
loaded
with
ball
and
top
who
led
the
van
received
orders
to
beat
about
the
edge
of
the
forest
from
the
extremity
of
the
promontory
which
formed
the
tail
of
the
peninsula
the
coast
was
rounded
for
a
distance
of
five
miles
which
was
rapidly
passed
over
without
even
the
most
minute
investigations
bringing
to
light
the
least
trace
of
any
old
or
recent
landings
no
debris
no
mark
of
an
encampment
no
cinders
of
a
fire
nor
even
a
footprint
from
the
point
of
the
peninsula
on
which
the
settlers
now
were
their
gaze
could
extend
along
the
southwest
twentyfive
miles
off
the
coast
terminated
in
the
claw
cape
which
loomed
dimly
through
the
morning
mists
and
which
by
the
phenomenon
of
the
mirage
appeared
as
if
suspended
between
land
and
water
between
the
place
occupied
by
the
colonists
and
the
other
side
of
the
immense
bay
the
shore
was
composed
first
of
a
tract
of
low
land
bordered
in
the
background
by
trees
then
the
shore
became
more
irregular
projecting
sharp
points
into
the
sea
and
finally
ended
in
the
black
rocks
which
accumulated
in
picturesque
disorder
formed
claw
cape
such
was
the
development
of
this
part
of
the
island
which
the
settlers
took
in
at
a
glance
while
stopping
for
an
instant
if
a
vessel
ran
in
here
said
pencroft
she
would
certainly
be
lost
sandbanks
and
reefs
everywhere
bad
quarters
but
at
least
something
would
be
left
of
the
ship
observed
the
reporter
there
might
be
pieces
of
wood
on
the
rocks
but
nothing
on
the
sands
replied
the
sailor
why
because
the
sands
are
still
more
dangerous
than
the
rocks
for
they
swallow
up
everything
that
is
thrown
on
them
in
a
few
days
the
hull
of
a
ship
of
several
hundred
tons
would
disappear
entirely
in
there
so
pencroft
asked
the
engineer
if
a
ship
has
been
wrecked
on
these
banks
is
it
not
astonishing
that
there
is
now
no
trace
of
her
remaining
no
captain
with
the
aid
of
time
and
tempest
however
it
would
be
surprising
even
in
this
case
that
some
of
the
masts
or
spars
should
not
have
been
thrown
on
the
beach
out
of
reach
of
the
waves
let
us
go
on
with
our
search
then
returned
cyrus
harding
at
one
oclock
the
colonists
arrived
at
the
other
side
of
washington
bay
they
having
now
gone
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
they
then
halted
for
breakfast
here
began
the
irregular
coast
covered
with
lines
of
rocks
and
sandbanks
the
long
seaswell
could
be
seen
breaking
over
the
rocks
in
the
bay
forming
a
foamy
fringe
from
this
point
to
claw
cape
the
beach
was
very
narrow
between
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
the
reefs
walking
was
now
more
difficult
on
account
of
the
numerous
rocks
which
encumbered
the
beach
the
granite
cliff
also
gradually
increased
in
height
and
only
the
green
tops
of
the
trees
which
crowned
it
could
be
seen
after
half
an
hours
rest
the
settlers
resumed
their
journey
and
not
a
spot
among
the
rocks
was
left
unexamined
pencroft
and
neb
even
rushed
into
the
surf
whenever
any
object
attracted
their
attention
but
they
found
nothing
some
curious
formations
of
the
rocks
having
deceived
them
they
ascertained
however
that
eatable
shellfish
abounded
there
but
these
could
not
be
of
any
great
advantage
to
them
until
some
easy
means
of
communication
had
been
established
between
the
two
banks
of
the
mercy
and
until
the
means
of
transport
had
been
perfected
nothing
therefore
which
threw
any
light
on
the
supposed
wreck
could
be
found
on
this
shore
yet
an
object
of
any
importance
such
as
the
hull
of
a
ship
would
have
been
seen
directly
or
any
of
her
masts
and
spars
would
have
been
washed
on
shore
just
as
the
chest
had
been
which
was
found
twenty
miles
from
here
but
there
was
nothing
towards
three
oclock
harding
and
his
companions
arrived
at
a
snug
little
creek
it
formed
quite
a
natural
harbor
invisible
from
the
sea
and
was
entered
by
a
narrow
channel
at
the
back
of
this
creek
some
violent
convulsion
had
torn
up
the
rocky
border
and
a
cutting
by
a
gentle
slope
gave
access
to
an
upper
plateau
which
might
be
situated
at
least
ten
miles
from
claw
cape
and
consequently
four
miles
in
a
straight
line
from
prospect
heights
gideon
spilett
proposed
to
his
companions
that
they
should
make
a
halt
here
they
agreed
readily
for
their
walk
had
sharpened
their
appetites
and
although
it
was
not
their
usual
dinnerhour
no
one
refused
to
strengthen
himself
with
a
piece
of
venison
this
luncheon
would
sustain
them
until
their
supper
which
they
intended
to
take
at
granite
house
in
a
few
minutes
the
settlers
seated
under
a
clump
of
fine
seapines
were
devouring
the
provisions
which
neb
produced
from
his
bag
this
spot
was
raised
from
fifty
to
sixty
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
the
view
was
very
extensive
but
beyond
the
cape
it
ended
in
union
bay
neither
the
islet
nor
prospect
heights
was
visible
and
could
not
be
from
thence
for
the
rising
ground
and
the
curtain
of
trees
closed
the
northern
horizon
it
is
useless
to
add
that
notwithstanding
the
wide
extent
of
sea
which
the
explorers
could
survey
and
though
the
engineer
swept
the
horizon
with
his
glass
no
vessel
could
be
found
the
shore
was
of
course
examined
with
the
same
care
from
the
edge
of
the
water
to
the
cliff
and
nothing
could
be
discovered
even
with
the
aid
of
the
instrument
well
said
gideon
spilett
it
seems
we
must
make
up
our
minds
to
console
ourselves
with
thinking
that
no
one
will
come
to
dispute
with
us
the
possession
of
lincoln
island
but
the
bullet
cried
herbert
that
was
not
imaginary
i
suppose
hang
it
no
exclaimed
pencroft
thinking
of
his
absent
tooth
then
what
conclusion
may
be
drawn
asked
the
reporter
this
replied
the
engineer
that
three
months
or
more
ago
a
vessel
either
voluntarily
or
not
came
here
what
then
you
admit
cyrus
that
she
was
swallowed
up
without
leaving
any
trace
cried
the
reporter
no
my
dear
spilett
but
you
see
that
if
it
is
certain
that
a
human
being
set
foot
on
the
island
it
appears
no
less
certain
that
he
has
now
left
it
then
if
i
understand
you
right
captain
said
herbert
the
vessel
has
left
again
evidently
and
we
have
lost
an
opportunity
to
get
back
to
our
country
said
neb
i
fear
so
very
well
since
the
opportunity
is
lost
let
us
go
on
it
cant
be
helped
said
pencroft
who
felt
homesickness
for
granite
house
but
just
as
they
were
rising
top
was
heard
loudly
barking
and
the
dog
issued
from
the
wood
holding
in
his
mouth
a
rag
soiled
with
mud
neb
seized
it
it
was
a
piece
of
strong
cloth
top
still
barked
and
by
his
going
and
coming
seemed
to
invite
his
master
to
follow
him
into
the
forest
now
theres
something
to
explain
the
bullet
exclaimed
pencroft
a
castaway
replied
herbert
wounded
perhaps
said
neb
or
dead
added
the
reporter
all
ran
after
the
dog
among
the
tall
pines
on
the
border
of
the
forest
harding
and
his
companions
made
ready
their
firearms
in
case
of
an
emergency
they
advanced
some
way
into
the
wood
but
to
their
great
disappointment
they
as
yet
saw
no
signs
of
any
human
being
having
passed
that
way
shrubs
and
creepers
were
uninjured
and
they
had
even
to
cut
them
away
with
the
axe
as
they
had
done
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
forest
it
was
difficult
to
fancy
that
any
human
creature
had
ever
passed
there
but
yet
top
went
backward
and
forward
not
like
a
dog
who
searches
at
random
but
like
a
dog
being
endowed
with
a
mind
who
is
following
up
an
idea
in
about
seven
or
eight
minutes
top
stopped
in
a
glade
surrounded
with
tall
trees
the
settlers
gazed
around
them
but
saw
nothing
neither
under
the
bushes
nor
among
the
trees
what
is
the
matter
top
said
cyrus
harding
top
barked
louder
bounding
about
at
the
foot
of
a
gigantic
pine
all
at
once
pencroft
shoutedho
splendid
capital
what
is
it
asked
spilett
we
have
been
looking
for
a
wreck
at
sea
or
on
land
well
well
and
here
weve
found
one
in
the
air
and
the
sailor
pointed
to
a
great
white
rag
caught
in
the
top
of
the
pine
a
fallen
scrap
of
which
the
dog
had
brought
to
them
but
that
is
not
a
wreck
cried
gideon
spilett
i
beg
your
pardon
returned
pencroft
why
is
it
it
is
all
that
remains
of
our
airy
boat
of
our
balloon
which
has
been
caught
up
aloft
there
at
the
top
of
that
tree
pencroft
was
not
mistaken
and
he
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
in
a
tremendous
hurrah
adding
there
is
good
cloth
there
is
what
will
furnish
us
with
linen
for
years
there
is
what
will
make
us
handkerchiefs
and
shirts
ha
ha
mr
spilett
what
do
you
say
to
an
island
where
shirts
grow
on
the
trees
it
was
certainly
a
lucky
circumstance
for
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
that
the
balloon
after
having
made
its
last
bound
into
the
air
had
fallen
on
the
island
and
thus
given
them
the
opportunity
of
finding
it
again
whether
they
kept
the
case
under
its
present
form
or
whether
they
wished
to
attempt
another
escape
by
it
or
whether
they
usefully
employed
the
several
hundred
yards
of
cotton
which
was
of
fine
quality
pencrofts
joy
was
therefore
shared
by
all
but
it
was
necessary
to
bring
down
the
remains
of
the
balloon
from
the
tree
to
place
it
in
security
and
this
was
no
slight
task
neb
herbert
and
the
sailor
climbing
to
the
summit
of
the
tree
used
all
their
skill
to
disengage
the
now
reduced
balloon
the
operation
lasted
two
hours
and
then
not
only
the
case
with
its
valve
its
springs
its
brasswork
lay
on
the
ground
but
the
net
that
is
to
say
a
considerable
quantity
of
ropes
and
cordage
and
the
circle
and
the
anchor
the
case
except
for
the
fracture
was
in
good
condition
only
the
lower
portion
being
torn
it
was
a
fortune
which
had
fallen
from
the
sky
all
the
same
captain
said
the
sailor
if
we
ever
decide
to
leave
the
island
it
wont
be
in
a
balloon
will
it
these
airboats
wont
go
where
we
want
them
to
go
and
we
have
had
some
experience
in
that
way
look
here
we
will
build
a
craft
of
some
twenty
tons
and
then
we
can
make
a
mainsail
a
foresail
and
a
jib
out
of
that
cloth
as
to
the
rest
of
it
that
will
help
to
dress
us
we
shall
see
pencroft
replied
cyrus
harding
we
shall
see
in
the
meantime
we
must
put
it
in
a
safe
place
said
neb
they
certainly
could
not
think
of
carrying
this
load
of
cloth
ropes
and
cordage
to
granite
house
for
the
weight
of
it
was
very
considerable
and
while
waiting
for
a
suitable
vehicle
in
which
to
convey
it
it
was
of
importance
that
this
treasure
should
not
be
left
longer
exposed
to
the
mercies
of
the
first
storm
the
settlers
uniting
their
efforts
managed
to
drag
it
as
far
as
the
shore
where
they
discovered
a
large
rocky
cavity
which
owing
to
its
position
could
not
be
visited
either
by
the
wind
or
rain
we
needed
a
locker
and
now
we
have
one
said
pencroft
but
as
we
cannot
lock
it
up
it
will
be
prudent
to
hide
the
opening
i
dont
mean
from
twolegged
thieves
but
from
those
with
four
paws
at
six
oclock
all
was
stowed
away
and
after
having
given
the
creek
the
very
suitable
name
of
port
balloon
the
settlers
pursued
their
way
along
claw
cape
pencroft
and
the
engineer
talked
of
the
different
projects
which
it
was
agreed
to
put
into
execution
with
the
briefest
possible
delay
it
was
necessary
first
of
all
to
throw
a
bridge
over
the
mercy
so
as
to
establish
an
easy
communication
with
the
south
of
the
island
then
the
cart
must
be
taken
to
bring
back
the
balloon
for
the
canoe
alone
could
not
carry
it
then
they
would
build
a
decked
boat
and
pencroft
would
rig
it
as
a
cutter
and
they
would
be
able
to
undertake
voyages
of
circumnavigation
round
the
island
etc
in
the
meanwhile
night
came
on
and
it
was
already
dark
when
the
settlers
reached
flotsam
point
where
they
had
found
the
precious
chest
the
distance
between
flotsam
point
and
granite
house
was
another
four
miles
and
it
was
midnight
when
after
having
followed
the
shore
to
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
the
settlers
arrived
at
the
first
angle
formed
by
the
mercy
there
the
river
was
eighty
feet
in
breadth
which
was
awkward
to
cross
but
as
pencroft
had
taken
upon
himself
to
conquer
this
difficulty
he
was
compelled
to
do
it
the
settlers
certainly
had
reason
to
be
pretty
tired
the
journey
had
been
long
and
the
task
of
getting
down
the
balloon
had
not
rested
either
their
arms
or
legs
they
were
anxious
to
reach
granite
house
to
eat
and
sleep
and
if
the
bridge
had
been
constructed
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
would
have
been
at
home
the
night
was
very
dark
pencroft
prepared
to
keep
his
promise
by
constructing
a
sort
of
raft
on
which
to
make
the
passage
of
the
mercy
he
and
neb
armed
with
axes
chose
two
trees
near
the
water
and
began
to
attack
them
at
the
base
cyrus
harding
and
spilett
seated
on
the
bank
waited
till
their
companions
were
ready
for
their
help
while
herbert
roamed
about
though
without
going
to
any
distance
all
at
once
the
lad
who
had
strolled
by
the
river
came
running
back
and
pointing
up
the
mercy
exclaimed
what
is
floating
there
pencroft
stopped
working
and
seeing
an
indistinct
object
moving
through
the
gloom
a
canoe
cried
he
all
approached
and
saw
to
their
extreme
surprise
a
boat
floating
down
the
current
boat
ahoy
shouted
the
sailor
without
thinking
that
perhaps
it
would
be
best
to
keep
silence
no
reply
the
boat
still
drifted
onward
and
it
was
not
more
than
twelve
feet
off
when
the
sailor
exclaimed
but
it
is
our
own
boat
she
has
broken
her
moorings
and
floated
down
the
current
i
must
say
she
has
arrived
very
opportunely
our
boat
murmured
the
engineer
pencroft
was
right
it
was
indeed
the
canoe
of
which
the
rope
had
undoubtedly
broken
and
which
had
come
alone
from
the
sources
of
the
mercy
it
was
very
important
to
seize
it
before
the
rapid
current
should
have
swept
it
away
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
river
but
neb
and
pencroft
cleverly
managed
this
by
means
of
a
long
pole
the
canoe
touched
the
shore
the
engineer
leaped
in
first
and
found
on
examining
the
rope
that
it
had
been
really
worn
through
by
rubbing
against
the
rocks
well
said
the
reporter
to
him
in
a
low
voice
this
is
a
strange
thing
strange
indeed
returned
cyrus
harding
strange
or
not
it
was
very
fortunate
herbert
the
reporter
neb
and
pencroft
embarked
in
turn
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
rope
having
been
worn
through
but
the
astonishing
part
of
the
affair
was
that
the
boat
should
arrive
just
at
the
moment
when
the
settlers
were
there
to
seize
it
on
its
way
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
or
later
it
would
have
been
lost
in
the
sea
if
they
had
been
living
in
the
time
of
genii
this
incident
would
have
given
them
the
right
to
think
that
the
island
was
haunted
by
some
supernatural
being
who
used
his
power
in
the
service
of
the
castaways
a
few
strokes
of
the
oar
brought
the
settlers
to
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
the
canoe
was
hauled
up
on
the
beach
near
the
chimneys
and
all
proceeded
towards
the
ladder
of
granite
house
but
at
that
moment
top
barked
angrily
and
neb
who
was
looking
for
the
first
steps
uttered
a
cry
there
was
no
longer
a
ladder

cyrus

stood
still
without
saying
a
word
his
companions
searched
in
the
darkness
on
the
wall
in
case
the
wind
should
have
moved
the
ladder
and
on
the
ground
thinking
that
it
might
have
fallen
down
but
the
ladder
had
quite
disappeared
as
to
ascertaining
if
a
squall
had
blown
it
on
the
landingplace
half
way
up
that
was
impossible
in
the
dark
if
it

is
any
one
up
there
replied
pencroft
who
began
to
lose
patience
i
will
give
them
a
hail
and
they
must
answer
and
in
a
stentorian
voice
the
sailor
gave
a
prolonged
halloo
which
was
echoed
again
and
again
from
the
cliff
and
rocks
the
settlers
listened
and
they
thought
they
heard
a
sort
of
chuckling
laugh
of
which
they
could
not
guess
the
origin
but
no
voice
replied
to
pencroft
who
in
vain
repeated
his
vigorous
shouts
there
was
something
indeed
in
this
to
astonish
the
most
apathetic
of
men
and
the
settlers
were
not
men
of
that
description
in
their
situation
every
incident
had
its
importance
and
certainly
during
the
seven
months
which
they
had
spent
on
the
island
they
had
not
before
met
with
anything
of
so
surprising
a
character
be
that
as
it
may
forgetting
their
fatigue
in
the
singularity
of
the
event
they
remained
below
granite
house
not
knowing
what
to
think
not
knowing
what
to
do
questioning
each
other
without
any
hope
of
a
satisfactory
reply
every
one
starting
some
supposition
each
more
unlikely
than
the
last
neb
bewailed
himself
much
disappointed
at
not
being
able
to
get
into
his
kitchen
for
the
provisions
which
they
had
had
on
their
expedition
were
exhausted
and
they
had
no
means
of
renewing
them
my
friends
at
last
said
cyrus
harding
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
done
at
present
wait
for
day
and
then
act
according
to
circumstances
but
let
us
go
to
the
chimneys
there
we
shall
be
under
shelter
and
if
we
cannot
eat
we
can
at
least
sleep
but
who
is
it
that
has
played
us
this
cool
trick
again
asked
pencroft
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
retire
from
the
spot
whoever
it
was
the
only
thing
practicable
was
to
do
as
the
engineer
proposed
to
go
to
the
chimneys
and
there
wait
for
day
in
the
meanwhile
top
was
ordered
to
mount
guard
below
the
windows
of
granite
house
and
when
top
received
an
order
he
obeyed
it
without
any
questioning
the
brave
dog
therefore
remained
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
while
his
master
with
his
companions
sought
a
refuge
among
the
rocks
to
say
that
the
settlers
notwithstanding
their
fatigue
slept
well
on
the
sandy
floor
of
the
chimneys
would
not
be
true
it
was
not
only
that
they
were
extremely
anxious
to
find
out
the
cause
of
what
had
happened
whether
it
was
the
result
of
an
accident
which
would
be
discovered
at
the
return
of
day
or
whether
on
the
contrary
it
was
the
work
of
a
human
being
but
they
also
had
very
uncomfortable
beds
that
could
not
be
helped
however
for
in
some
way
or
other
at
that
moment
their
dwelling
was
occupied
and
they
could
not
possibly
enter
it
now
granite
house
was
more
than
their
dwelling
it
was
their
warehouse
there
were
all
the
stores
belonging
to
the
colony
weapons
instruments
tools
ammunition
provisions
etc
to
think
that
all
that
might
be
pillaged
and
that
the
settlers
would
have
all
their
work
to
do
over
again
fresh
weapons
and
tools
to
make
was
a
serious
matter
their
uneasiness
led
one
or
other
of
them
also
to
go
out
every
few
minutes
to
see
if
top
was
keeping
good
watch
cyrus
harding
alone
waited
with
his
habitual
patience
although
his
strong
mind
was
exasperated
at
being
confronted
with
such
an
inexplicable
fact
and
he
was
provoked
at
himself
for
allowing
a
feeling
to
which
he
could
not
give
a
name
to
gain
an
influence
over
him
gideon
spilett
shared
his
feelings
in
this
respect
and
the
two
conversed
together
in
whispers
of
the
inexplicable
circumstance
which
baffled
even
their
intelligence
and
experience
it
is
a
joke
said
pencroft
it
is
a
trick
some
one
has
played
us
well
i
dont
like
such
jokes
and
the
joker
had
better
look
out
for
himself
if
he
falls
into
my
hands
i
can
tell
him
as
soon
as
the
first
gleam
of
light
appeared
in
the
east
the
colonists
suitably
armed
repaired
to
the
beach
under
granite
house
the
rising
sun
now
shone
on
the
cliff
and
they
could
see
the
windows
the
shutters
of
which
were
closed
through
the
curtains
of
foliage
all
here
was
in
order
but
a
cry
escaped
the
colonists
when
they
saw
that
the
door
which
they
had
closed
on
their
departure
was
now
wide
open
some
one
had
entered
granite
housethere
could
be
no
more
doubt
about
that
the
upper
ladder
which
generally
hung
from
the
door
to
the
landing
was
in
its
place
but
the
lower
ladder
was
drawn
up
and
raised
to
the
threshold
it
was
evident
that
the
intruders
had
wished
to
guard
themselves
against
a
surprise
pencroft
hailed
again
no
reply
the
beggars
exclaimed
the
sailor
there
they
are
sleeping
quietly
as
if
they
were
in
their
own
house
hallo
there
you
pirates
brigands
robbers
sons
of
john
bull
when
pencroft
being
a
yankee
treated
any
one
to
the
epithet
of
son
of
john
bull
he
considered
he
had
reached
the
last
limits
of
insult
the
sun
had
now
completely
risen
and
the
whole
facade
of
granite
house
became
illuminated
by
its
rays
but
in
the
interior
as
well
as
on
the
exterior
all
was
quiet
and
calm
the
settlers
asked
if
granite
house
was
inhabited
or
not
and
yet
the
position
of
the
ladder
was
sufficient
to
show
that
it
was
it
was
also
certain
that
the
inhabitants
whoever
they
might
be
had
not
been
able
to
escape
but
how
were
they
to
be
got
at
herbert
then
thought
of
fastening
a
cord
to
an
arrow
and
shooting
the
arrow
so
that
it
should
pass
between
the
first
rounds
of
the
ladder
which
hung
from
the
threshold
by
means
of
the
cord
they
would
then
be
able
to
draw
down
the
ladder
to
the
ground
and
so
reestablish
the
communication
between
the
beach
and
granite
house
there
was
evidently
nothing
else
to
be
done
and
with
a
little
skill
this
method
might
succeed
very
fortunately
bows
and
arrows
had
been
left
at
the
chimneys
where
they
also
found
a
quantity
of
light
hibiscus
cord
pencroft
fastened
this
to
a
wellfeathered
arrow
then
herbert
fixing
it
to
his
bow
took
a
careful
aim
for
the
lower
part
of
the
ladder
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
pencroft
and
neb
drew
back
so
as
to
see
if
anything
appeared
at
the
windows
the
reporter
lifted
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
covered
the
door
the
bow
was
bent
the
arrow
flew
taking
the
cord
with
it
and
passed
between
the
two
last
rounds
the
operation
had
succeeded
herbert
immediately
seized
the
end
of
the
cord
but
at
that
moment
when
he
gave
it
a
pull
to
bring
down
the
ladder
an
arm
thrust
suddenly
out
between
the
wall
and
the
door
grasped
it
and
dragged
it
inside
granite
house
the
rascals
shouted
the
sailor
if
a
ball
can
do
anything
for
you
you
shall
not
have
long
to
wait
for
it
but
who
was
it
asked
neb
who
was
it
didnt
you
see
no
it
was
a
monkey
a
sapajou
an
orangoutang
a
baboon
a
gorilla
a
sagoin
our
dwelling
has
been
invaded
by
monkeys
who
climbed
up
the
ladder
during
our
absence
and
at
this
moment
as
if
to
bear
witness
to
the
truth
of
the
sailors
words
two
or
three
quadrumana
showed
themselves
at
the
windows
from
which
they
had
pushed
back
the
shutters
and
saluted
the
real
proprietors
of
the
place
with
a
thousand
hideous
grimaces
i
knew
that
it
was
only
a
joke
cried
pencroft
but
one
of
the
jokers
shall
pay
the
penalty
for
the
rest
so
saying
the
sailor
raising
his
piece
took
a
rapid
aim
at
one
of
the
monkeys
and
fired
all
disappeared
except
one
who
fell
mortally
wounded
on
the
beach
this
monkey
which
was
of
a
large
size
evidently
belonged
to
the
first
order
of
the
quadrumana
whether
this
was
a
chimpanzee
an
orangoutang
or
a
gorilla
he
took
rank
among
the
anthropoid
apes
who
are
so
called
from
their
resemblance
to
the
human
race
however
herbert
declared
it
to
be
an
orangoutang
what
a
magnificent
beast
cried
neb
magnificent
if
you
like
replied
pencroft
but
still
i
do
not
see
how
we
are
to
get
into
our
house
herbert
is
a
good
marksman
said
the
reporter
and
his
bow
is
here
he
can
try
again
why
these
apes
are
so
cunning
returned
pencroft
they
wont
show
themselves
again
at
the
windows
and
so
we
cant
kill
them
and
when
i
think
of
the
mischief
they
may
do
in
the
rooms
and
storehouse
have
patience
replied
harding
these
creatures
cannot
keep
us
long
at
bay
i
shall
not
be
sure
of
that
till
i
see
them
down
here
replied
the
sailor
and
now
captain
do
you
know
how
many
dozens
of
these
fellows
are
up
there
it
was
difficult
to
reply
to
pencroft
and
as
for
the
young
boy
making
another
attempt
that
was
not
easy
for
the
lower
part
of
the
ladder
had
been
drawn
again
into
the
door
and
when
another
pull
was
given
the
line
broke
and
the
ladder
remained
firm
the
case
was
really
perplexing
pencroft
stormed
there
was
a
comic
side
to
the
situation
but
he
did
not
think
it
funny
at
all
it
was
certain
that
the
settlers
would
end
by
reinstating
themselves
in
their
domicile
and
driving
out
the
intruders
but
when
and
how
this
is
what
they
were
not
able
to
say
two
hours
passed
during
which
the
apes
took
care
not
to
show
themselves
but
they
were
still
there
and
three
or
four
times
a
nose
or
a
paw
was
poked
out
at
the
door
or
windows
and
was
immediately
saluted
by
a
gunshot
let
us
hide
ourselves
at
last
said
the
engineer
perhaps
the
apes
will
think
we
have
gone
quite
away
and
will
show
themselves
again
let
spilett
and
herbert
conceal
themselves
behind
those
rocks
and
fire
on
all
that
may
appear
the
engineers
orders
were
obeyed
and
while
the
reporter
and
the
lad
the
best
marksmen
in
the
colony
posted
themselves
in
a
good
position
but
out
of
the
monkeys
sight
neb
pencroft
and
cyrus
climbed
the
plateau
and
entered
the
forest
in
order
to
kill
some
game
for
it
was
now
time
for
breakfast
and
they
had
no
provisions
remaining
in
half
an
hour
the
hunters
returned
with
a
few
rock
pigeons
which
they
roasted
as
well
as
they
could
not
an
ape
had
appeared
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
went
to
take
their
share
of
the
breakfast
leaving
top
to
watch
under
the
windows
they
then
having
eaten
returned
to
their
post
two
hours
later
their
situation
was
in
no
degree
improved
the
quadrumana
gave
no
sign
of
existence
and
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
they
had
disappeared
but
what
seemed
more
probable
was
that
terrified
by
the
death
of
one
of
their
companions
and
frightened
by
the
noise
of
the
firearms
they
had
retreated
to
the
back
part
of
the
house
or
probably
even
into
the
storeroom
and
when
they
thought
of
the
valuables
which
this
storeroom
contained
the
patience
so
much
recommended
by
the
engineer
fast
changed
into
great
irritation
and
there
certainly
was
room
for
it
decidedly
it
is
too
bad
said
the
reporter
and
the
worst
of
it
is
there
is
no
way
of
putting
an
end
to
it
but
we
must
drive
these
vagabonds
out
somehow
cried
the
sailor
we
could
soon
get
the
better
of
them
even
if
there
are
twenty
of
the
rascals
but
for
that
we
must
meet
them
hand
to
hand
come
now
is
there
no
way
of
getting
at
them
let
us
try
to
enter
granite
house
by
the
old
opening
at
the
lake
replied
the
engineer
oh
shouted
the
sailor
and
i
never
thought
of
that
this
was
in
reality
the
only
way
by
which
to
penetrate
into
granite
house
so
as
to
fight
with
and
drive
out
the
intruders
the
opening
was
it
is
true
closed
up
with
a
wall
of
cemented
stones
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
sacrifice
but
that
could
easily
be
rebuilt
fortunately
cyrus
harding
had
not
as
yet
effected
his
project
of
hiding
this
opening
by
raising
the
waters
of
the
lake
for
the
operation
would
then
have
taken
some
time
it
was
already
past
twelve
oclock
when
the
colonists
well
armed
and
provided
with
picks
and
spades
left
the
chimneys
passed
beneath
the
windows
of
granite
house
after
telling
top
to
remain
at
his
post
and
began
to
ascend
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
so
as
to
reach
prospect
heights
but
they
had
not
made
fifty
steps
in
this
direction
when
they
heard
the
dog
barking
furiously
and
all
rushed
down
the
bank
again
arrived
at
the
turning
they
saw
that
the
situation
had
changed
in
fact
the
apes
seized
with
a
sudden
panic
from
some
unknown
cause
were
trying
to
escape
two
or
three
ran
and
clambered
from
one
window
to
another
with
the
agility
of
acrobats
they
were
not
even
trying
to
replace
the
ladder
by
which
it
would
have
been
easy
to
descend
perhaps
in
their
terror
they
had
forgotten
this
way
of
escape
the
colonists
now
being
able
to
take
aim
without
difficulty
fired
some
wounded
or
killed
fell
back
into
the
rooms
uttering
piercing
cries
the
rest
throwing
themselves
out
were
dashed
to
pieces
in
their
fall
and
in
a
few
minutes
so
far
as
they
knew
there
was
not
a
living
quadrumana
in
granite
house
at
this
moment
the
ladder
was
seen
to
slip
over
the
threshold
then
unroll
and
fall
to
the
ground
hullo
cried
the
sailor
this
is
queer
very
strange
murmured
the
engineer
leaping
first
up
the
ladder
take
care
captain
cried
pencroft
perhaps
there
are
still
some
of
these
rascals
we
shall
soon
see
replied
the
engineer
without
stopping
however
all
his
companions
followed
him
and
in
a
minute
they
had
arrived
at
the
threshold
they
searched
everywhere
there
was
no
one
in
the
rooms
nor
in
the
storehouse
which
had
been
respected
by
the
band
of
quadrumana
well
now
and
the
ladder
cried
the
sailor
who
can
the
gentleman
have
been
who
sent
us
that
down
but
at
that
moment
a
cry
was
heard
and
a
great
orang
who
had
hidden
himself
in
the
passage
rushed
into
the
room
pursued
by
neb
ah
the
robber
cried
pencroft
and
hatchet
in
hand
he
was
about
to
cleave
the
head
of
the
animal
when
cyrus
harding
seized
his
arm
saying
spare
him
pencroft
pardon
this
rascal
yes
it
was
he
who
threw
us
the
ladder
and
the
engineer
said
this
in
such
a
peculiar
voice
that
it
was
difficult
to
know
whether
he
spoke
seriously
or
not
nevertheless
they
threw
themselves
on
the
orang
who
defended
himself
gallantly
but
was
soon
overpowered
and
bound
there
said
pencroft
and
what
shall
we
make
of
him
now
weve
got
him
a
servant
replied
herbert
the
lad
was
not
joking
in
saying
this
for
he
knew
how
this
intelligent
race
could
be
turned
to
account
the
settlers
then
approached
the
ape
and
gazed
at
it
attentively
he
belonged
to
the
family
of
anthropoid
apes
of
which
the
facial
angle
is
not
much
inferior
to
that
of
the
australians
and
hottentots
it
was
an
orangoutang
and
as
such
had
neither
the
ferocity
of
the
gorilla
nor
the
stupidity
of
the
baboon
it
is
to
this
family
of
the
anthropoid
apes
that
so
many
characteristics
belong
which
prove
them
to
be
possessed
of
an
almost
human
intelligence
employed
in
houses
they
can
wait
at
table
sweep
rooms
brush
clothes
clean
boots
handle
a
knife
fork
and
spoon
properly
and
even
drink
wine
doing
everything
as
well
as
the
best
servant
that
ever
walked
upon
two
legs
buffon
possessed
one
of
these
apes
who
served
him
for
a
long
time
as
a
faithful
and
zealous
servant
the
one
which
had
been
seized
in
the
hall
of
granite
house
was
a
great
fellow
six
feet
high
with
an
admirably
poportioned
frame
a
broad
chest
head
of
a
moderate
size
the
facial
angle
reaching
sixtyfive
degrees
round
skull
projecting
nose
skin
covered
with
soft
glossy
hair
in
short
a
fine
specimen
of
the
anthropoids
his
eyes
rather
smaller
than
human
eyes
sparkled
with
intelligence
his
white
teeth
glittered
under
his
mustache
and
he
wore
a
little
curly
brown
beard
a
handsome
fellow
said
pencroft
if
we
only
knew
his
language
we
could
talk
to
him
but
master
said
neb
are
you
serious
are
we
going
to
take
him
as
a
servant
yes
neb
replied
the
engineer
smiling
but
you
must
not
be
jealous
and
i
hope
he
will
make
an
excellent
servant
added
herbert
he
appears
young
and
will
be
easy
to
educate
and
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
use
force
to
subdue
him
nor
draw
his
teeth
as
is
sometimes
done
he
will
soon
grow
fond
of
his
masters
if
they
are
kind
to
him
and
they
will
be
replied
pencroft
who
had
forgotten
all
his
rancor
against
the
jokers
then
approaching
the
orang
well
old
boy
he
asked
how
are
you
the
orang
replied
by
a
little
grunt
which
did
not
show
any
anger
you
wish
to
join
the
colony
again
asked
the
sailor
you
are
going
to
enter
the
service
of
captain
cyrus
harding
another
respondent
grunt
was
uttered
by
the
ape
and
you
will
be
satisfied
with
no
other
wages
than
your
food
third
affirmative
grunt
this
conversation
is
slightly
monotonous
observed
gideon
spilett
so
much
the
better
replied
pencroft
the
best
servants
are
those
who
talk
the
least
and
then
no
wages
do
you
hear
my
boy
we
will
give
you
no
wages
at
first
but
we
will
double
them
afterwards
if
we
are
pleased
with
you
thus
the
colony
was
increased
by
a
new
member
as
to
his
name
the
sailor
begged
that
in
memory
of
another
ape
which
he
had
known
he
might
be
called
jupiter
and
jup
for
short
and
so
without
more
ceremony
master
jup
was
installed
in
granite
house
chapter
7
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
had
now
regained
their
dwelling
without
having
been
obliged
to
reach
it
by
the
old
opening
and
were
therefore
spared
the
trouble
of
masons
work
it
was
certainly
lucky
that
at
the
moment
they
were
about
to
set
out
to
do
so
the
apes
had
been
seized
with
that
terror
no
less
sudden
than
inexplicable
which
had
driven
them
out
of
granite
house
had
the
animals
discovered
that
they
were
about
to
be
attacked
from
another
direction
this
was
the
only
explanation
of
their
sudden
retreat
during
the
day
the
bodies
of
the
apes
were
carried
into
the
wood
where
they
were
buried
then
the
settlers
busied
themselves
in
repairing
the
disorder
caused
by
the
intruders
disorder
but
not
damage
for
although
they
had
turned
everything
in
the
rooms
topsyturvy
yet
they
had
broken
nothing
neb
relighted
his
stove
and
the
stores
in
the
larder
furnished
a
substantial
repast
to
which
all
did
ample
justice
jup
was
not
forgotten
and
he
ate
with
relish
some
stonepine
almonds
and
rhizome
roots
with
which
he
was
abundantly
supplied
pencroft
had
unfastened
his
arms
but
judged
it
best
to
have
his
legs
tied
until
they
were
more
sure
of
his
submission
then
before
retiring
to
rest
harding
and
his
companions
seated
round
their
table
discussed
those
plans
the
execution
of
which
was
most
pressing
the
most
important
and
most
urgent
was
the
establishment
of
a
bridge
over
the
mercy
so
as
to
form
a
communication
with
the
southern
part
of
the
island
and
granite
house
then
the
making
of
an
enclosure
for
the
musmons
or
other
woolly
animals
which
they
wished
to
capture
these
two
projects
would
help
to
solve
the
difficulty
as
to
their
clothing
which
was
now
serious
the
bridge
would
render
easy
the
transport
of
the
balloon
case
which
would
furnish
them
with
linen
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
enclosure
would
yield
wool
which
would
supply
them
with
winter
clothes
as
to
the
enclosure
it
was
cyrus
hardings
intention
to
establish
it
at
the
sources
of
the
red
creek
where
the
ruminants
would
find
fresh
and
abundant
pasture
the
road
between
prospect
heights
and
the
sources
of
the
stream
was
already
partly
beaten
and
with
a
better
cart
than
the
first
the
material
could
be
easily
conveyed
to
the
spot
especially
if
they
could
manage
to
capture
some
animals
to
draw
it
but
though
there
might
be
no
inconvenience
in
the
enclosure
being
so
far
from
granite
house
it
would
not
be
the
same
with
the
poultryyard
to
which
neb
called
the
attention
of
the
colonists
it
was
indeed
necessary
that
the
birds
should
be
close
within
reach
of
the
cook
and
no
place
appeared
more
favorable
for
the
establishment
of
the
said
poultryyard
than
that
portion
of
the
banks
of
the
lake
which
was
close
to
the
old
opening
waterbirds
would
prosper
there
as
well
as
others
and
the
couple
of
tinamous
taken
in
their
last
excursion
would
be
the
first
to
be
domesticated
the
next
day
the
3rd
of
november
the
new
works
were
begun
by
the
construction
of
the
bridge
and
all
hands
were
required
for
this
important
task
saws
hatchets
and
hammers
were
shouldered
by
the
settlers
who
now
transformed
into
carpenters
descended
to
the
shore
there
pencroft
observed
suppose
that
during
our
absence
master
jup
takes
it
into
his
head
to
draw
up
the
ladder
which
he
so
politely
returned
to
us
yesterday
let
us
tie
its
lower
end
down
firmly
replied
cyrus
harding
this
was
done
by
means
of
two
stakes
securely
fixed
in
the
sand
then
the
settlers
ascending
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
soon
arrived
at
the
angle
formed
by
the
river
there
they
halted
in
order
to
ascertain
if
the
bridge
could
be
thrown
across
the
place
appeared
suitable
in
fact
from
this
spot
to
port
balloon
discovered
the
day
before
on
the
southern
coast
there
was
only
a
distance
of
three
miles
and
a
half
and
from
the
bridge
to
the
port
it
would
be
easy
to
make
a
good
cartroad
which
would
render
the
communication
between
granite
house
and
the
south
of
the
island
extremely
easy
cyrus
harding
now
imparted
to
his
companions
a
scheme
for
completely
isolating
prospect
heights
so
as
to
shelter
it
from
the
attacks
both
of
quadrupeds
and
quadrumana
in
this
way
granite
house
the
chimneys
the
poultryyard
and
all
the
upper
part
of
the
plateau
which
was
to
be
used
for
cultivation
would
be
protected
against
the
depredations
of
animals
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
execute
this
project
and
this
is
how
the
engineer
intended
to
set
to
work
the
plateau
was
already
defended
on
three
sides
by
watercourses
either
artificial
or
natural
on
the
northwest
by
the
shores
of
lake
grant
from
the
entrance
of
the
passage
to
the
breach
made
in
the
banks
of
the
lake
for
the
escape
of
the
water
on
the
north
from
this
breach
to
the
sea
by
the
new
watercourse
which
had
hollowed
out
a
bed
for
itself
across
the
plateau
and
shore
above
and
below
the
fall
and
it
would
be
enough
to
dig
the
bed
of
this
creek
a
little
deeper
to
make
it
impracticable
for
animals
on
all
the
eastern
border
by
the
sea
itself
from
the
mouth
of
the
aforesaid
creek
to
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
lastly
on
the
south
from
the
mouth
to
the
turn
of
the
mercy
where
the
bridge
was
to
be
established
the
western
border
of
the
plateau
now
remained
between
the
turn
of
the
river
and
the
southern
angle
of
the
lake
a
distance
of
about
a
mile
which
was
open
to
all
comers
but
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
dig
a
broad
deep
ditch
which
could
be
filled
from
the
lake
and
the
overflow
of
which
would
throw
itself
by
a
rapid
fall
into
the
bed
of
the
mercy
the
level
of
the
lake
would
no
doubt
be
somewhat
lowered
by
this
fresh
discharge
of
its
waters
but
cyrus
harding
had
ascertained
that
the
volume
of
water
in
the
red
creek
was
considerable
enough
to
allow
of
the
execution
of
this
project
so
then
added
the
engineer
prospect
heights
will
become
a
regular
island
being
surrounded
with
water
on
all
sides
and
only
communicating
with
the
rest
of
our
domain
by
the
bridge
which
we
are
about
to
throw
across
the
mercy
the
two
little
bridges
already
established
above
and
below
the
fall
and
lastly
two
other
little
bridges
which
must
be
constructed
one
over
the
canal
which
i
propose
to
dig
the
other
across
to
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
now
if
these
bridges
can
be
raised
at
will
prospect
heights
will
be
guarded
from
any
surprise
the
bridge
was
the
most
urgent
work
trees
were
selected
cut
down
stripped
of
their
branches
and
cut
into
beams
joists
and
planks
the
end
of
the
bridge
which
rested
on
the
right
bank
of
the
mercy
was
to
be
firm
but
the
other
end
on
the
left
bank
was
to
be
movable
so
that
it
might
be
raised
by
means
of
a
counterpoise
as
some
canal
bridges
are
managed
this
was
certainly
a
considerable
work
and
though
it
was
skillfully
conducted
it
took
some
time
for
the
mercy
at
this
place
was
eighty
feet
wide
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
fix
piles
in
the
bed
of
the
river
so
as
to
sustain
the
floor
of
the
bridge
and
establish
a
piledriver
to
act
on
the
tops
of
these
piles
which
would
thus
form
two
arches
and
allow
the
bridge
to
support
heavy
loads
happily
there
was
no
want
of
tools
with
which
to
shape
the
wood
nor
of
ironwork
to
make
it
firm
nor
of
the
ingenuity
of
a
man
who
had
a
marvelous
knowledge
of
the
work
nor
lastly
the
zeal
of
his
companions
who
in
seven
months
had
necessarily
acquired
great
skill
in
the
use
of
their
tools
and
it
must
be
said
that
not
the
least
skilful
was
gideon
spilett
who
in
dexterity
almost
equaled
the
sailor
himself
who
would
ever
have
expected
so
much
from
a
newspaper
man
thought
pencroft
the
construction
of
the
mercy
bridge
lasted
three
weeks
of
regular
hard
work
they
even
breakfasted
on
the
scene
of
their
labors
and
the
weather
being
magnificent
they
only
returned
to
granite
house
to
sleep
during
this
period
it
may
be
stated
that
master
jup
grew
more
accustomed
to
his
new
masters
whose
movements
he
always
watched
with
very
inquisitive
eyes
however
as
a
precautionary
measure
pencroft
did
not
as
yet
allow
him
complete
liberty
rightly
wishing
to
wait
until
the
limits
of
the
plateau
should
be
settled
by
the
projected
works
top
and
jup
were
good
friends
and
played
willingly
together
but
jup
did
everything
solemnly
on
the
20th
of
november
the
bridge
was
finished
the
movable
part
balanced
by
the
counterpoise
swung
easily
and
only
a
slight
effort
was
needed
to
raise
it
between
its
hinge
and
the
last
crossbar
on
which
it
rested
when
closed
there
existed
a
space
of
twenty
feet
which
was
sufficiently
wide
to
prevent
any
animals
from
crossing
the
settlers
now
began
to
talk
of
fetching
the
ballooncase
which
they
were
anxious
to
place
in
perfect
security
but
to
bring
it
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
a
cart
to
port
balloon
and
consequently
necessary
to
beat
a
road
through
the
dense
forests
of
the
far
west
this
would
take
some
time
also
neb
and
pencroft
having
gone
to
examine
into
the
state
of
things
at
port
balloon
and
reported
that
the
stock
of
cloth
would
suffer
no
damage
in
the
grotto
where
it
was
stored
it
was
decided
that
the
work
at
prospect
heights
should
not
be
discontinued
that
observed
pencroft
will
enable
us
to
establish
our
poultryyard
under
better
conditions
since
we
need
have
no
fear
of
visits
from
foxes
nor
the
attacks
of
other
beasts
then
added
neb
we
can
clear
the
plateau
and
transplant
wild
plants
to
it
and
prepare
our
second
cornfield
cried
the
sailor
with
a
triumphant
air
in
fact
the
first
cornfield
sown
with
a
single
grain
had
prospered
admirably
thanks
to
pencrofts
care
it
had
produced
the
ten
ears
foretold
by
the
engineer
and
each
ear
containing
eighty
grains
the
colony
found
itself
in
possession
of
eight
hundred
grains
in
six
months
which
promised
a
double
harvest
each
year
these
eight
hundred
grains
except
fifty
which
were
prudently
reserved
were
to
be
sown
in
a
new
field
but
with
no
less
care
than
was
bestowed
on
the
single
grain
the
field
was
prepared
then
surrounded
with
a
strong
palisade
high
and
pointed
which
quadrupeds
would
have
found
difficulty
in
leaping
as
to
birds
some
scarecrows
due
to
pencrofts
ingenious
brain
were
enough
to
frighten
them
the
seven
hundred
and
fifty
grains
deposited
in
very
regular
furrows
were
then
left
for
nature
to
do
the
rest
on
the
21st
of
november
cyrus
harding
began
to
plan
the
canal
which
was
to
close
the
plateau
on
the
west
from
the
south
angle
of
lake
grant
to
the
angle
of
the
mercy
there
was
there
two
or
three
feet
of
vegetable
earth
and
below
that
granite
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
manufacture
some
more
nitroglycerine
and
the
nitroglycerine
did
its
accustomed
work
in
less
than
a
fortnight
a
ditch
twelve
feet
wide
and
six
deep
was
dug
out
in
the
hard
ground
of
the
plateau
a
new
trench
was
made
by
the
same
means
in
the
rocky
border
of
the
lake
forming
a
small
stream
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
creek
glycerine
and
which
was
thus
an
affluent
of
the
mercy
as
the
engineer
had
predicted
the
level
of
the
lake
was
lowered
though
very
slightly
to
complete
the
enclosure
the
bed
of
the
stream
on
the
beach
was
considerably
enlarged
and
the
sand
supported
by
means
of
stakes
by
the
end
of
the
first
fortnight
of
december
these
works
were
finished
and
prospect
heightsthat
is
to
say
a
sort
of
irregular
pentagon
having
a
perimeter
of
nearly
four
miles
surrounded
by
a
liquid
beltwas
completely
protected
from
depredators
of
every
description
during
the
month
of
december
the
heat
was
very
great
in
spite
of
it
however
the
settlers
continued
their
work
and
as
they
were
anxious
to
possess
a
poultryyard
they
forthwith
commenced
it
it
is
useless
to
say
that
since
the
enclosing
of
the
plateau
had
been
completed
master
jup
had
been
set
at
liberty
he
did
not
leave
his
masters
and
evinced
no
wish
to
escape
he
was
a
gentle
animal
though
very
powerful
and
wonderfully
active
he
was
already
taught
to
make
himself
useful
by
drawing
loads
of
wood
and
carting
away
the
stones
which
were
extracted
from
the
bed
of
creek
glycerine
the
poultryyard
occupied
an
area
of
two
hundred
square
yards
on
the
southeastern
bank
of
the
lake
it
was
surrounded
by
a
palisade
and
in
it
were
constructed
various
shelters
for
the
birds
which
were
to
populate
it
these
were
simply
built
of
branches
and
divided
into
compartments
made
ready
for
the
expected
guests
the
first
were
the
two
tinamous
which
were
not
long
in
having
a
number
of
young
ones
they
had
for
companions
half
a
dozen
ducks
accustomed
to
the
borders
of
the
lake
some
belonged
to
the
chinese
species
of
which
the
wings
open
like
a
fan
and
which
by
the
brilliancy
of
their
plumage
rival
the
golden
pheasants
a
few
days
afterwards
herbert
snared
a
couple
of
gallinaceae
with
spreading
tails
composed
of
long
feathers
magnificent
alectors
which
soon
became
tame
as
to
pelicans
kingfishers
waterhens
they
came
of
themselves
to
the
shores
of
the
poultryyard
and
this
little
community
after
some
disputes
cooing
screaming
clucking
ended
by
settling
down
peacefully
and
increased
in
encouraging
proportion
for
the
future
use
of
the
colony
cyrus
harding
wishing
to
complete
his
performance
established
a
pigeonhouse
in
a
corner
of
the
poultryyard
there
he
lodged
a
dozen
of
those
pigeons
which
frequented
the
rocks
of
the
plateau
these
birds
soon
became
accustomed
to
returning
every
evening
to
their
new
dwelling
and
showed
more
disposition
to
domesticate
themselves
than
their
congeners
the
woodpigeons
lastly
the
time
had
come
for
turning
the
ballooncase
to
use
by
cutting
it
up
to
make
shirts
and
other
articles
for
as
to
keeping
it
in
its
present
form
and
risking
themselves
in
a
balloon
filled
with
gas
above
a
sea
of
the
limits
of
which
they
had
no
idea
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
it
was
necessary
to
bring
the
case
to
granite
house
and
the
colonists
employed
themselves
in
rendering
their
heavy
cart
lighter
and
more
manageable
but
though
they
had
a
vehicle
the
moving
power
was
yet
to
be
found
but
did
there
not
exist
in
the
island
some
animal
which
might
supply
the
place
of
the
horse
ass
or
ox
that
was
the
question
certainly
said
pencroft
a
beast
of
burden
would
be
very
useful
to
us
until
the
captain
has
made
a
steam
cart
or
even
an
engine
for
some
day
we
shall
have
a
railroad
from
granite
house
to
port
balloon
with
a
branch
line
to
mount
franklin
one
day
the
23rd
of
december
neb
and
top
were
heard
shouting
and
barking
each
apparently
trying
to
see
who
could
make
the
most
noise
the
settlers
who
were
busy
at
the
chimneys
ran
fearing
some
vexatious
incident
what
did
they
see
two
fine
animals
of
a
large
size
that
had
imprudently
ventured
on
the
plateau
when
the
bridges
were
open
one
would
have
said
they
were
horses
or
at
least
donkeys
male
and
female
of
a
fine
shape
dovecolored
the
legs
and
tail
white
striped
with
black
on
the
head
and
neck
they
advanced
quietly
without
showing
any
uneasiness
and
gazed
at
the
men
in
whom
they
could
not
as
yet
recognize
their
future
masters
these
are
onagers
cried
herbert
animals
something
between
the
zebra
and
the
quagga
why
not
donkeys
asked
neb
because
they
have
not
long
ears
and
their
shape
is
more
graceful
donkeys
or
horses
interrupted
pencroft
they
are
moving
powers
as
the
captain
would
say
and
as
such
must
be
captured
the
sailor
without
frightening
the
animals
crept
through
the
grass
to
the
bridge
over
creek
glycerine
lowered
it
and
the
onagers
were
prisoners
now
should
they
seize
them
with
violence
and
master
them
by
force
no
it
was
decided
that
for
a
few
days
they
should
be
allowed
to
roam
freely
about
the
plateau
where
there
was
an
abundance
of
grass
and
the
engineer
immediately
began
to
prepare
a
stable
near
the
poultryyard
in
which
the
onagers
might
find
food
with
a
good
litter
and
shelter
during
the
night
this
done
the
movements
of
the
two
magnificent
creatures
were
left
entirely
free
and
the
settlers
avoided
even
approaching
them
so
as
to
terrify
them
several
times
however
the
onagers
appeared
to
wish
to
leave
the
plateau
too
confined
for
animals
accustomed
to
the
plains
and
forests
they
were
then
seen
following
the
waterbarrier
which
everywhere
presented
itself
before
them
uttering
short
neighs
then
galloping
through
the
grass
and
becoming
calmer
they
would
remain
entire
hours
gazing
at
the
woods
from
which
they
were
cut
off
for
ever
in
the
meantime
harness
of
vegetable
fiber
had
been
manufactured
and
some
days
after
the
capture
of
the
onagers
not
only
the
cart
was
ready
but
a
straight
road
or
rather
a
cutting
had
been
made
through
the
forests
of
the
far
west
from
the
angle
of
the
mercy
to
port
balloon
the
cart
might
then
be
driven
there
and
towards
the
end
of
december
they
tried
the
onagers
for
the
first
time
pencroft
had
already
coaxed
the
animals
to
come
and
eat
out
of
his
hand
and
they
allowed
him
to
approach
without
making
any
difficulty
but
once
harnessed
they
reared
and
could
with
difficulty
be
held
in
however
it
was
not
long
before
they
submitted
to
this
new
service
for
the
onager
being
less
refractory
than
the
zebra
is
frequently
put
in
harness
in
the
mountainous
regions
of
southern
africa
and
it
has
even
been
acclimatized
in
europe
under
zones
of
a
relative
coolness
on
this
day

were

over

rough

the

arrived
without

was

loaded

chapter
8
the
first
week
of
january
was
devoted
to
the
manufacture
of
the
linen
garments
required
by
the
colony
the
needles
found
in
the
box
were
used
by
sturdy
if
not
delicate
fingers
and
we
may
be
sure
that
what
was
sewn
was
sewn
firmly
there
was
no
lack
of
thread
thanks
to
cyrus
hardings
idea
of
reemploying
that
which
had
been
already
used
in
the
covering
of
the
balloon
this
with
admirable
patience
was
all
unpicked
by
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
for
pencroft
had
been
obliged
to
give
this
work
up
as
it
irritated
him
beyond
measure
but
he
had
no
equal
in
the
sewing
part
of
the
business
indeed
everybody
knows
that
sailors
have
a
remarkable
aptitude
for
tailoring
the
cloth
of
which
the
ballooncase
was
made
was
then
cleaned
by
means
of
soda
and
potash
obtained
by
the
incineration
of
plants
in
such
a
way
that
the
cotton
having
got
rid
of
the
varnish
resumed
its
natural
softness
and
elasticity
then
exposed
to
the
action
of
the
atmosphere
it
soon
became
perfectly
white
some
dozen
shirts
and
sockthe
latter
not
knitted
of
course
but
made
of
cottonwere
thus
manufactured
what
a
comfort
it
was
to
the
settlers
to
clothe
themselves
again
in
clean
linen
which
was
doubtless
rather
rough
but
they
were
not
troubled
about
that
and
then
to
go
to
sleep
between
sheets
which
made
the
couches
at
granite
house
into
quite
comfortable
beds
it
was
about
this
time
also
that
they
made
boots
of
sealleather
which
were
greatly
needed
to
replace
the
shoes
and
boots
brought
from
america
we
may
be
sure
that
these
new
shoes
were
large
enough
and
never
pinched
the
feet
of
the
wearers
with
the
beginning
of
the
year
1866
the
heat
was
very
great
but
the
hunting
in
the
forests
did
not
stand
still
agouties
peccaries
capybaras
kangaroos
game
of
all
sorts
actually
swarmed
there
and
spilett
and
herbert
were
too
good
marksmen
ever
to
throw
away
their
shot
uselessly
cyrus
harding
still
recommended
them
to
husband
the
ammunition
and
he
took
measures
to
replace
the
powder
and
shot
which
had
been
found
in
the
box
and
which
he
wished
to
reserve
for
the
future
how
did
he
know
where
chance
might
one
day
cast
his
companions
and
himself
in
the
event
of
their
leaving
their
domain
they
should
then
prepare
for
the
unknown
future
by
husbanding
their
ammunition
and
by
substituting
for
it
some
easily
renewable
substance
to
replace
lead
of
which
harding
had
found
no
traces
in
the
island
he
employed
granulated
iron
which
was
easy
to
manufacture
these
bullets
not
having
the
weight
of
leaden
bullets
were
made
larger
and
each
charge
contained
less
but
the
skill
of
the
sportsmen
made
up
this
deficiency
as
to
powder
cyrus
harding
would
have
been
able
to
make
that
also
for
he
had
at
his
disposal
saltpeter
sulphur
and
coal
but
this
preparation
requires
extreme
care
and
without
special
tools
it
is
difficult
to
produce
it
of
a
good
quality
harding
preferred
therefore
to
manufacture
pyroxyle
that
is
to
say
guncotton
a
substance
in
which
cotton
is
not
indispensable
as
the
elementary
tissue
of
vegetables
may
be
used
and
this
is
found
in
an
almost
pure
state
not
only
in
cotton
but
in
the
textile
fiber
of
hemp
and
flax
in
paper
the
pith
of
the
elder
etc
now
the
elder
abounded
in
the
island
towards
the
mouth
of
red
creek
and
the
colonists
had
already
made
coffee
of
the
berries
of
these
shrubs
which
belong
to
the
family
of
the
caprifoliaceae
the
only
thing
to
be
collected
therefore
was
elderpith
for
as
to
the
other
substance
necessary
for
the
manufacture
of
pyroxyle
it
was
only
fuming
azotic
acid
now
harding
having
sulphuric
acid
at
his
disposal
had
already
been
easily
able
to
produce
azotic
acid
by
attacking
the
saltpeter
with
which
nature
supplied
him
he
accordingly
resolved
to
manufacture
and
employ
pyroxyle
although
it
has
some
inconveniences
that
is
to
say
a
great
inequality
of
effect
an
excessive
inflammability
since
it
takes
fire
at
one
hundred
and
seventy
degrees
instead
of
two
hundred
and
forty
and
lastly
an
instantaneous
deflagration
which
might
damage
the
firearms
on
the
other
hand
the
advantages
of
pyroxyle
consist
in
this
that
it
is
not
injured
by
damp
that
it
does
not
make
the
gunbarrels
dirty
and
that
its
force
is
four
times
that
of
ordinary
powder
to
make
pyroxyle
the
cotton
must
be
immersed
in
the
fuming
azotic
acid
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
washed
in
cold
water
and
dried
nothing
could
be
more
simple
cyrus
harding
had
only
at
his
disposal
the
ordinary
azotic
acid
and
not
the
fuming
or
monohydrate
azotic
acid
that
is
to
say
acid
which
emits
white
vapors
when
it
comes
in
contact
with
damp
air
but
by
substituting
for
the
latter
ordinary
azotic
acid
mixed
in
the
proportion
of
from
three
to
five
volumes
of
concentrated
sulphuric
acid
the
engineer
obtained
the
same
result
the
sportsmen
of
the
island
therefore
soon
had
a
perfectly
prepared
substance
which
employed
discreetly
produced
admirable
results
about
this
time
the
settlers
cleared
three
acres
of
the
plateau
and
the
rest
was
preserved
in
a
wild
state
for
the
benefit
of
the
onagers
several
excursions
were
made
into
the
jacamar
wood
and
the
forests
of
the
far
west
and
they
brought
back
from
thence
a
large
collection
of
wild
vegetables
spinach
cress
radishes
and
turnips
which
careful
culture
would
soon
improve
and
which
would
temper
the
regimen
on
which
the
settlers
had
till
then
subsisted
supplies
of
wood
and
coal
were
also
carted
each
excursion
was
at
the
same
time
a
means
of
improving
the
roads
which
gradually
became
smoother
under
the
wheels
of
the
cart
the
rabbitwarren
still
continued
to
supply
the
larder
of
granite
house
as
fortunately
it
was
situated
on
the
other
side
of
creek
glycerine
its
inhabitants
could
not
reach
the
plateau
nor
ravage
the
newlymade
plantation
the
oysterbed
among
the
rocks
was
frequently
renewed
and
furnished
excellent
molluscs
besides
that
the
fishing
either
in
the
lake
or
the
mercy
was
very
profitable
for
pencroft
had
made
some
lines
armed
with
iron
hooks
with
which
they
frequently
caught
fine
trout
and
a
species
of
fish
whose
silvery
sides
were
speckled
with
yellow
and
which
were
also
extremely
savory
master
neb
who
was
skilled
in
the
culinary
art
knew
how
to
vary
agreeably
the
bill
of
fare
bread
alone
was
wanting
at
the
table
of
the
settlers
and
as
has
been
said
they
felt
this
privation
greatly
the
settlers
hunted
too
the
turtles
which
frequented
the
shores
of
cape
mandible
at
this
place
the
beach
was
covered
with
little
mounds

observed
gideon

we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
pick
them
up
but
not
being
contented
with
simply
the
produce
they
made
chase
after
the
producers
the
result
of
which
was
that
they
were
able
to
bring
back
to
granite
house
a
dozen
of
these
chelonians

were

gained
wellmerited
praises
for
its

neb
we
must
here
mention
another
fortunate
circumstance
by
which
new
stores
for
the
winter
were
laid
in
shoals
of
salmon
entered
the
mercy
and
ascended
the
country
for
several
miles
it
was
the
time
at
which
the
females
going
to
find
suitable
places
in
which
to
spawn
precede
the
males
and
make
a
great
noise
through
the
fresh
water
a
thousand
of
these
fish
which
measured
about
two
feet
and
a
half
in
length
came
up
the
river
and
a
large
quantity
were
retained
by
fixing
dams
across
the
stream
more
than
a
hundred
were
thus
taken
which
were
salted
and
stored
for
the
time
when
winter
freezing
up
the
streams
would
render
fishing
impracticable

this
time
the

raised
to
the
duty
of

been
dressed
in
a
jacket

and
an
apron

were
his
delight
the
clever
orang
had
been
marvelously
trained
by
neb

any
one
would
have
said
that
the
negro
and
the
ape
understood
each
other
when
they
talked
together
jup
had
besides
a
real
affection
for
neb
and
neb
returned
it
when
his
services
were
not
required
either
for
carrying
wood
or
for
climbing
to
the
top
of
some
tree
jup
passed
the
greatest
part
of
his
time
in
the
kitchen
where
he
endeavored
to
imitate
neb
in
all
that
he
saw
him
do
the
black
showed
the
greatest
patience
and
even
extreme
zeal
in
instructing
his
pupil
and
the
pupil
exhibited
remarkable
intelligence
in
profiting
by
the
lessons
he
received
from
his
master
judge
then
of
the
pleasure
master
jup
gave
to
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
when
without
their
having
had
any
idea
of
it
he
appeared
one
day
napkin
on
his
arm
ready
to
wait
at
table
quick
attentive
he
acquitted
himself
perfectly
changing
the
plates
bringing
dishes
pouring
out
water
all
with
a
gravity
which
gave
intense
amusement
to
the
settlers

which
enraptured

nothing
was

but
that
and
jup
without
ever
being
disconcerted
replied
to
every
one
watched
for
everything
and
he
shook
his
head
in
a
knowing
way
when
pencroft
referring
to
his
joke
of
the
first
day
said
to
him
decidedly
jup
your
wages
must
be
doubled
it
is
useless
to
say
that
the
orang
was
now
thoroughly
domesticated
at
granite
house
and
that
he
often
accompanied
his
masters
to
the
forest
without
showing
any
wish
to
leave
them
it
was
most
amusing
to
see
him
walking
with
a
stick
which
pencroft
had
given
him
and
which
he
carried
on
his
shoulder
like
a
gun
if
they
wished
to
gather
some
fruit
from
the
summit
of
a
tree
how
quickly
he
climbed
for
it
if
the
wheel
of
the
cart
stuck
in
the
mud
with
what
energy
did
jup
with
a
single
heave
of
his
shoulder
put
it
right
again
what
a
jolly
fellow
he
is
cried
pencroft
often
if
he
was
as
mischievous
as
he
is
good
there
would
be
no
doing
anything
with
him
it
was
towards
the
end
of
january
the
colonists
began
their
labors
in
the
center
of
the
island
it
had
been
decided
that
a
corral
should
be
established
near
the
sources
of
the
red
creek
at
the
foot
of
mount
franklin
destined
to
contain
the
ruminants
whose
presence
would
have
been
troublesome
at
granite
house
and
especially
for
the
musmons
who
were
to
supply
the
wool
for
the
settlers
winter
garments
each
morning
the
colony
sometimes
entire
but
more
often
represented
only
by
harding
herbert
and
pencroft
proceeded
to
the
sources
of
the
creek
a
distance
of
not
more
than
five
miles
by
the
newly
beaten
road
to
which
the
name
of
corral
road
had
been
given
there
a
site
was
chosen
at
the
back
of
the
southern
ridge
of
the
mountain
it
was
a
meadow
land
dotted
here
and
there
with
clumps
of
trees
and
watered
by
a
little
stream
which
sprung
from
the
slopes
which
closed
it
in
on
one
side
the
grass
was
fresh
and
it
was
not
too
much
shaded
by
the
trees
which
grew
about
it
this
meadow
was
to
be
surrounded
by
a
palisade
high
enough
to
prevent
even
the
most
agile
animals
from
leaping
over
this
enclosure
would
be
large
enough
to
contain
a
hundred
musmons
and
wild
goats
with
all
the
young
ones
they
might
produce
the
perimeter
of
the
corral
was
then
traced
by
the
engineer
and
they
would
then
have
proceeded
to
fell
the
trees
necessary
for
the
construction
of
the
palisade
but
as
the
opening
up
of
the
road
had
already
necessitated
the
sacrifice
of
a
considerable
number
those
were
brought
and
supplied
a
hundred
stakes
which
were
firmly
fixed
in
the
ground
the
construction
of
this
corral
did
not
take
less
than
three
weeks
for
besides
the
palisade
cyrus
harding
built
large
sheds
in
which
the
animals
could
take
shelter
these
buildings
had
also
to
be
made
very
strong
for
musmons
are
powerful
animals
and
their
first
fury
was
to
be
feared
the
stakes
sharpened
at
their
upper
end
and
hardened
by
fire
had
been
fixed
by
means
of
crossbars
and
at
regular
distances
props
assured
the
solidity
of
the
whole
the
corral
finished
a
raid
had
to
be
made
on
the
pastures
frequented
by
the
ruminants
this
was
done
on
the
7th
of
february
on
a
beautiful
summers
day
and
every
one
took
part
in
it
the
onagers
already
well
trained
were
ridden
by
spilett
and
herbert
and
were
of
great
use
the
maneuver
consisted
simply
in
surrounding
the
musmons
and
goats
and
gradually
narrowing
the
circle
around
them
cyrus
harding
pencroft
neb
and
jup
posted
themselves
in
different
parts
of
the
wood
while
the
two
cavaliers
and
top
galloped
in
a
radius
of
half
a
mile
round
the
corral
the
musmons
were
very
numerous
in
this
part
of
the
island
these
fine
animals
were
as
large
as
deer
their
horns
were
stronger
than
those
of
the
ram
and
their
graycolored
fleece
was
mixed
with
long
hair
this
hunting
day
was
very
fatiguing
such
going
and
coming
and
running
and
riding
and
shouting
of
a
hundred
musmons
which
had
been
surrounded
more
than
twothirds
escaped
but
at
last
thirty
of
these
animals
and
ten
wild
goats
were
gradually
driven
back
towards
the
corral
the
open
door
of
which
appearing
to
offer
a
means
of
escape
they
rushed
in
and
were
prisoners
in
short
the
result
was
satisfactory
and
the
settlers
had
no
reason
to
complain
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
flock
would
prosper
and
that
at
no
distant
time
not
only
wool
but
hides
would
be
abundant
that
evening
the
hunters
returned
to
granite
house
quite
exhausted
however
notwithstanding
their
fatigue
they
returned
the
next
day
to
visit
the
corral
the
prisoners
had
been
trying
to
overthrow
the
palisade
but
of
course
had
not
succeeded
and
were
not
long
in
becoming
more
tranquil
during
the
month
of
february
no
event
of
any
importance
occurred
the
daily
labors
were
pursued
methodically
and
as
well
as
improving
the
roads
to
the
corral
and
to
port
balloon
a
third
was
commenced
which
starting
from
the
enclosure
proceeded
towards
the
western
coast
the
yet
unknown
portion
of
lincoln
island
was
that
of
the
woodcovered
serpentine
peninsula
which
sheltered
the
wild
beasts
from
which
gideon
spilett
was
so
anxious
to
clear
their
domain
before
the
cold
season
should
appear
the
most
assiduous
care
was
given
to
the
cultivation
of
the
wild
plants
which
had
been
transplanted
from
the
forest
to
prospect
heights
herbert
never
returned
from
an
excursion
without
bringing
home
some
useful
vegetable
one
day
it
was
some
specimens
of
the
chicory
tribe
the
seeds
of
which
by
pressure
yield
an
excellent
oil
another
it
was
some
common
sorrel
whose
antiscorbutic
qualities
were
not
to
be
despised
then
some
of
those
precious
tubers
which
have
at
all
times
been
cultivated
in
south
america
potatoes
of
which
more
than
two
hundred
species
are
now
known
the
kitchen
garden
now
well
stocked
and
carefully
defended
from
the
birds
was
divided
into
small
beds
where
grew
lettuces
kidney
potatoes
sorrel
turnips
radishes
and
other
coneiferae
the
soil
on
the
plateau
was
particularly
fertile
and
it
was
hoped
that
the
harvests
would
be
abundant
they
had
also
a
variety
of
different
beverages
and
so
long
as
they
did
not
demand
wine
the
most
hard
to
please
would
have
had
no
reason
to
complain
to
the
oswego
tea
and
the
fermented
liquor
extracted
from
the
roots
of
the
dragonnier
harding
had
added
a
regular
beer
made
from
the
young
shoots
of
the
sprucefir
which
after
having
been
boiled
and
fermented
made
that
agreeable
drink
called
by
the
angloamericans
springbeer
towards
the
end
of
the
summer
the
poultryyard
was
possessed
of
a
couple
of
fine
bustards
which
belonged
to
the
houbara
species
characterized
by
a
sort
of
feathery
mantle
a
dozen
shovelers
whose
upper
mandible
was
prolonged
on
each
side
by
a
membraneous
appendage
and
also
some
magnificent
cocks
similar
to
the
mozambique
cocks
the
comb
caruncle
and
epidermis
being
black
so
far
everything
had
succeeded
thanks
to
the
activity
of
these
courageous
and
intelligent
men
nature
did
much
for
them
doubtless
but
faithful
to
the
great
precept
they
made
a
right
use
of
what
a
bountiful
providence
gave
them
after
the
heat
of
these
warm
summer
days
in
the
evening
when
their
work
was
finished
and
the
seabreeze
began
to
blow
they
liked
to
sit
on
the
edge
of
prospect
heights
in
a
sort
of
veranda
covered
with
creepers
which
neb
had
made
with
his
own
hands
there
they
talked
they
instructed
each
other
they
made
plans
and
the
rough
goodhumor
of
the
sailor
always
amused
this
little
world
in
which
the
most
perfect
harmony
had
never
ceased
to
reign
they
often
spoke
of
their
country
of
their
dear
and
great
america
what
was
the
result
of
the
war
of
secession
it
could
not
have
been
greatly
prolonged
richmond
had
doubtless
soon
fallen
into
the
hands
of
general
grant
the
taking
of
the
capital
of
the
confederates
must
have
been
the
last
action
of
this
terrible
struggle
now
the
north
had
triumphed
in
the
good
cause
how
welcome
would
have
been
a
newspaper
to
the
exiles
in
lincoln
island
for
eleven
months
all
communication
between
them
and
the
rest
of
their
fellowcreatures
had
been
interrupted
and
in
a
short
time
the
24th
of
march
would
arrive
the
anniversary
of
the
day
on
which
the
balloon
had
thrown
them
on
this
unknown
coast
they
were
then
mere
castaways
not
even
knowing
how
they
should
preserve
their
miserable
lives
from
the
fury
of
the
elements
and
now
thanks
to
the
knowledge
of
their
captain
and
their
own
intelligence
they
were
regular
colonists
furnished
with
arms
tools
and
instruments
they
had
been
able
to
turn
to
their
profit
the
animals
plants
and
minerals
of
the
island
that
is
to
say
the
three
kingdoms
of
nature
yes
they
often
talked
of
all
these
things
and
formed
still
more
plans
as
to
cyrus
harding
he
was
for
the
most
part
silent
and
listened
to
his
companions
more
often
than
he
spoke
to
them
sometimes
he
smiled
at
herberts
ideas
or
pencrofts
nonsense
but
always
and
everywhere
he
pondered
over
those
inexplicable
facts
that
strange
enigma
of
which
the
secret
still
escaped
him

the
weather
changed
during
the
first
week
of
march
there
had
been
a
full
moon
at
the
commencement
of
the
month
and
the
heat
was
excessive
the
atmosphere
was
felt
to
be
full
of
electricity
and
a
period
of
some
length
of
tempestuous
weather
was
to
be
feared
indeed
on
the
2nd
peals
of
thunder
were
heard
the
wind
blew
from
the
east
and
hail
rattled
against
the
facade
of
granite
house
like
volleys
of
grapeshot
the
door
and
windows
were
immediately
closed
or
everything
in
the
rooms
would
have
been
drenched
on
seeing
these
hailstones
some
of
which
were
the
size
of
a
pigeons
egg
pencrofts
first
thought
was
that
his
cornfield
was
in
serious
danger
he
directly
rushed
to
his
field
where
little
green
heads
were
already
appearing
and
by
means
of
a
great
cloth
he
managed
to
protect
his
crop
this
bad
weather
lasted
a
week
during
which
time
the
thunder
rolled
without
cessation
in
the
depths
of
the
sky
the
colonists
not
having
any
pressing
work
out
of
doors
profited
by
the
bad
weather
to
work
at
the
interior
of
granite
house
the
arrangement
of
which
was
becoming
more
complete
from
day
to
day
the
engineer
made
a
turninglathe
with
which
he
turned
several
articles
both
for
the
toilet
and
the
kitchen
particularly
buttons
the
want
of
which
was
greatly
felt
a
gunrack
had
been
made
for
the
firearms
which
were
kept
with
extreme
care
and
neither
tables
nor
cupboards
were
left
incomplete
they
sawed
they
planed
they
filed
they
turned
and
during
the
whole
of
this
bad
season
nothing
was
heard
but
the
grinding
of
tools
or
the
humming
of
the
turninglathe
which
responded
to
the
growling
of
the
thunder
master
jup
had
not
been
forgotten
and
he
occupied
a
room
at
the
back
near
the
storeroom
a
sort
of
cabin
with
a
cot
always
full
of
good
litter
which
perfectly
suited
his
taste
with
good
old
jup

what
a

jup
was
now
well
used
to
service
he
brushed
their
clothes
he
turned
the
spit
he
waited
at
table
he
swept
the
rooms
he
gathered
wood
and
he
performed
another
admirable
piece
of
service
which
delighted
pencrofthe
never
went
to
sleep
without
first
coming
to
tuck
up

the
health
of
the
members

it
left
nothing
to
be
desired
with
their
life
in
the
open
air
on
this
salubrious
soil
under
that
temperate
zone
working
both
with
head
and
hands
they
could
not
suppose
that
illness
would
ever
attack
them
all
were
indeed
wonderfully
well
herbert
had
already
grown
two
inches
in
the
year
his
figure
was
forming
and
becoming
more
manly
and
he
promised
to
be
an
accomplished
man
physically
as
well
as
morally
besides
he
improved
himself
during
the
leisure
hours
which
manual
occupations
left
to
him
he
read
the
books
found
in
the
case
and
after
the
practical
lessons
which
were
taught
by
the
very
necessity
of
their
position
he
found
in
the
engineer
for
science
and
the
reporter
for
languages

who
were
delighted
to
complete
his
education
the
tempest
ended
about
the
9th
of
march
but
the
sky
remained
covered
with
clouds
during
the
whole
of
this
last
summer
month
the
atmosphere
violently
agitated
by
the
electric
commotions
could
not
recover
its
former
purity
and
there
was
almost
invariably
rain
and
fog
except
for
three
or
four
fine
days
on
which
several
excursions
were
made
about
this
time
the
female
onager
gave
birth
to
a
young
one
which
belonged
to
the
same
sex
as
its
mother
and
which
throve
capitally
in
the
corral
the
flock
of
musmons

also
increased

several

bleated
in
the

the
great
delight
of

and
herbert
who
had
each
their
favorite
among
these
newcomers
an
attempt
was
also
made
for
the
domestication
of
the
peccaries
which
succeeded
well
a
sty
was
constructed
under
the
poultryyard
and
soon
contained
several
young
ones

conscientiously
of

he
sometimes
amused
himself
at
the

of
his
little

by

this
was
mischief

reminded
cyrus
harding
of
a
promise
which
the
latter
had
not
as
yet
had
time
to
fulfil
you
once
spoke
of
an
apparatus
which
would
take
the
place
of
the
long
ladders
at
granite
house
captain
said
he
wont
you
make
it
some
day
nothing
will
be
easier
but
is
this
a
really
useful
thing
certainly
captain
after
we
have
given
ourselves
necessaries
let
us
think
a
little
of
luxury
for
us
it
may
be
luxury
if
you
like
but
for
things
it
is
necessary
it
isnt
very
convenient
to
climb
up
a
long
ladder
when
one
is
heavily
loaded
well
pencroft
we
will
try
to
please
you
replied
cyrus
harding
but
you
have
no
machine
at
your
disposal
we
will
make
one
a
steam
machine
no
a
water
machine
and
indeed
to
work
his
apparatus
there
was
already
a
natural
force
at
the
disposal
of
the
engineer
which
could
be
used
without
great
difficulty
for
this
it
was
enough
to
augment
the
flow
of
the
little
stream
which
supplied
the
interior
of
granite
house
with
water
the
opening
among
the
stones
and
grass
was
then
increased
thus
producing
a
strong
fall
at
the
bottom
of
the
passage
the
overflow
from
which
escaped
by
the
inner
well
below
this
fall
the
engineer
fixed
a
cylinder
with
paddles
which
was
joined
on
the
exterior
with
a
strong
cable
rolled
on
a
wheel
supporting
a
basket
in
this
way
by
means
of
a
long
rope
reaching
to
the
ground
which
enabled
them
to
regulate
the
motive
power
they
could
rise
in
the
basket
to
the
door
of
granite
house
it
was
on
the
17th
of
march
that
the
lift
acted
for
the
first
time
and
gave
universal
satisfaction
henceforward
all
the
loads
wood
coal
provisions
and
even
the
settlers
themselves
were
hoisted
by
this
simple
system
which
replaced
the
primitive
ladder
and
as
may
be
supposed
no
one
thought
of
regretting
the
change
top
particularly
was
enchanted
with
this
improvement
for
he
had
not
and
never
could
have
possessed
master
jups
skill
in
climbing
ladders
and
often
it
was
on
nebs
back
or
even
on
that
of
the
orang
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
make
the
ascent
to
granite
house
about
this
time
too
cyrus
harding
attempted
to
manufacture
glass
and
he
at
first
put
the
old
potterykiln
to
this
new
use
there
were
some
difficulties
to
be
encountered
but
after
several
fruitless
attempts
he
succeeded
in
setting
up
a
glass
manufactory
which
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
his
usual
assistants
did
not
leave
for
several
days
as
to
the
substances
used
in
the
composition
of
glass
they
are
simply
sand
chalk
and
soda
either
carbonate
or
sulphate
now
the
beach
supplied
sand
lime
supplied
chalk
seaweeds
supplied
soda
pyrites
supplied
sulphuric
acid
and
the
ground
supplied
coal
to
heat
the
kiln
to
the
wishedfor
temperature
cyrus
harding
thus
soon
had
everything
ready
for
setting
to
work
the
tool
the
manufacture
of
which
presented
the
most
difficulty
was
the
pipe
of
the
glassmaker
an
iron
tube
five
or
six
feet
long
which
collects
on
one
end
the
material
in
a
state
of
fusion
but
by
means
of
a
long
thin
piece
of
iron
rolled
up
like
the
barrel
of
a
gun
pencroft
succeeded
in
making
a
tube
soon
ready
for
use
on
the
28th
of
march
the
tube
was
heated
a
hundred
parts
of
sand
thirtyfive
of
chalk
forty
of
sulphate
of
soda
mixed
with
two
or
three
parts
of
powdered
coal
composed
the
substance
which
was
placed
in
crucibles
when
the
high
temperature
of
the
oven
had
reduced
it
to
a
liquid
or
rather
a
pasty
state
cyrus
harding
collected
with
the
tube
a
quantity
of
the
paste
he
turned
it
about
on
a
metal
plate
previously
arranged
so
as
to
give
it
a
form
suitable
for
blowing
then
he
passed
the
tube
to
herbert
telling
him
to
blow
at
the
other
extremity
and
herbert
swelling
out
his
cheeks
blew
so
much
and
so
well
into
the
tubetaking
care
to
twirl
it
round
at
the
same
timethat
his
breath
dilated
the
glassy
mass
other
quantities
of
the
substance
in
a
state
of
fusion
were
added
to
the
first
and
in
a
short
time
the
result
was
a
bubble
which
measured
a
foot
in
diameter
harding
then
took
the
tube
out
of
herberts
hands
and
giving
it
a
pendulous
motion
he
ended
by
lengthening
the
malleable
bubble
so
as
to
give
it
a
cylindroconic
shape
the
blowing
operation
had
given
a
cylinder
of
glass
terminated
by
two
hemispheric
caps
which
were
easily
detached
by
means
of
a
sharp
iron
dipped
in
cold
water
then
by
the
same
proceeding
this
cylinder
was
cut
lengthways
and
after
having
been
rendered
malleable
by
a
second
heating
it
was
extended
on
a
plate
and
spread
out
with
a
wooden
roller
the
first
pane
was
thus
manufactured
and
they
had
only
to
perform
this
operation
fifty
times
to
have
fifty
panes
the
windows
at
granite
house
were
soon
furnished
with
panes
not
very
white
perhaps
but
still
sufficiently
transparent
as
to
bottles
and
tumblers
that
was
only
play
they
were
satisfied
with
them
besides
just
as
they
came
from
the
end
of
the
tube
pencroft
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
blow
in
his
turn
and
it
was
great
fun
for
him
but
he
blew
so
hard
that
his
productions
took
the
most
ridiculous
shapes
which
he
admired
immensely
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
while
hunting
one
day
had
entered
the
forest
of
the
far
west
on
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
and
as
usual
the
lad
was
asking
a
thousand
questions
of
the
engineer
who
answered
them
heartily
now
as
harding
was
not
a
sportsman
and
as
on
the
other
side
herbert
was
talking
chemistry
and
natural
philosophy
numbers
of
kangaroos
capybaras
and
agouties
came
within
range
which
however
escaped
the
lads
gun
the
consequence
was
that
the
day
was
already
advanced
and
the
two
hunters
were
in
danger
of
having
made
a
useless
excursion
when
herbert
stopping
and
uttering
a
cry
of
joy
exclaimed
oh
captain
harding
do
you
see
that
tree
and
he
pointed
to
a
shrub
rather
than
a
tree
for
it
was
composed
of
a
single
stem
covered
with
a
scaly
bark
which
bore
leaves
streaked
with
little
parallel
veins
and
what
is
this
tree
which
resembles
a
little
palm
asked
harding
it
is
a
cycas
revoluta
of
which
i
have
a
picture
in
our
dictionary
of
natural
history
said
herbert
but
i
cant
see
any
fruit
on
this
shrub
observed
his
companion
no
captain
replied
herbert
but
its
stem
contains
a
flour
with
which
nature
has
provided
us
all
ready
ground
it
is
then
the
breadtree
yes
the
breadtree
well
my
boy
replied
the
engineer
this
is
a
valuable
discovery
since
our
wheat
harvest
is
not
yet
ripe
i
hope
that
you
are
not
mistaken
herbert
was
not
mistaken
he
broke
the
stem
of
a
cycas
which
was
composed
of
a
glandulous
tissue
containing
a
quantity
of
floury
pith
traversed
with
woody
fiber
separated
by
rings
of
the
same
substance
arranged
concentrically
with
this
fecula
was
mingled
a
mucilaginous
juice
of
disagreeable
flavor
but
which
it
would
be
easy
to
get
rid
of
by
pressure
this
cellular
substance
was
regular
flour
of
a
superior
quality
extremely
nourishing
its
exportation
was
formerly
forbidden
by
the
japanese
laws
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
after
having
examined
that
part
of
the
far
west
where
the
cycas
grew
took
their
bearings
and
returned
to
granite
house
where
they
made
known
their
discovery
the
next
day
the
settlers
went
to
collect
some
and
returned
to
granite
house
with
an
ample
supply
of
cycas
stems
the
engineer
constructed
a
press
with
which
to
extract
the
mucilaginous
juice
mingled
with
the
fecula
and
he
obtained
a
large
quantity
of
flour
which
neb
soon
transformed
into
cakes
and
puddings
this
was
not
quite
real
wheaten
bread
but
it
was
very
like
it
now
too
the
onager
the
goats
and
the
sheep
in
the
corral
furnished
daily
the
milk
necessary
to
the
colony
the
cart
or
rather
a
sort
of
light
carriole
which
had
replaced
it
made
frequent
journeys
to
the
corral
and
when
it
was
pencrofts
turn
to
go
he
took
jup
and
let
him
drive
and
jup
cracking
his
whip
acquitted
himself
with
his
customary
intelligence
everything
prospered
as
well
in
the
corral
as
in
granite
house
and
certainly
the
settlers
if
it
had
not
been
that
they
were
so
far
from
their
native
land
had
no
reason
to
complain
they
were
so
well
suited
to
this
life
and
were
besides
so
accustomed
to
the
island
that
they
could
not
have
left
its
hospitable
soil
without
regret
and
yet
so
deeply
is
the
love
of
his
country
implanted
in
the
heart
of
man
that
if
a
ship
had
unexpectedly
come
in
sight
of
the
island
the
colonists
would
have
made
signals
would
have
attracted
her
attention
and
would
have
departed
it
was
the
1st
of
april
a
sunday
easter
day
which
harding
and
his
companions
sanctified
by
rest
and
prayer
the
day
was
fine
such
as
an
october
day
in
the
northern
hemisphere
might
be
all
towards
the
evening
after
dinner
were
seated
under
the
veranda
on
the
edge
of
prospect
heights
and
they
were
watching
the
darkness
creeping
up
from
the
horizon
some
cups
of
the
infusion
of
elderberries
which
took
the
place
of
coffee
had
been
served
by
neb
they
were
speaking
of
the
island
and
of
its
isolated
situation
in
the
pacific
which
led
gideon
spilett
to
say
my
dear
cyrus
have
you
ever
since
you
possessed
the
sextant
found
in
the
case
again
taken
the
position
of
our
island
no
replied
the
engineer
but
it
would
perhaps
be
a
good
thing
to
do
it
with
this
instrument
which
is
more
perfect
than
that
which
you
before
used
what
is
the
good
said
pencroft
the
island
is
quite
comfortable
where
it
is
well
who
knows
returned
the
reporter
who
knows
but
that
we
may
be
much
nearer
inhabited
land
than
we
think
we
shall
know
tomorrow
replied
cyrus
harding
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
occupations
which
left
me
no
leisure
we
should
have
known
it
already
good
said
pencroft
the
captain
is
too
good
an
observer
to
be
mistaken
and
if
it
has
not
moved
from
its
place
the
island
is
just
where
he
put
it
we
shall
see
on
the
next
day
therefore
by
means
of
the
sextant
the
engineer
made
the
necessary
observations
to
verify
the
position
which
he
had
already
obtained
and
this
was
the
result
of
his
operation
his
first
observation
had
given
him
the
situation
of
lincoln
island
in
west
longitude
from
150deg
to
155deg
in
south
latitude
from
30deg
to
35deg
the
second
gave
exactly
in
longitude
150deg
30
in
south
latitude
34deg
57
so
then
notwithstanding
the
imperfection
of
his
apparatus
cyrus
harding
had
operated
with
so
much
skill
that
his
error
did
not
exceed
five
degrees
now
said
gideon
spilett
since
we
possess
an
atlas
as
well
as
a
sextant
let
us
see
my
dear
cyrus
the
exact
position
which
lincoln
island
occupies
in
the
pacific
herbert
fetched
the
atlas
and
the
map
of
the
pacific
was
opened
and
the
engineer
compass
in
hand
prepared
to
determine
their
position
suddenly
the
compasses
stopped
and
he
exclaimed
but
an
island
exists
in
this
part
of
the
pacific
already
an
island
cried
pencroft
tabor
island
an
important
island
no
an
islet
lost
in
the
pacific
and
which
perhaps
has
never
been
visited
well
we
will
visit
it
said
pencroft
we
yes
captain
we
will
build
a
decked
boat
and
i
will
undertake
to
steer
her
at
what
distance
are
we
from
this
tabor
island
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
the
northeast
replied
harding
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
and
whats
that
returned
pencroft
in
fortyeight
hours
with
a
good
wind
we
should
sight
it
and
on
this
reply
it
was
decided
that
a
vessel
should
be
constructed
in
time
to
be
launched
towards
the
month
of
next
october
on
the
return
of
the
fine
season
chapter
10
when
pencroft
had
once
got
a
plan
in
his
head
he
had
no
peace
till
it
was
executed
now
he
wished
to
visit
tabor
island
and
as
a
boat
of
a
certain
size
was
necessary
for
this
voyage
he
determined
to
build
one
what
wood
should
he
employ
elm
or
fir
both
of
which
abounded
in
the
island
they
decided
for
the
fir
as
being
easy
to
work
but
which
stands
water
as
well
as
the
elm
these
details
settled
it
was
agreed
that
since
the
fine
season
would
not
return
before
six
months
cyrus
harding
and
pencroft
should
work
alone
at
the
boat
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
were
to
continue
to
hunt
and
neither
neb
nor
master
jup
his
assistant
were
to
leave
the
domestic
duties
which
had
devolved
upon
them
directly
the
trees
were
chosen
they
were
felled
stripped
of
their
branches
and
sawn
into
planks
as
well
as
sawyers
would
have
been
able
to
do
it
a
week
after
in
the
recess
between
the
chimneys
and
the
cliff
a
dockyard
was
prepared
and
a
keel
fiveandthirty
feet
long
furnished
with
a
sternpost
at
the
stern
and
a
stem
at
the
bows
lay
along
the
sand
cyrus
harding
was
not
working
in
the
dark
at
this
new
trade
he
knew
as
much
about
shipbuilding
as
about
nearly
everything
else
and
he
had
at
first
drawn
the
model
of
his
ship
on
paper
besides
he
was
ably
seconded
by
pencroft
who
having
worked
for
several
years
in
a
dockyard
in
brooklyn
knew
the
practical
part
of
the
trade
it
was
not
until
after
careful
calculation
and
deep
thought
that
the
timbers
were
laid
on
the
keel
pencroft
as
may
be
believed
was
all
eagerness
to
carry
out
his
new
enterprise
and
would
not
leave
his
work
for
an
instant
a
single
thing
had
the
honor
of
drawing
him
but
for
one
day
only
from
his
dockyard
this
was
the
second
wheatharvest
which
was
gathered
in
on
the
15th
of
april
it
was
as
much
a
success
as
the
first
and
yielded
the
number
of
grains
which
had
been
predicted
five
bushels
captain
said
pencroft
after
having
scrupulously
measured
his
treasure
five
bushels
replied
the
engineer
and
a
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
grains
a
bushel
will
make
six
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
grains
well
we
will
sow
them
all
this
time
said
the
sailor
except
a
little
in
reserve
yes
pencroft
and
if
the
next
crop
gives
a
proportionate
yield
we
shall
have
four
thousand
bushels
and
shall
we
eat
bread
we
shall
eat
bread
but
we
must
have
a
mill
we
will
make
one
the
third
cornfield
was
very
much
larger
than
the
two
first
and
the
soil
prepared
with
extreme
care
received
the
precious
seed
that
done
pencroft
returned
to
his
work
during
this
time
spilett
and
herbert
hunted
in
the
neighborhood
and
they
ventured
deep
into
the
still
unknown
parts
of
the
far
west
their
guns
loaded
with
ball
ready
for
any
dangerous
emergency
it
was
a
vast
thicket
of
magnificent
trees
crowded
together
as
if
pressed
for
room
the
exploration
of
these
dense
masses
of
wood
was
difficult
in
the
extreme
and
the
reporter
never
ventured
there
without
the
pocketcompass
for
the
sun
scarcely
pierced
through
the
thick
foliage
and
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
for
them
to
retrace
their
way
it
naturally
happened
that
game
was
more
rare
in
those
situations
where
there
was
hardly
sufficient
room
to
move
two
or
three
large
herbivorous
animals
were
however
killed
during
the
last
fortnight
of
april
these
were
koalas
specimens
of
which
the
settlers
had
already
seen
to
the
north
of
the
lake
and
which
stupidly
allowed
themselves
to
be
killed
among
the
thick
branches
of
the
trees
in
which
they
took
refuge
their
skins
were
brought
back
to
granite
house
and
there
by
the
help
of
sulphuric
acid
they
were
subjected
to
a
sort
of
tanning
process
which
rendered
them
capable
of
being
used
on
the
30th
of
april
the
two
sportsmen
were
in
the
depth
of
the
far
west
when
the
reporter
preceding
herbert
a
few
paces
arrived
in
a
sort
of
clearing
into
which
the
trees
more
sparsely
scattered
had
permitted
a
few
rays
to
penetrate
gideon
spilett
was
at
first
surprised
at
the
odor
which
exhaled
from
certain
plants
with
straight
stalks
round
and
branchy
bearing
grapelike
clusters
of
flowers
and
very
small
berries
the
reporter
broke
off
one
or
two
of
these
stalks
and
returned
to
the
lad
to
whom
he
said
what
can
this
be
herbert
well
mr
spilett
said
herbert
this
is
a
treasure
which
will
secure
you
pencrofts
gratitude
forever
is
it
tobacco
yes
and
though
it
may
not
be
of
the
first
quality
it
is
none
the
less
tobacco
oh
good
old
pencroft
wont
he
be
pleased
but
we
must
not
let
him
smoke
it
all
he
must
give
us
our
share
ah
an
idea
occurs
to
me
mr
spilett
replied
herbert
dont
let
us
say
anything
to
pencroft
yet
we
will
prepare
these
leaves
and
one
fine
day
we
will
present
him
with
a
pipe
already
filled
all
right
herbert
and
on
that
day
our
worthy
companion
will
have
nothing
left
to
wish
for
in
this
world
the
reporter
and
the
lad
secured
a
good
store
of
the
precious
plant
and
then
returned
to
granite
house
where
they
smuggled
it
in
with
as
much
precaution
as
if
pencroft
had
been
the
most
vigilant
and
severe
of
customhouse
officers
cyrus
harding
and
neb
were
taken
into
confidence
and
the
sailor
suspected
nothing
during
the
whole
time
necessarily
somewhat
long
which
was
required
in
order
to
dry
the
small
leaves
chop
them
up
and
subject
them
to
a
certain
torrefaction
on
hot
stones
this
took
two
months
but
all
these
manipulations
were
successfully
carried
on
unknown
to
pencroft
for
occupied
with
the
construction
of
his
boat
he
only
returned
to
granite
house
at
the
hour
of
rest
for
some
days
they
had
observed
an
enormous
animal
two
or
three
miles
out
in
the
open
sea
swimming
around
lincoln
island
this
was
a
whale
of
the
largest
size
which
apparently
belonged
to
the
southern
species
called
the
cape
whale
what
a
lucky
chance
it
would
be
if
we
could
capture
it
cried
the
sailor
ah
if
we
only
had
a
proper
boat
and
a
good
harpoon
i
would
say
after
the
beast
for
he
would
be
well
worth
the
trouble
of
catching
well
pencroft
observed
harding
i
should
much
like
to
watch
you
handling
a
harpoon
it
would
be
very
interesting
i
am
astonished
said
the
reporter
to
see
a
whale
in
this
comparatively
high
latitude
why
so
mr
spilett
replied
herbert
we
are
exactly
in
that
part
of
the
pacific
which
english
and
american
whalemen
call
the
whale
field
and
it
is
here
between
new
zealand
and
south
america
that
the
whales
of
the
southern
hemisphere
are
met
with
in
the
greatest
numbers
and
pencroft
returned
to
his
work
not
without
uttering
a
sigh
of
regret
for
every
sailor
is
a
born
fisherman
and
if
the
pleasure
of
fishing
is
in
exact
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
animal
one
can
judge
how
a
whaler
feels
in
sight
of
a
whale
and
if
this
had
only
been
for
pleasure
but
they
could
not
help
feeling
how
valuable
such
a
prize
would
have
been
to
the
colony
for
the
oil
fat
and
bones
would
have
been
put
to
many
uses
now
it
happened
that
this
whale
appeared
to
have
no
wish
to
leave
the
waters
of
the
island
therefore
whether
from
the
windows
of
granite
house
or
from
prospect
heights
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
when
they
were
not
hunting
or
neb
unless
presiding
over
his
fires
never
left
the
telescope
but
watched
all
the
animals
movements
the
cetacean
having
entered
far
into
union
bay
made
rapid
furrows
across
it
from
mandible
cape
to
claw
cape
propelled
by
its
enormously
powerful
flukes
on
which
it
supported
itself
and
making
its
way
through
the
water
at
the
rate
little
short
of
twelve
knots
sometimes
also
it
approached
so
near
to
the
island
that
it
could
be
clearly
distinguished
it
was
the
southern
whale
which
is
completely
black
the
head
being
more
depressed
than
that
of
the
northern
whale
they
could
also
see
it
throwing
up
from
its
airholes
to
a
great
height
a
cloud
of
vapor
or
of
water
for
strange
as
it
may
appear
naturalists
and
whalers
are
not
agreed
on
this
subject
is
it
air
or
is
it
water
which
is
thus
driven
out
it
is
generally
admitted
to
be
vapor
which
condensing
suddenly
by
contact
with
the
cold
air
falls
again
as
rain
however
the
presence
of
this
mammifer
preoccupied
the
colonists
it
irritated
pencroft
especially
as
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
while
at
work
he
ended
by
longing
for
it
like
a
child
for
a
thing
which
it
has
been
denied
at
night
he
talked
about
it
in
his
sleep
and
certainly
if
he
had
had
the
means
of
attacking
it
if
the
sloop
had
been
in
a
fit
state
to
put
to
sea
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
set
out
in
pursuit
but
what
the
colonists
could
not
do
for
themselves
chance
did
for
them
and
on
the
3rd
of
may
shouts
from
neb
who
had
stationed
himself
at
the
kitchen
window
announced
that
the
whale
was
stranded
on
the
beach
of
the
island
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
who
were
just
about
to
set
out
hunting
left
their
guns
pencroft
threw
down
his
ax
and
harding
and
neb
joining
their
companions
all
rushed
towards
the
scene
of
action
the
stranding
had
taken
place
on
the
beach
of
flotsam
point
three
miles
from
granite
house
and
at
high
tide
it
was
therefore
probable
that
the
cetacean
would
not
be
able
to
extricate
itself
easily
at
any
rate
it
was
best
to
hasten
so
as
to
cut
off
its
retreat
if
necessary
they
ran
with
pickaxes
and
irontipped
poles
in
their
hands
passed
over
the
mercy
bridge
descended
the
right
bank
of
the
river
along
the
beach
and
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
the
settlers
were
close
to
the
enormous
animal
above
which
flocks
of
birds
already
hovered
what
a
monster
cried
neb
and
the
exclamation
was
natural
for
it
was
a
southern
whale
eighty
feet
long
a
giant
of
the
species
probably
not
weighing
less
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
in
the
meanwhile
the
monster
thus
stranded
did
not
move
nor
attempt
by
struggling
to
regain
the
water
while
the
tide
was
still
high
it
was
dead
and
a
harpoon
was
sticking
out
of
its
left
side
there
are
whalers
in
these
quarters
then
said
gideon
spilett
directly
oh
mr
spilett
that
doesnt
prove
anything
replied
pencroft
whales
have
been
known
to
go
thousands
of
miles
with
a
harpoon
in
the
side
and
this
one
might
even
have
been
struck
in
the
north
of
the
atlantic
and
come
to
die
in
the
south
of
the
pacific
and
it
would
be
nothing
astonishing
pencroft
having
torn
the
harpoon
from
the
animals
side
read
this
inscription
on
it
maria
stella
vineyard
a
vessel
from
the
vineyard
a
ship
from
my
country
he
cried
the
maria
stella
a
fine
whaler
pon
my
word
i
know
her
well
oh
my
friends
a
vessel
from
the
vineyarda
whaler
from
the
vineyard
and
the
sailor
brandishing
the
harpoon
repeated
not
without
emotion
the
name
which
he
loved
so
wellthe
name
of
his
birthplace
but
as
it
could
not
be
expected
that
the
maria
stella
would
come
to
reclaim
the
animal
harpooned
by
her
they
resolved
to
begin
cutting
it
up
before
decomposition
should
commence
the
birds
who
had
watched
this
rich
prey
for
several
days
had
determined
to
take
possession
of
it
without
further
delay
and
it
was
necessary
to
drive
them
off
by
firing
at
them
repeatedly
the
whale
was
a
female
and
a
large
quantity
of
milk
was
taken
from
it
which
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
naturalist
duffenbach
might
pass
for
cows
milk
and
indeed
it
differs
from
it
neither
in
taste
color
nor
density
pencroft
had
formerly
served
on
board
a
whalingship
and
he
could
methodically
direct
the
operation
of
cutting
up
a
sufficiently
disagreeable
operation
lasting
three
days
but
from
which
the
settlers
did
not
flinch
not
even
gideon
spilett
who
as
the
sailor
said
would
end
by
making
a
real
good
castaway
the
blubber
cut
in
parallel
slices
of
two
feet
and
a
half
in
thickness
then
divided
into
pieces
which
might
weigh
about
a
thousand
pounds
each
was
melted
down
in
large
earthen
pots
brought
to
the
spot
for
they
did
not
wish
to
taint
the
environs
of
granite
house
and
in
this
fusion
it
lost
nearly
a
third
of
its
weight
but
there
was
an
immense
quantity
of
it
the
tongue
alone
yielded
six
thousand
pounds
of
oil
and
the
lower
lip
four
thousand
then
besides
the
fat
which
would
insure
for
a
long
time
a
store
of
stearine
and
glycerine
there
were
still
the
bones
for
which
a
use
could
doubtless
be
found
although
there
were
neither
umbrellas
nor
stays
used
at
granite
house
the
upper
part
of
the
mouth
of
the
cetacean
was
indeed
provided
on
both
sides
with
eight
hundred
horny
blades
very
elastic
of
a
fibrous
texture
and
fringed
at
the
edge
like
great
combs
at
which
the
teeth
six
feet
long
served
to
retain
the
thousands
of
animalculae
little
fish
and
molluscs
on
which
the
whale
fed
the
operation
finished
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
operators
the
remains
of
the
animal
were
left
to
the
birds
who
would
soon
make
every
vestige
of
it
disappear
and
their
usual
daily
occupations
were
resumed
by
the
inmates
of
granite
house
however
before
returning
to
the
dockyard
cyrus
harding
conceived
the
idea
of
fabricating
certain
machines
which
greatly
excited
the
curiosity
of
his
companions
he
took
a
dozen
of
the
whales
bones
cut
them
into
six
equal
parts
and
sharpened
their
ends
this
machine
is
not
my
own
invention
and
it
is
frequently
employed
by
the
aleutian
hunters
in
russian
america
you
see
these
bones
my
friends
well
when
it
freezes
i
will
bend
them
and
then
wet
them
with
water
till
they
are
entirely
covered
with
ice
which
will
keep
them
bent
and
i
will
strew
them
on
the
snow
having
previously
covered
them
with
fat
now
what
will
happen
if
a
hungry
animal
swallows
one
of
these
baits
why
the
heat
of
his
stomach
will
melt
the
ice
and
the
bone
springing
straight
will
pierce
him
with
its
sharp
points
well
i
do
call
that
ingenious
said
pencroft
and
it
will
spare
the
powder
and
shot
rejoined
cyrus
harding
that
will
be
better
than
traps
added
neb
in
the
meanwhile
the
boatbuilding
progressed
and
towards
the
end
of
the
month
half
the
planking
was
completed
it
could
already
be
seen
that
her
shape
was
excellent
and
that
she
would
sail
well
pencroft
worked
with
unparalleled
ardor
and
only
a
sturdy
frame
could
have
borne
such
fatigue
but
his
companions
were
preparing
in
secret
a
reward
for
his
labors
and
on
the
31st
of
may
he
was
to
meet
with
one
of
the
greatest
joys
of
his
life
on
that
day
after
dinner
just
as
he
was
about
to
leave
the
table
pencroft
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
it
was
the
hand
of
gideon
spilett
who
said
one
moment
master
pencroft
you
mustnt
sneak
off
like
that
youve
forgotten
your
dessert
thank
you
mr
spilett
replied
the
sailor
i
am
going
back
to
my
work
well
a
cup
of
coffee
my
friend
nothing
more
a
pipe
then
pencroft
jumped
up
and
his
great
goodnatured
face
grew
pale
when
he
saw
the
reporter
presenting
him
with
a
readyfilled
pipe
and
herbert
with
a
glowing
coal
the
sailor
endeavored
to
speak
but
could
not
get
out
a
word
so
seizing
the
pipe
he
carried
it
to
his
lips
then
applying
the
coal
he
drew
five
or
six
great
whiffs
a
fragrant
blue
cloud
soon
arose
and
from
its
depths
a
voice
was
heard
repeating
excitedly
tobacco
real
tobacco
yes
pencroft
returned
cyrus
harding
and
very
good
tobacco
too
o
divine
providence
sacred
author
of
all
things
cried
the
sailor
nothing
more
is
now
wanting
to
our
island
and
pencroft
smoked
and
smoked
and
smoked
and
who
made
this
discovery
he
asked
at
length
you
herbert
no
doubt
no
pencroft
it
was
mr
spilett
mr
spilett
exclaimed
the
sailor
seizing
the
reporter
and
clasping
him
to
his
breast
with
such
a
squeeze
that
he
had
never
felt
anything
like
it
before
oh
pencroft
said
spilett
recovering
his
breath
at
last
a
truce
for
one
moment
you
must
share
your
gratitude
with
herbert
who
recognized
the
plant
with
cyrus
who
prepared
it
and
with
neb
who
took
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
keep
our
secret
well
my
friends
i
will
repay
you
some
day
replied
the
sailor
now
we
are
friends
for
life
chapter
11
winter
arrived
with
the
month
of
june
which
is
the
december
of
the
northern
zones
and
the
great
business
was
the
making
of
warm
and
solid
clothing
the
musmons
in
the
corral
had
been
stripped
of
their
wool
and
this
precious
textile
material
was
now
to
be
transformed
into
stuff
of
course
cyrus
harding
having
at
his
disposal
neither
carders
combers
polishers
stretchers
twisters
mulejenny
nor
selfacting
machine
to
spin
the
wool
nor
loom
to
weave
it
was
obliged
to
proceed
in
a
simpler
way
so
as
to
do
without
spinning
and
weaving
and
indeed
he
proposed
to
make
use
of
the
property
which
the
filaments
of
wool
possess
when
subjected
to
a
powerful
pressure
of
mixing
together
and
of
manufacturing
by
this
simple
process
the
material
called
felt
this
felt
could
then
be
obtained
by
a
simple
operation
which
if
it
diminished
the
flexibility
of
the
stuff
increased
its
power
of
retaining
heat
in
proportion
now
the
wool
furnished
by
the
musmons
was
composed
of
very
short
hairs
and
was
in
a
good
condition
to
be
felted
the
engineer
aided
by
his
companions
including
pencroft
who
was
once
more
obliged
to
leave
his
boat
commenced
the
preliminary
operations
the
subject
of
which
was
to
rid
the
wool
of
that
fat
and
oily
substance
with
which
it
is
impregnated
and
which
is
called
grease
this
cleaning
was
done
in
vats
filled
with
water
which
was
maintained
at
the
temperature
of
seventy
degrees
and
in
which
the
wool
was
soaked
for
fourandtwenty
hours
it
was
then
thoroughly
washed
in
baths
of
soda
and
when
sufficiently
dried
by
pressure
it
was
in
a
state
to
be
compressed
that
is
to
say
to
produce
a
solid
material
rough
no
doubt
and
such
as
would
have
no
value
in
a
manufacturing
center
of
europe
or
america
but
which
would
be
highly
esteemed
in
the
lincoln
island
markets
this
sort
of
material
must
have
been
known
from
the
most
ancient
times
and
in
fact
the
first
woolen
stuffs
were
manufactured
by
the
process
which
harding
was
now
about
to
employ
where
hardings
engineering
qualifications
now
came
into
play
was
in
the
construction
of
the
machine
for
pressing
the
wool
for
he
knew
how
to
turn
ingeniously
to
profit
the
mechanical
force
hitherto
unused
which
the
waterfall
on
the
beach
possessed
to
move
a
fullingmill
nothing
could
be
more
rudimentary
the
wool
was
placed
in
troughs
and
upon
it
fell
in
turns
heavy
wooden
mallets
such
was
the
machine
in
question
and
such
it
had
been
for
centuries
until
the
time
when
the
mallets
were
replaced
by
cylinders
of
compression
and
the
material
was
no
longer
subjected
to
beating
but
to
regular
rolling
the
operation
ably
directed
by
cyrus
harding
was
a
complete
success
the
wool
previously
impregnated
with
a
solution
of
soap
intended
on
the
one
hand
to
facilitate
the
interlacing
the
compression
and
the
softening
of
the
wool
and
on
the
other
to
prevent
its
diminution
by
the
beating
issued
from
the
mill
in
the
shape
of
thick
felt
cloth
the
roughnesses
with
which
the
staple
of
wool
is
naturally
filled
were
so
thoroughly
entangled
and
interlaced
together
that
a
material
was
formed
equally
suitable
either
for
garments
or
bedclothes
it
was
certainly
neither
merino
muslin
cashmere
rep
satin
alpaca
cloth
nor
flannel
it
was
lincolnian
felt
and
lincoln
island
possessed
yet
another
manufacture
the
colonists
had
now
warm
garments
and
thick
bedclothes
and
they
could
without
fear
await
the
approach
of
the
winter
of
186667
the
severe
cold
began
to
be
felt
about
the
20th
of
june
and
to
his
great
regret
pencroft
was
obliged
to
suspend
his
boatbuilding
which
he
hoped
to
finish
in
time
for
next
spring
the
sailors
great
idea
was
to
make
a
voyage
of
discovery
to
tabor
island
although
harding
could
not
approve
of
a
voyage
simply
for
curiositys
sake
for
there
was
evidently
nothing
to
be
found
on
this
desert
and
almost
arid
rock
a
voyage
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
a
comparatively
small
vessel
over
unknown
seas
could
not
but
cause
him
some
anxiety
suppose
that
their
vessel
once
out
at
sea
should
be
unable
to
reach
tabor
island
and
could
not
return
to
lincoln
island
what
would
become
of
her
in
the
midst
of
the
pacific
so
fruitful
of
disasters
harding
often
talked
over
this
project
with
pencroft
and
he
found
him
strangely
bent
upon
undertaking
this
voyage
for
which
determination
he
himself
could
give
no
sufficient
reason
now
said
the
engineer
one
day
to
him
i
must
observe
my
friend
that
after
having
said
so
much
in
praise
of
lincoln
island
after
having
spoken
so
often
of
the
sorrow
you
would
feel
if
you
were
obliged
to
forsake
it
you
are
the
first
to
wish
to
leave
it
only
to
leave
it
for
a
few
days
replied
pencroft
only
for
a
few
days
captain
time
to
go
and
come
back
and
see
what
that
islet
is
like
but
it
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
lincoln
island
i
know
that
beforehand
then
why
venture
there
to
know
what
is
going
on
in
tabor
island
but
nothing
is
going
on
there
nothing
could
happen
there
who
knows
and
if
you
are
caught
in
a
hurricane
there
is
no
fear
of
that
in
the
fine
season
replied
pencroft
but
captain
as
we
must
provide
against
everything
i
shall
ask
your
permission
to
take
herbert
only
with
me
on
this
voyage
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
placing
his
hand
on
the
sailors
shoulder
if
any
misfortune
happens
to
you
or
to
this
lad
whom
chance
has
made
our
child
do
you
think
we
could
ever
cease
to
blame
ourselves
captain
harding
replied
pencroft
with
unshaken
confidence
we
shall
not
cause
you
that
sorrow
besides
we
will
speak
further
of
this
voyage
when
the
time
comes
to
make
it
and
i
fancy
when
you
have
seen
our
tightrigged
little
craft
when
you
have
observed
how
she
behaves
at
sea
when
we
sail
round
our
island
for
we
will
do
so
togetheri
fancy
i
say
that
you
will
no
longer
hesitate
to
let
me
go
i
dont
conceal
from
you
that
your
boat
will
be
a
masterpiece
say
our
boat
at
least
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
disarmed
for
the
moment
the
conversation
ended
thus
to
be
resumed
later
on
without
convincing
either
the
sailor
or
the
engineer
the
first
snow
fell
towards
the
end
of
the
month
of
june
the
corral
had
previously
been
largely
supplied
with
stores
so
that
daily
visits
to
it
were
not
requisite
but
it
was
decided
that
more
than
a
week
should
never
be
allowed
to
pass
without
someone
going
to
it
traps
were
again
set
and
the
machines
manufactured
by
harding
were
tried
the
bent
whalebones
imprisoned
in
a
case
of
ice
and
covered
with
a
thick
outer
layer
of
fat
were
placed
on
the
border
of
the
forest
at
a
spot
where
animals
usually
passed
on
their
way
to
the
lake
to
the
engineers
great
satisfaction
this
invention
copied
from
the
aleutian
fishermen
succeeded
perfectly
a
dozen
foxes
a
few
wild
boars
and
even
a
jaguar
were
taken
in
this
way
the
animals
being
found
dead
their
stomachs
pierced
by
the
unbent
bones
an
incident
must
here
be
related
not
only
as
interesting
in
itself
but
because
it
was
the
first
attempt
made
by
the
colonists
to
communicate
with
the
rest
of
mankind
gideon
spilett
had
already
several
times
pondered
whether
to
throw
into
the
sea
a
letter
enclosed
in
a
bottle
which
currents
might
perhaps
carry
to
an
inhabited
coast
or
to
confide
it
to
pigeons
but
how
could
it
be
seriously
hoped
that
either
pigeons
or
bottles
could
cross
the
distance
of
twelve
hundred
miles
which
separated
the
island
from
any
inhabited
land
it
would
have
been
pure
folly
but
on
the
30th
of
june
the
capture
was
effected
not
without
difficulty
of
an
albatross
which
a
shot
from
herberts
gun
had
slightly
wounded
in
the
foot
it
was
a
magnificent
bird
measuring
ten
feet
from
wing
to
wing
and
which
could
traverse
seas
as
wide
as
the
pacific
herbert
would
have
liked
to
keep
this
superb
bird
as
its
wound
would
soon
heal
and
he
thought
he
could
tame
it
but
spilett
explained
to
him
that
they
should
not
neglect
this
opportunity
of
attempting
to
communicate
by
this
messenger
with
the
lands
of
the
pacific
for
if
the
albatross
had
come
from
some
inhabited
region
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
it
would
return
there
so
soon
as
it
was
set
free
perhaps
in
his
heart
gideon
spilett
in
whom
the
journalist
sometimes
came
to
the
surface
was
not
sorry
to
have
the
opportunity
of
sending
forth
to
take
its
chance
an
exciting
article
relating
the
adventures
of
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
what
a
success
for
the
authorized
reporter
of
the
new
york
herald
and
for
the
number
which
should
contain
the
article
if
it
should
ever
reach
the
address
of
its
editor
the
honorable
james
bennett
gideon
spilett
then
wrote
out
a
concise
account
which
was
placed
in
a
strong
waterproof
bag
with
an
earnest
request
to
whoever
might
find
it
to
forward
it
to
the
office
of
the
new
york
herald
this
little
bag
was
fastened
to
the
neck
of
the
albatross
and
not
to
its
foot
for
these
birds
are
in
the
habit
of
resting
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
then
liberty
was
given
to
this
swift
courier
of
the
air
and
it
was
not
without
some
emotion
that
the
colonists
watched
it
disappear
in
the
misty
west
where
is
he
going
to
asked
pencroft
towards
new
zealand
replied
herbert
a
good
voyage
to
you
shouted
the
sailor
who
himself
did
not
expect
any
great
result
from
this
mode
of
correspondence
with
the
winter
work
had
been
resumed
in
the
interior
of
granite
house
mending
clothes
and
different
occupations
among
others
making
the
sails
for
their
vessel
which
were
cut
from
the
inexhaustible
ballooncase
during
the
month
of
july
the
cold
was
intense
but
there
was
no
lack
of
either
wood
or
coal
cyrus
harding
had
established
a
second
fireplace
in
the
diningroom
and
there
the
long
winter
evenings
were
spent
talking
while
they
worked
reading
when
the
hands
remained
idle
the
time
passed
with
profit
to
all
it
was
real
enjoyment
to
the
settlers
when
in
their
room
well
lighted
with
candles
well
warmed
with
coal
after
a
good
dinner
elderberry
coffee
smoking
in
the
cups
the
pipes
giving
forth
an
odoriferous
smoke
they
could
hear
the
storm
howling
without
their
comfort
would
have
been
complete
if
complete
comfort
could
ever
exist
for
those
who
are
far
from
their
fellowcreatures
and
without
any
means
of
communication
with
them
they
often
talked
of
their
country
of
the
friends
whom
they
had
left
of
the
grandeur
of
the
american
republic
whose
influence
could
not
but
increase
and
cyrus
harding
who
had
been
much
mixed
up
with
the
affairs
of
the
union
greatly
interested
his
auditors
by
his
recitals
his
views
and
his
prognostics
it
chanced
one
day
that
spilett
was
led
to
say
but
now
my
dear
cyrus
all
this
industrial
and
commercial
movement
to
which
you
predict
a
continual
advance
does
it
not
run
the
danger
of
being
sooner
or
later
completely
stopped
stopped
and
by
what
by
the
want
of
coal
which
may
justly
be
called
the
most
precious
of
minerals
yes
the
most
precious
indeed
replied
the
engineer
and
it
would
seem
that
nature
wished
to
prove
that
it
was
so
by
making
the
diamond
which
is
simply
pure
carbon
crystallized
you
dont
mean
to
say
captain
interrupted
pencroft
that
we
burn
diamonds
in
our
stoves
in
the
shape
of
coal
no
my
friend
replied
harding
however
resumed
gideon
spilett
you
do
not
deny
that
some
day
the
coal
will
be
entirely
consumed
oh
the
veins
of
coal
are
still
considerable
and
the
hundred
thousand
miners
who
annually
extract
from
them
a
hundred
millions
of
hundredweights
have
not
nearly
exhausted
them
with
the
increasing
consumption
of
coal
replied
gideon
spilett
it
can
be
foreseen
that
the
hundred
thousand
workmen
will
soon
become
two
hundred
thousand
and
that
the
rate
of
extraction
will
be
doubled
doubtless
but
after
the
european
mines
which
will
be
soon
worked
more
thoroughly
with
new
machines
the
american
and
australian
mines
will
for
a
long
time
yet
provide
for
the
consumption
in
trade
for
how
long
a
time
asked
the
reporter
for
at
least
two
hundred
and
fifty
or
three
hundred
years
that
is
reassuring
for
us
but
a
bad
lookout
for
our
greatgrandchildren
observed
pencroft
they
will
discover
something
else
said
herbert
it
is
to
be
hoped
so
answered
spilett
for
without
coal
there
would
be
no
machinery
and
without
machinery
there
would
be
no
railways
no
steamers
no
manufactories
nothing
of
that
which
is
indispensable
to
modern
civilization
but
what
will
they
find
asked
pencroft
can
you
guess
captain
nearly
my
friend
and
what
will
they
burn
instead
of
coal
water
replied
harding
water
cried
pencroft
water
as
fuel
for
steamers
and
engines
water
to
heat
water
yes
but
water
decomposed
into
its
primitive
elements
replied
cyrus
harding
and
decomposed
doubtless
by
electricity
which
will
then
have
become
a
powerful
and
manageable
force
for
all
great
discoveries
by
some
inexplicable
laws
appear
to
agree
and
become
complete
at
the
same
time
yes
my
friends
i
believe
that
water
will
one
day
be
employed
as
fuel
that
hydrogen
and
oxygen
which
constitute
it
used
singly
or
together
will
furnish
an
inexhaustible
source
of
heat
and
light
of
an
intensity
of
which
coal
is
not
capable
some
day
the
coalrooms
of
steamers
and
the
tenders
of
locomotives
will
instead
of
coal
be
stored
with
these
two
condensed
gases
which
will
burn
in
the
furnaces
with
enormous
calorific
power
there
is
therefore
nothing
to
fear
as
long
as
the
earth
is
inhabited
it
will
supply
the
wants
of
its
inhabitants
and
there
will
be
no
want
of
either
light
or
heat
as
long
as
the
productions
of
the
vegetable
mineral
or
animal
kingdoms
do
not
fail
us
i
believe
then
that
when
the
deposits
of
coal
are
exhausted
we
shall
heat
and
warm
ourselves
with
water
water
will
be
the
coal
of
the
future
i
should
like
to
see
that
observed
the
sailor
you
were
born
too
soon
pencroft
returned
neb
who
only
took
part
in
the
discussion
by
these
words
however
it
was
not
nebs
speech
which
interrupted
the
conversation
but
tops
barking
which
broke
out
again
with
that
strange
intonation
which
had
before
perplexed
the
engineer
at
the
same
time
top
began
to
run
round
the
mouth
of
the
well
which
opened
at
the
extremity
of
the
interior
passage
what
can
top
be
barking
in
that
way
for
asked
pencroft
and
jup
be
growling
like
that
added
herbert
in
fact
the
orang
joining
the
dog
gave
unequivocal
signs
of
agitation
and
singular
to
say
the
two
animals
appeared
more
uneasy
than
angry
it
is
evident
said
gideon
spilett
that
this
well
is
in
direct
communication
with
the
sea
and
that
some
marine
animal
comes
from
time
to
time
to
breathe
at
the
bottom
thats
evident
replied
the
sailor
and
there
can
be
no
other
explanation
to
give
quiet
there
top
added
pencroft
turning
to
the
dog
and
you
jup
be
off
to
your
room
the
ape
and
the
dog
were
silent
jup
went
off
to
bed
but
top
remained
in
the
room
and
continued
to
utter
low
growls
at
intervals
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
there
was
no
further
talk
on
the
subject
but
the
incident
however
clouded
the
brow
of
the
engineer
during
the
remainder
of
the
month
of
july
there
was
alternate
rain
and
frost
the
temperature
was
not
so
low
as
during
the
preceding
winter
and
its
maximum
did
not
exceed
eight
degrees
fahrenheit
but
although
this
winter
was
less
cold
it
was
more
troubled
by
storms
and
squalls
the
sea
besides
often
endangered
the
safety
of
the
chimneys
at
times
it
almost
seemed
as
if
an
undercurrent
raised
these
monstrous
billows
which
thundered
against
the
wall
of
granite
house
when
the
settlers
leaning
from
their
windows
gazed
on
the
huge
watery
masses
breaking
beneath
their
eyes
they
could
not
but
admire
the
magnificent
spectacle
of
the
ocean
in
its
impotent
fury
the
waves
rebounded
in
dazzling
foam
the
beach
entirely
disapppearing
under
the
raging
flood
and
the
cliff
appearing
to
emerge
from
the
sea
itself
the
spray
rising
to
a
height
of
more
than
a
hundred
feet
during
these
storms
it
was
difficult
and
even
dangerous
to
venture
out
owing
to
the
frequently
falling
trees
however
the
colonists
never
allowed
a
week
to
pass
without
having
paid
a
visit
to
the
corral
happily
this
enclosure
sheltered
by
the
southeastern
spur
of
mount
franklin
did
not
greatly
suffer
from
the
violence
of
the
hurricanes
which
spared
its
trees
sheds
and
palisades
but
the
poultryyard
on
prospect
heights
being
directly
exposed
to
the
gusts
of
wind
from
the
east
suffered
considerable
damage
the
pigeonhouse
was
twice
unroofed
and
the
paling
blown
down
all
this
required
to
be
remade
more
solidly
than
before
for
as
may
be
clearly
seen
lincoln
island
was
situated
in
one
of
the
most
dangerous
parts
of
the
pacific
it
really
appeared
as
if
it
formed
the
central
point
of
vast
cyclones
which
beat
it
perpetually
as
the
whip
does
the
top
only
here
it
was
the
top
which
was
motionless
and
the
whip
which
moved
during
the
first
week
of
the
month
of
august
the
weather
became
more
moderate
and
the
atmosphere
recovered
the
calm
which
it
appeared
to
have
lost
forever
with
the
calm
the
cold
again
became
intense
and
the
thermometer
fell
to
eight
degrees
fahrenheit
below
zero
on
the
3rd
of
august
an
excursion
which
had
been
talked
of
for
several
days
was
made
into
the
southeastern
part
of
the
island
towards
tadorn
marsh
the
hunters
were
tempted
by
the
aquatic
game
which
took
up
their
winter
quarters
there
wild
duck
snipe
teal
and
grebe
abounded
there
and
it
was
agreed
that
a
day
should
be
devoted
to
an
expedition
against
these
birds
not
only
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
but
pencroft
and
neb
also
took
part
in
this
excursion
cyrus
harding
alone
alleging
some
work
as
an
excuse
did
not
join
them
but
remained
at
granite
house
the
hunters
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
port
balloon
in
order
to
reach
the
marsh
after
having
promised
to
be
back
by
the
evening
top
and
jup
accompanied
them
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
over
the
mercy
bridge
the
engineer
raised
it
and
returned
intending
to
put
into
execution
a
project
for
the
performance
of
which
he
wished
to
be
alone
now
this
project
was
to
minutely
explore
the
interior
well
the
mouth
of
which
was
on
a
level
with
the
passage
of
granite
house
and
which
communicated
with
the
sea
since
it
formerly
supplied
a
way
to
the
waters
of
the
lake
why
did
top
so
often
run
round
this
opening
why
did
he
utter
such
strange
barks
when
a
sort
of
uneasiness
seemed
to
draw
him
towards
this
well
why
did
jup
join
top
in
a
sort
of
common
anxiety
had
this
well
branches
besides
the
communication
with
the
sea
did
it
spread
towards
other
parts
of
the
island
this
is
what
cyrus
harding
wished
to
know
he
had
resolved
therefore
to
attempt
the
exploration
of
the
well
during
the
absence
of
his
companions
and
an
opportunity
for
doing
so
had
now
presented
itself
it
was
easy
to
descend
to
the
bottom
of
the
well
by
employing
the
rope
ladder
which
had
not
been
used
since
the
establishment
of
the
lift
the
engineer
drew
the
ladder
to
the
hole
the
diameter
of
which
measured
nearly
six
feet
and
allowed
it
to
unroll
itself
after
having
securely
fastened
its
upper
extremity
then
having
lighted
a
lantern
taken
a
revolver
and
placed
a
cutlass
in
his
belt
he
began
the
descent
the
sides
were
everywhere
entire
but
points
of
rock
jutted
out
here
and
there
and
by
means
of
these
points
it
would
have
been
quite
possible
for
an
active
creature
to
climb
to
the
mouth
of
the
well
the
engineer
remarked
this
but
although
he
carefully
examined
these
points
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
he
could
find
no
impression
no
fracture
which
could
give
any
reason
to
suppose
that
they
had
either
recently
or
at
any
former
time
been
used
as
a
staircase
cyrus
harding
descended
deeper
throwing
the
light
of
his
lantern
on
all
sides
he
saw
nothing
suspicious
when
the
engineer
had
reached
the
last
rounds
he
came
upon
the
water
which
was
then
perfectly
calm
neither
at
its
level
nor
in
any
other
part
of
the
well
did
any
passage
open
which
could
lead
to
the
interior
of
the
cliff
the
wall
which
harding
struck
with
the
hilt
of
his
cutlass
sounded
solid
it
was
compact
granite
through
which
no
living
being
could
force
a
way
to
arrive
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
and
then
climb
up
to
its
mouth
it
was
necessary
to
pass
through
the
channel
under
the
rocky
subsoil
of
the
beach
which
placed
it
in
communication
with
the
sea
and
this
was
only
possible
for
marine
animals
as
to
the
question
of
knowing
where
this
channel
ended
at
what
point
of
the
shore
and
at
what
depth
beneath
the
water
it
could
not
be
answered
then
cyrus
harding
having
ended
his
survey
reascended
drew
up
the
ladder
covered
the
mouth
of
the
well
and
returned
thoughtfully
to
the
diningroom
saying
to
himself
i
have
seen
nothing
and
yet
there
is
something
there
chapter
12
in
the
evening
the
hunters
returned
having
enjoyed
good
sport
and
being
literally
loaded
with
game
indeed
they
had
as
much
as
four
men
could
possibly
carry
top
wore
a
necklace
of
teal
and
jup
wreaths
of
snipe
round
his
body
here
master
cried
neb
heres
something
to
employ
our
time
preserved
and
made
into
pies
we
shall
have
a
welcome
store
but
i
must
have
some
one
to
help
me
i
count
on
you
pencroft
no
neb
replied
the
sailor
i
have
the
rigging
of
the
vessel
to
finish
and
to
look
after
and
you
will
have
to
do
without
me
and
you
mr
herbert
i
must
go
to
the
corral
tomorrow
neb
replied
the
lad
it
will
be
you
then
mr
spilett
who
will
help
me
to
oblige
you
neb
i
will
replied
the
reporter
but
i
warn
you
that
if
you
disclose
your
recipes
to
me
i
shall
publish
them
whenever
you
like
mr
spilett
replied
neb
whenever
you
like
and
so
the
next
day
gideon
spilett
became
nebs
assistant
and
was
installed
in
his
culinary
laboratory
the
engineer
had
previously
made
known
to
him
the
result
of
the
exploration
which
he
had
made
the
day
before
and
on
this
point
the
reporter
shared
hardings
opinion
that
although
he
had
found
nothing
a
secret
still
remained
to
be
discovered
the
frost
continued
for
another
week
and
the
settlers
did
not
leave
granite
house
unless
to
look
after
the
poultryyard
the
dwelling
was
filled
with
appetizing
odors
which
were
emitted
from
the
learned
manipulation
of
neb
and
the
reporter
but
all
the
results
of
the
chase
were
not
made
into
preserved
provisions
and
as
the
game
kept
perfectly
in
the
intense
cold
wild
duck
and
other
fowl
were
eaten
fresh
and
declared
superior
to
all
other
aquatic
birds
in
the
known
world
during
this
week
pencroft
aided
by
herbert
who
handled
the
sailmakers
needle
with
much
skill
worked
with
such
energy
that
the
sails
of
the
vessel
were
finished
there
was
no
want
of
cordage
thanks
to
the
rigging
which
had
been
discovered
with
the
case
of
the
balloon
the
ropes
and
cables
from
the
net
were
all
of
good
quality
and
the
sailor
turned
them
all
to
account
to
the
sails
were
attached
strong
bolt
ropes
and
there
still
remained
enough
from
which
to
make
the
halyards
shrouds
and
sheets
etc
the
blocks
were
manufactured
by
cyrus
harding
under
pencrofts
directions
by
means
of
the
turning
lathe
it
therefore
happened
that
the
rigging
was
entirely
prepared
before
the
vessel
was
finished
pencroft
also
manufactured
a
flag
that
flag
so
dear
to
every
true
american
containing
the
stars
and
stripes
of
their
glorious
union
the
colors
for
it
were
supplied
from
certain
plants
used
in
dyeing
and
which
were
very
abundant
in
the
island
only
to
the
thirtyseven
stars
representing
the
thirtyseven
states
of
the
union
which
shine
on
the
american
flag
the
sailor
added
a
thirtyeighth
the
star
of
the
state
of
lincoln
for
he
considered
his
island
as
already
united
to
the
great
republic
and
said
he
it
is
so
already
in
heart
if
not
in
deed
in
the
meantime
the
flag
was
hoisted
at
the
central
window
of
granite
house
and
the
settlers
saluted
it
with
three
cheers
the
cold
season
was
now
almost
at
an
end
and
it
appeared
as
if
this
second
winter
was
to
pass
without
any
unusual
occurrence
when
on
the
night
of
the
11th
of
august
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
was
menaced
with
complete
destruction
after
a
busy
day
the
colonists
were
sleeping
soundly
when
towards
four
oclock
in
the
morning
they
were
suddenly
awakened
by
tops
barking
the
dog
was
not
this
time
barking
near
the
mouth
of
the
well
but
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
at
which
he
was
scratching
as
if
he
wished
to
burst
it
open
jup
was
also
uttering
piercing
cries
hello
top
cried
neb
who
was
the
first
awake
but
the
dog
continued
to
bark
more
furiously
than
ever
whats
the
matter
now
asked
harding
and
all
dressing
in
haste
rushed
to
the
windows
which
they
opened
beneath
their
eyes
was
spread
a
sheet
of
snow
which
looked
gray
in
the
dim
light
the
settlers
could
see
nothing
but
they
heard
a
singular
yelping
noise
away
in
the
darkness
it
was
evident
that
the
beach
had
been
invaded
by
a
number
of
animals
which
could
not
be
seen
what
are
they
cried
pencroft
wolves
jaguars
or
apes
replied
neb
they
have
nearly
reached
the
plateau
said
the
reporter
and
our
poultryyard
exclaimed
herbert
and
our
garden
where
can
they
have
crossed
asked
pencroft
they
must
have
crossed
the
bridge
on
the
shore
replied
the
engineer
which
one
of
us
must
have
forgotten
to
close
true
said
spilett
i
remember
having
left
it
open
a
fine
job
you
have
made
of
it
mr
spilett
cried
the
sailor
what
is
done
cannot
be
undone
replied
cyrus
harding
we
must
consult
what
it
will
now
be
best
to
do
such
were
the
questions
and
answers
which
were
rapidly
exchanged
between
harding
and
his
companions
it
was
certain
that
the
bridge
had
been
crossed
that
the
shore
had
been
invaded
by
animals
and
that
whatever
they
might
be
they
could
by
ascending
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
reach
prospect
heights
they
must
therefore
be
advanced
against
quickly
and
fought
with
if
necessary
but
what
are
these
beasts
was
asked
a
second
time
as
the
yelpings
were
again
heard
more
loudly
than
before
these
yelps
made
herbert
start
and
he
remembered
having
heard
them
before
during
his
first
visit
to
the
sources
of
the
red
creek
they
are
colpeo
foxes
he
exclaimed
forward
shouted
the
sailor
and
all
arming
themselves
with
hatchets
carbines
and
revolvers
threw
themselves
into
the
lift
and
soon
set
foot
on
the
shore
colpeos
are
dangerous
animals
when
in
great
numbers
and
irritated
by
hunger
nevertheless
the
colonists
did
not
hesitate
to
throw
themselves
into
the
midst
of
the
troop
and
their
first
shots
vividly
lighting
up
the
darkness
made
their
assailants
draw
back
the
chief
thing
was
to
hinder
these
plunderers
from
reaching
the
plateau
for
the
garden
and
the
poultryyard
would
then
have
been
at
their
mercy
and
immense
perhaps
irreparable
mischief
would
inevitably
be
the
result
especially
with
regard
to
the
cornfield
but
as
the
invasion
of
the
plateau
could
only
be
made
by
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
it
was
sufficient
to
oppose
the
colpeos
on
the
narrow
bank
between
the
river
and
the
cliff
of
granite
this
was
plain
to
all
and
by
cyrus
hardings
orders
they
reached
the
spot
indicated
by
him
while
the
colpeos
rushed
fiercely
through
the
gloom
harding
gideon
spilett
herbert
pencroft
and
neb
posted
themselves
in
impregnable
line
top
his
formidable
jaws
open
preceded
the
colonists
and
he
was
followed
by
jup
armed
with
a
knotty
cudgel
which
he
brandished
like
a
club
the
night
was
extremely
dark
it
was
only
by
the
flashes
from
the
revolvers
as
each
person
fired
that
they
could
see
their
assailants
who
were
at
least
a
hundred
in
number
and
whose
eyes
were
glowing
like
hot
coals
they
must
not
pass
shouted
pencroft
they
shall
not
pass
returned
the
engineer
but
if
they
did
not
pass
it
was
not
for
want
of
having
attempted
it
those
in
the
rear
pushed
on
the
foremost
assailants
and
it
was
an
incessant
struggle
with
revolvers
and
hatchets
several
colpeos
already
lay
dead
on
the
ground
but
their
number
did
not
appear
to
diminish
and
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
reinforcements
were
continually
arriving
over
the
bridge
the
colonists
were
soon
obliged
to
fight
at
close
quarters
not
without
receiving
some
wounds
though
happily
very
slight
ones
herbert
had
with
a
shot
from
his
revolver
rescued
neb
on
whose
back
a
colpeo
had
sprung
like
a
tiger
cat
top
fought
with
actual
fury
flying
at
the
throats
of
the
foxes
and
strangling
them
instantaneously
jup
wielded
his
weapon
valiantly
and
it
was
in
vain
that
they
endeavored
to
keep
him
in
the
rear
endowed
doubtless
with
sight
which
enabled
him
to
pierce
the
obscurity
he
was
always
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
uttering
from
time
to
timea
sharp
hissing
sound
which
was
with
him
the
sign
of
great
rejoicing
at
one
moment
he
advanced
so
far
that
by
the
light
from
a
revolver
he
was
seen
surrounded
by
five
or
six
large
colpeos
with
whom
he
was
coping
with
great
coolness
however
the
struggle
was
ended
at
last
and
victory
was
on
the
side
of
the
settlers
but
not
until
they
had
fought
for
two
long
hours
the
first
signs
of
the
approach
of
day
doubtless
determined
the
retreat
of
their
assailants
who
scampered
away
towards
the
north
passing
over
the
bridge
which
neb
ran
immediately
to
raise
when
day
had
sufficiently
lighted
up
the
field
of
battle
the
settlers
counted
as
many
as
fifty
dead
bodies
scattered
about
on
the
shore
and
jup
cried
pencroft
where
is
jup
jup
had
disappeared
his
friend
neb
called
him
and
for
the
first
time
jup
did
not
reply
to
his
friends
call
everyone
set
out
in
search
of
jup
trembling
lest
he
should
be
found
among
the
slain
they
cleared
the
place
of
the
bodies
which
stained
the
snow
with
their
blood
jup
was
found
in
the
midst
of
a
heap
of
colpeos
whose
broken
jaws
and
crushed
bodies
showed
that
they
had
to
do
with
the
terrible
club
of
the
intrepid
animal
poor
jup
still
held
in
his
hand
the
stump
of
his
broken
cudgel
but
deprived
of
his
weapon
he
had
been
overpowered
by
numbers
and
his
chest
was
covered
with
severe
wounds
he
is
living
cried
neb
who
was
bending
over
him
and
we
will
save
him
replied
the
sailor
we
will
nurse
him
as
if
he
was
one
of
ourselves
it
appeared
as
if
jup
understood
for
he
leaned
his
head
on
pencrofts
shoulder
as
if
to
thank
him
the
sailor
was
wounded
himself
but
his
wound
was
insignificant
as
were
those
of
his
companions
for
thanks
to
their
firearms
they
had
been
almost
always
able
to
keep
their
assailants
at
a
distance
it
was
therefore
only
the
orang
whose
condition
was
serious
jup
carried
by
neb
and
pencroft
was
placed
in
the
lift
and
only
a
slight
moan
now
and
then
escaped
his
lips
he
was
gently
drawn
up
to
granite
house
there
he
was
laid
on
a
mattress
taken
from
one
of
the
beds
and
his
wounds
were
bathed
with
the
greatest
care
it
did
not
appear
that
any
vital
part
had
been
reached
but
jup
was
very
weak
from
loss
of
blood
and
a
high
fever
soon
set
in
after
his
wounds
had
been
dressed
he
was
laid
down
strict
diet
was
imposed
just
like
a
real
person
as
neb
said
and
they
made
him
swallow
several
cups
of
a
cooling
drink
for
which
the
ingredients
were
supplied
from
the
vegetable
medicine
chest
of
granite
house
jup
was
at
first
restless
but
his
breathing
gradually
became
more
regular
and
he
was
left
sleeping
quietly
from
time
to
time
top
walking
on
tiptoe
as
one
might
say
came
to
visit
his
friend
and
seemed
to
approve
of
all
the
care
that
had
been
taken
of
him
one
of
jups
hands
hung
over
the
side
of
his
bed
and
top
licked
it
with
a
sympathizing
air
they
employed
the
day
in
interring
the
dead
who
were
dragged
to
the
forest
of
the
far
west
and
there
buried
deep
this
attack
which
might
have
had
such
serious
consequences
was
a
lesson
to
the
settlers
who
from
this
time
never
went
to
bed
until
one
of
their
number
had
made
sure
that
all
the
bridges
were
raised
and
that
no
invasion
was
possible
however
jup
after
having
given
them
serious
anxiety
for
several
days
began
to
recover
his
constitution
brought
him
through
the
fever
gradually
subsided
and
gideon
spilett
who
was
a
bit
of
a
doctor
pronounced
him
quite
out
of
danger
on
the
16th
of
august
jup
began
to
eat
neb
made
him
nice
little
sweet
dishes
which
the
invalid
devoured
with
great
relish
for
if
he
had
a
pet
failing
it
was
that
of
being
somewhat
of
a
gourmand
and
neb
had
never
done
anything
to
cure
him
of
this
fault
what
would
you
have
said
he
to
gideon
spilett
who
sometimes
expostulated
with
him
for
spoiling
the
ape
poor
jup
has
no
other
pleasure
than
that
of
the
palate
and
i
am
only
too
glad
to
be
able
to
reward
his
services
in
this
way
ten
days
after
taking
to
his
bed
on
the
21st
of
august
master
jup
arose
his
wounds
were
healed
and
it
was
evident
that
he
would
not
be
long
in
regaining
his
usual
strength
and
agility
like
all
convalescents
he
was
tremendously
hungry
and
the
reporter
allowed
him
to
eat
as
much
as
he
liked
for
he
trusted
to
that
instinct
which
is
too
often
wanting
in
reasoning
beings
to
keep
the
orang
from
any
excess
neb
was
delighted
to
see
his
pupils
appetite
returning
eat
away
my
jup
said
he
and
dont
spare
anything
you
have
shed
your
blood
for
us
and
it
is
the
least
i
can
do
to
make
you
strong
again
on
the
25th
of
august
nebs
voice
was
heard
calling
to
his
companions
captain
mr
spilett
mr
herbert
pencroft
come
come
the
colonists
who
were
together
in
the
diningroom
rose
at
nebs
call
who
was
then
in
jups
room
whats
the
matter
asked
the
reporter
look
replied
neb
with
a
shout
of
laughter
and
what
did
they
see
master
jup
smoking
calmly
and
seriously
sitting
crosslegged
like
a
turk
at
the
entrance
to
granite
house
my
pipe
cried
pencroft
he
has
taken
my
pipe
hello
my
honest
jup
i
make
you
a
present
of
it
smoke
away
old
boy
smoke
away
and
jup
gravely
puffed
out
clouds
of
smoke
which
seemed
to
give
him
great
satisfaction
harding
did
not
appear
to
be
much
astonished
at
this
incident
and
he
cited
several
examples
of
tame
apes
to
whom
the
use
of
tobacco
had
become
quite
familiar
but
from
this
day
master
jup
had
a
pipe
of
his
own
the
sailors
expipe
which
was
hung
in
his
room
near
his
store
of
tobacco
he
filled
it
himself
lighted
it
with
a
glowing
coal
and
appeared
to
be
the
happiest
of
quadrumana
it
may
readily
be
understood
that
this
similarity
of
tastes
of
jup
and
pencroft
served
to
tighten
the
bonds
of
friendship
which
already
existed
between
the
honest
ape
and
the
worthy
sailor
perhaps
he
is
really
a
man
said
pencroft
sometimes
to
neb
should
you
be
surprised
to
hear
him
beginning
to
speak
to
us
some
day
my
word
no
replied
neb
what
astonishes
me
is
that
he
hasnt
spoken
to
us
before
for
now
he
wants
nothing
but
speech
it
would
amuse
me
all
the
same
resumed
the
sailor
if
some
fine
day
he
said
to
me
suppose
we
change
pipes
pencroft
yes
replied
neb
what
a
pity
he
was
born
dumb
with
the
month
of
september
the
winter
ended
and
the
works
were
again
eagerly
commenced
the
building
of
the
vessel
advanced
rapidly
she
was
already
completely
decked
over
and
all
the
inside
parts
of
the
hull
were
firmly
united
with
ribs
bent
by
means
of
steam
which
answered
all
the
purposes
of
a
mold
as
there
was
no
want
of
wood
pencroft
proposed
to
the
engineer
to
give
a
double
lining
to
the
hull
to
insure
the
strength
of
the
vessel
harding
not
knowing
what
the
future
might
have
in
store
for
them
approved
the
sailors
idea
of
making
the
craft
as
strong
as
possible
the
interior
and
deck
of
the
vessel
was
entirely
finished
towards
the
15th
of
september
for
calking
the
seams
they
made
oakum
of
dry
seaweed
which
was
hammered
in
between
the
planks
then
these
seams
were
covered
with
boiling
tar
which
was
obtained
in
great
abundance
from
the
pines
in
the
forest
the
management
of
the
vessel
was
very
simple
she
had
from
the
first
been
ballasted
with
heavy
blocks
of
granite
walled
up
in
a
bed
of
lime
twelve
thousand
pounds
of
which
they
stowed
away
a
deck
was
placed
over
this
ballast
and
the
interior
was
divided
into
two
cabins
two
benches
extended
along
them
and
served
also
as
lockers
the
foot
of
the
mast
supported
the
partition
which
separated
the
two
cabins
which
were
reached
by
two
hatchways
let
into
the
deck
pencroft
had
no
trouble
in
finding
a
tree
suitable
for
the
mast
he
chose
a
straight
young
fir
with
no
knots
and
which
he
had
only
to
square
at
the
step
and
round
off
at
the
top
the
ironwork
of
the
mast
the
rudder
and
the
hull
had
been
roughly
but
strongly
forged
at
the
chimneys
lastly
yards
masts
boom
spars
oars
etc
were
all
furnished
by
the
first
week
in
october
and
it
was
agreed
that
a
trial
trip
should
be
taken
round
the
island
so
as
to
ascertain
how
the
vessel
would
behave
at
sea
and
how
far
they
might
depend
upon
her
during
all
this
time
the
necessary
works
had
not
been
neglected
the
corral
was
enlarged
for
the
flock
of
musmons
and
goats
had
been
increased
by
a
number
of
young
ones
who
had
to
be
housed
and
fed
the
colonists
had
paid
visits
also
to
the
oyster
bed
the
warren
the
coal
and
iron
mines
and
to
the
till
then
unexplored
districts
of
the
far
west
forest
which
abounded
in
game
certain
indigenous
plants
were
discovered
and
those
fit
for
immediate
use
contributed
to
vary
the
vegetable
stores
of
granite
house
they
were
a
species
of
ficoide
some
similar
to
those
of
the
cape
with
eatable
fleshy
leaves
others
bearing
seeds
containing
a
sort
of
flour
on
the
10th
of
october
the
vessel
was
launched
pencroft
was
radiant
with
joy
the
operation
was
perfectly
successful
the
boat
completely
rigged
having
been
pushed
on
rollers
to
the
waters
edge
was
floated
by
the
rising
tide
amid
the
cheers
of
the
colonists
particularly
of
pencroft
who
showed
no
modesty
on
this
occasion
besides
his
importance
was
to
last
beyond
the
finishing
of
the
vessel
since
after
having
built
her
he
was
to
command
her
the
grade
of
captain
was
bestowed
upon
him
with
the
approbation
of
all
to
satisfy
captain
pencroft
it
was
now
necessary
to
give
a
name
to
the
vessel
and
after
many
propositions
had
been
discussed
the
votes
were
all
in
favor
of
the
bonadventure
as
soon
as
the
bonadventure
had
been
lifted
by
the
rising
tide
it
was
seen
that
she
lay
evenly
in
the
water
and
would
be
easily
navigated
however
the
trial
trip
was
to
be
made
that
very
day
by
an
excursion
off
the
coast
the
weather
was
fine
the
breeze
fresh
and
the
sea
smooth
especially
towards
the
south
coast
for
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
northwest
all
hands
on
board
shouted
pencroft
but
breakfast
was
first
necessary
and
it
was
thought
best
to
take
provisions
on
board
in
the
event
of
their
excursion
being
prolonged
until
the
evening
cyrus
harding
was
equally
anxious
to
try
the
vessel
the
model
of
which
had
originated
with
him
although
on
the
sailors
advice
he
had
altered
some
parts
of
it
but
he
did
not
share
pencrofts
confidence
in
her
and
as
the
latter
had
not
again
spoken
of
the
voyage
to
tabor
island
harding
hoped
he
had
given
it
up
he
would
have
indeed
great
reluctance
in
letting
two
or
three
of
his
companions
venture
so
far
in
so
small
a
boat
which
was
not
of
more
than
fifteen
tons
burden
at
halfpast
ten
everybody
was
on
board
even
top
and
jup
and
herbert
weighed
the
anchor
which
was
fast
in
the
sand
near
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
the
sail
was
hoisted
the
lincolnian
flag
floated
from
the
masthead
and
the
bonadventure
steered
by
pencroft
stood
out
to
sea
the
wind
blowing
out
of
union
bay
she
ran
before
it
and
thus
showed
her
owners
much
to
their
satisfaction
that
she
possessed
a
remarkably
fast
pair
of
heels
according
to
pencrofts
mode
of
speaking
after
having
doubled
flotsam
point
and
claw
cape
the
captain
kept
her
close
hauled
so
as
to
sail
along
the
southern
coast
of
the
island
when
it
was
found
she
sailed
admirably
within
five
points
of
the
wind
all
hands
were
enchanted
they
had
a
good
vessel
which
in
case
of
need
would
be
of
great
service
to
them
and
with
fine
weather
and
a
fresh
breeze
the
voyage
promised
to
be
charming
pencroft
now
stood
off
the
shore
three
or
four
miles
across
from
port
balloon
the
island
then
appeared
in
all
its
extent
and
under
a
new
aspect
with
the
varied
panorama
of
its
shore
from
claw
cape
to
reptile
end
the
forests
in
which
dark
firs
contrasted
with
the
young
foliage
of
other
trees
and
overlooked
the
whole
and
mount
franklin
whose
lofty
head
was
still
whitened
with
snow
how
beautiful
it
is
cried
herbert
yes
our
island
is
beautiful
and
good
replied
pencroft
i
love
it
as
i
loved
my
poor
mother
it
received
us
poor
and
destitute
and
now
what
is
wanting
to
us
five
fellows
who
fell
on
it
from
the
sky
nothing
replied
neb
nothing
captain
and
the
two
brave
men
gave
three
tremendous
cheers
in
honor
of
their
island
during
all
this
time
gideon
spilett
leaning
against
the
mast
sketched
the
panorama
which
was
developed
before
his
eyes
cyrus
harding
gazed
on
it
in
silence
well
captain
harding
asked
pencroft
what
do
you
think
of
our
vessel
she
appears
to
behave
well
replied
the
engineer
good
and
do
you
think
now
that
she
could
undertake
a
voyage
of
some
extent
what
voyage
pencroft
one
to
tabor
island
for
instance
my
friend
replied
harding
i
think
that
in
any
pressing
emergency
we
need
not
hesitate
to
trust
ourselves
to
the
bonadventure
even
for
a
longer
voyage
but
you
know
i
should
see
you
set
off
to
tabor
island
with
great
uneasiness
since
nothing
obliges
you
to
go
there
one
likes
to
know
ones
neighbors
returned
the
sailor
who
was
obstinate
in
his
idea
tabor
island
is
our
neighbor
and
the
only
one
politeness
requires
us
to
go
at
least
to
pay
a
visit
by
jove
said
spilett
our
friend
pencroft
has
become
very
particular
about
the
proprieties
all
at
once
i
am
not
particular
about
anything
at
all
retorted
the
sailor
who
was
rather
vexed
by
the
engineers
opposition
but
who
did
not
wish
to
cause
him
anxiety
consider
pencroft
resumed
harding
you
cannot
go
alone
to
tabor
island
one
companion
will
be
enough
for
me
even
so
replied
the
engineer
you
will
risk
depriving
the
colony
of
lincoln
island
of
two
settlers
out
of
five
out
of
six
answered
pencroft
you
forget
jup
out
of
seven
added
neb
top
is
quite
worth
another
there
is
no
risk
at
all
in
it
captain
replied
pencroft
that
is
possible
pencroft
but
i
repeat
it
is
to
expose
ourselves
uselessly
the
obstinate
sailor
did
not
reply
and
let
the
conversation
drop
quite
determined
to
resume
it
again
but
he
did
not
suspect
that
an
incident
would
come
to
his
aid
and
change
into
an
act
of
humanity
that
which
was
at
first
only
a
doubtful
whim
after
standing
off
the
shore
the
bonadventure
again
approached
it
in
the
direction
of
port
balloon
it
was
important
to
ascertain
the
channels
between
the
sandbanks
and
reefs
that
buoys
might
be
laid
down
since
this
little
creek
was
to
be
the
harbor
they
were
not
more
than
half
a
mile
from
the
coast
and
it
was
necessary
to
tack
to
beat
against
the
wind
the
bonadventure
was
then
going
at
a
very
moderate
rate
as
the
breeze
partly
intercepted
by
the
high
land
scarcely
swelled
her
sails
and
the
sea
smooth
as
glass
was
only
rippled
now
and
then
by
passing
gusts
herbert
had
stationed
himself
in
the
bows
that
he
might
indicate
the
course
to
be
followed
among
the
channels
when
all
at
once
he
shouted
luff
pencroft
luff
whats
the
matter
replied
the
sailor
a
rock
nowait
said
herbert
i
dont
quite
see
luff
againrightnow
so
saying
herbert
leaning
over
the
side
plunged
his
arm
into
the
water
and
pulled
it
out
exclaiming
a
bottle
he
held
in
his
hand
a
corked
bottle
which
he
had
just
seized
a
few
cables
length
from
the
shore
cyrus
harding
took
the
bottle
without
uttering
a
single
word
he
drew
the
cork
and
took
from
it
a
damp
paper
on
which
were
written
these
words
castaway

a
castaway
exclaimed
pencroft
left
on
this
tabor
island
not
two
hundred
miles
from
us
ah
captain
harding
you
wont
now
oppose
my
going
no
pencroft
replied
cyrus
harding
and
you
shall
set
out
as
soon
as
possible
tomorrow
tomorrow
the
engineer
still
held
in
his
hand
the
paper
which
he
had
taken
from
the
bottle
he
contemplated
it
for
some
instants
then
resumed
from
this
document
my
friends
from
the
way
in
which
it
is
worded
we
may
conclude
this
first
that
the
castaway
on
tabor
island
is
a
man
possessing
a
considerable
knowledge
of
navigation
since
he
gives
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
the
island
exactly
as
we
ourselves
found
it
and
to
a
second
of
approximation
secondly
that
he
is
either
english
or
american
as
the
document
is
written
in
the
english
language
that
is
perfectly
logical
answered
spilett
and
the
presence
of
this
castaway
explains
the
arrival
of
the
case
on
the
shores
of
our
island
there
must
have
been
a
wreck
since
there
is
a
castaway
as
to
the
latter
whoever
he
may
be
it
is
lucky
for
him
that
pencroft
thought
of
building
this
boat
and
of
trying
her
this
very
day
for
a
day
later
and
this
bottle
might
have
been
broken
on
the
rocks
indeed
said
herbert
it
is
a
fortunate
chance
that
the
bonadventure
passed
exactly
where
the
bottle
was
still
floating
does
not
this
appear
strange
to
you
asked
harding
of
pencroft
it
appears
fortunate
thats
all
answered
the
sailor
do
you
see
anything
extraordinary
in
it
captain
the
bottle
must
go
somewhere
and
why
not
here
as
well
as
anywhere
else
perhaps
you
are
right
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
and
yet
but
observed
herbert
theres
nothing
to
prove
that
this
bottle
has
been
floating
long
in
the
sea
nothing
replied
gideon
spilett
and
the
document
appears
even
to
have
been
recently
written
what
do
you
think
about
it
cyrus
during
this
conversation
pencroft
had
not
remained
inactive
he
had
put
the
vessel
about
and
the
bonadventure
all
sails
set
was
running
rapidly
towards
claw
cape
every
one
was
thinking
of
the
castaway
on
tabor
island
should
they
be
in
time
to
save
him
this
was
a
great
event
in
the
life
of
the
colonists
they
themselves
were
but
castaways
but
it
was
to
be
feared
that
another
might
not
have
been
so
fortunate
and
their
duty
was
to
go
to
his
succor
claw
cape
was
doubled
and
about
four
oclock
the
bonadventure
dropped
her
anchor
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
that
same
evening
the
arrangements
for
the
new
expedition
were
made
it
appeared
best
that
pencroft
and
herbert
who
knew
how
to
work
the
vessel
should
undertake
the
voyage
alone
by
setting
out
the
next
day
the
10th
of
october
they
would
arrive
on
the
13th
for
with
the
present
wind
it
would
not
take
more
than
fortyeight
hours
to
make
this
passage
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
one
day
in
the
island
three
or
four
to
return
they
might
hope
therefore
that
on
the
17th
they
would
again
reach
lincoln
island
the
weather
was
fine
the
barometer
was
rising
the
wind
appeared
settled
everything
then
was
in
favor
of
these
brave
men
whom
an
act
of
humanity
was
taking
far
from
their
island
thus
it
had
been
agreed
that
cyrus
harding
neb
and
gideon
spilett
should
remain
at
granite
house
but
an
objection
was
raised
and
spilett
who
had
not
forgotten
his
business
as
reporter
to
the
new
york
herald
having
declared
that
he
would
go
by
swimming
rather
than
lose
such
an
opportunity
he
was
admitted
to
take
a
part
in
the
voyage
the
evening
was
occupied
in
transporting
on
board
the
bonadventure
articles
of
bedding
utensils
arms
ammunition
a
compass
provisions
for
a
week
this
being
rapidly
done
the
colonists
ascended
to
granite
house
the
next
day
at
five
oclock
in
the
morning
the
farewells
were
said
not
without
some
emotion
on
both
sides
and
pencroft
setting
sail
made
towards
claw
cape
which
had
to
be
doubled
in
order
to
proceed
to
the
southwest
the
bonadventure
was
already
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
coast
when
the
passengers
perceived
on
the
heights
of
granite
house
two
men
waving
their
farewells
they
were
cyrus
harding
and
neb
our
friends
exclaimed
spilett
this
is
our
first
separation
in
fifteen
months
pencroft
the
reporter
and
herbert
waved
in
return
and
granite
house
soon
disappeared
behind
the
high
rocks
of
the
cape
during
the
first
part
of
the
day
the
bonadventure
was
still
in
sight
of
the
southern
coast
of
lincoln
island
which
soon
appeared
just
like
a
green
basket
with
mount
franklin
rising
from
the
center
the
heights
diminished
by
distance
did
not
present
an
appearance
likely
to
tempt
vessels
to
touch
there
reptile
end
was
passed
in
about
an
hour
though
at
a
distance
of
about
ten
miles
at
this
distance
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
distinguish
anything
of
the
western
coast
which
stretched
away
to
the
ridges
of
mount
franklin
and
three
hours
after
the
last
of
lincoln
island
sank
below
the
horizon
the
bonadventure
behaved
capitally
bounding
over
the
waves
she
proceeded
rapidly
on
her
course
pencroft
had
hoisted
the
foresail
and
steering
by
the
compass
followed
a
rectilinear
direction
from
time
to
time
herbert
relieved
him
at
the
helm
and
the
lads
hand
was
so
firm
that
the
sailor
had
not
a
point
to
find
fault
with
gideon
spilett
chatted
sometimes
with
one
sometimes
with
the
other
if
wanted
he
lent
a
hand
with
the
ropes
and
captain
pencroft
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
crew
in
the
evening
the
crescent
moon
which
would
not
be
in
its
first
quarter
until
the
16th
appeared
in
the
twilight
and
soon
set
again
the
night
was
dark
but
starry
and
the
next
day
again
promised
to
be
fine
pencroft
prudently
lowered
the
foresail
not
wishing
to
be
caught
by
a
sudden
gust
while
carrying
too
much
canvas
it
was
perhaps
an
unnecessary
precaution
on
such
a
calm
night
but
pencroft
was
a
prudent
sailor
and
cannot
be
blamed
for
it
the
reporter
slept
part
of
the
night
pencroft
and
herbert
took
turns
for
a
spell
of
two
hours
each
at
the
helm
the
sailor
trusted
herbert
as
he
would
himself
and
his
confidence
was
justified
by
the
coolness
and
judgment
of
the
lad
pencroft
gave
him
his
directions
as
a
commander
to
his
steersman
and
herbert
never
allowed
the
bonadventure
to
swerve
even
a
point
the
night
passed
quickly
as
did
the
day
of
the
12th
of
october
a
southeasterly
direction
was
strictly
maintained
unless
the
bonadventure
fell
in
with
some
unknown
current
she
would
come
exactly
within
sight
of
tabor
island
as
to
the
sea
over
which
the
vessel
was
then
sailing
it
was
absolutely
deserted
now
and
then
a
great
albatross
or
frigate
bird
passed
within
gunshot
and
gideon
spilett
wondered
if
it
was
to
one
of
them
that
he
had
confided
his
last
letter
addressed
to
the
new
york
herald
these
birds
were
the
only
beings
that
appeared
to
frequent
this
part
of
the
ocean
between
tabor
and
lincoln
islands
and
yet
observed
herbert
this
is
the
time
that
whalers
usually
proceed
towards
the
southern
part
of
the
pacific
indeed
i
do
not
think
there
could
be
a
more
deserted
sea
than
this
it
is
not
quite
so
deserted
as
all
that
replied
pencroft
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
reporter
we
are
on
it
do
you
take
our
vessel
for
a
wreck
and
us
for
porpoises
and
pencroft
laughed
at
his
joke
by
the
evening
according
to
calculation
it
was
thought
that
the
bonadventure
had
accomplished
a
distance
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
since
her
departure
from
lincoln
island
that
is
to
say
in
thirtysix
hours
which
would
give
her
a
speed
of
between
three
and
four
knots
the
breeze
was
very
slight
and
might
soon
drop
altogether
however
it
was
hoped
that
the
next
morning
by
break
of
day
if
the
calculation
had
been
correct
and
the
course
true
they
would
sight
tabor
island
neither
gideon
spilett
herbert
nor
pencroft
slept
that
night
in
the
expectation
of
the
next
day
they
could
not
but
feel
some
emotion
there
was
so
much
uncertainty
in
their
enterprise
were
they
near
tabor
island
was
the
island
still
inhabited
by
the
castaway
to
whose
succor
they
had
come
who
was
this
man
would
not
his
presence
disturb
the
little
colony
till
then
so
united
besides
would
he
be
content
to
exchange
his
prison
for
another
all
these
questions
which
would
no
doubt
be
answered
the
next
day
kept
them
in
suspense
and
at
the
dawn
of
day
they
all
fixed
their
gaze
on
the
western
horizon
land
shouted
pencroft
at
about
six
oclock
in
the
morning
and
it
was
impossible
that
pencroft
should
be
mistaken
it
was
evident
that
land
was
there
imagine
the
joy
of
the
little
crew
of
the
bonadventure
in
a
few
hours
they
would
land
on
the
beach
of
the
island
the
low
coast
of
tabor
island
scarcely
emerging
from
the
sea
was
not
more
than
fifteen
miles
distant
the
head
of
the
bonadventure
which
was
a
little
to
the
south
of
the
island
was
set
directly
towards
it
and
as
the
sun
mounted
in
the
east
its
rays
fell
upon
one
or
two
headlands
this
is
a
much
less
important
isle
than
lincoln
island
observed
herbert
and
is
probably
due
like
ours
to
some
submarine
convulsion
at
eleven
oclock
the
bonadventure
was
not
more
than
two
miles
off
and
pencroft
while
looking
for
a
suitable
place
at
which
to
land
proceeded
very
cautiously
through
the
unknown
waters
the
whole
of
the
island
could
now
be
surveyed
and
on
it
could
be
seen
groups
of
gum
and
other
large
trees
of
the
same
species
as
those
growing
on
lincoln
island
but
the
astonishing
thing
was
that
no
smoke
arose
to
show
that
the
island
was
inhabited
no
signal
whatever
appeared
on
the
shore
and
yet
the
document
was
clear
enough
there
was
a
castaway
and
this
castaway
should
have
been
on
the
watch
in
the
meanwhile
the
bonadventure
entered
the
winding
channels
among
the
reefs
and
pencroft
observed
every
turn
with
extreme
care
he
had
put
herbert
at
the
helm
posting
himself
in
the
bows
inspecting
the
water
while
he
held
the
halliard
in
his
hand
ready
to
lower
the
sail
at
a
moments
notice
gideon
spilett
with
his
glass
eagerly
scanned
the
shore
though
without
perceiving
anything
however
at
about
twelve
oclock
the
keel
of
the
bonadventure
grated
on
the
bottom
the
anchor
was
let
go
the
sails
furled
and
the
crew
of
the
little
vessel
landed
and
there
was
no
reason
to
doubt
that
this
was
tabor
island
since
according
to
the
most
recent
charts
there
was
no
island
in
this
part
of
the
pacific
between
new
zealand
and
the
american
coast
the
vessel
was
securely
moored
so
that
there
should
be
no
danger
of
her
being
carried
away
by
the
receding
tide
then
pencroft
and
his
companions
well
armed
ascended
the
shore
so
as
to
gain
an
elevation
of
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
or
three
hundred
feet
which
rose
at
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
from
the
summit
of
that
hill
said
spilett
we
can
no
doubt
obtain
a
complete
view
of
the
island
which
will
greatly
facilitate
our
search
so
as
to
do
here
replied
herbert
that
which
captain
harding
did
the
very
first
thing
on
lincoln
island
by
climbing
mount
franklin
exactly
so
answered
the
reporter
and
it
is
the
best
plan
while
thus
talking
the
explorers
had
advanced
along
a
clearing
which
terminated
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
flocks
of
rockpigeons
and
seaswallows
similar
to
those
of
lincoln
island
fluttered
around
them
under
the
woods
which
skirted
the
glade
on
the
left
they
could
hear
the
bushes
rustling
and
see
the
grass
waving
which
indicated
the
presence
of
timid
animals
but
still
nothing
to
show
that
the
island
was
inhabited
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
pencroft
spilett
and
herbert
climbed
it
in
a
few
minutes
and
gazed
anxiously
round
the
horizon
they
were
on
an
islet
which
did
not
measure
more
than
six
miles
in
circumference
its
shape
not
much
bordered
by
capes
or
promontories
bays
or
creeks
being
a
lengthened
oval
all
around
the
lonely
sea
extended
to
the
limits
of
the
horizon
no
land
nor
even
a
sail
was
in
sight
this
woody
islet
did
not
offer
the
varied
aspects
of
lincoln
island
arid
and
wild
in
one
part
but
fertile
and
rich
in
the
other
on
the
contrary
this
was
a
uniform
mass
of
verdure
out
of
which
rose
two
or
three
hills
of
no
great
height
obliquely
to
the
oval
of
the
island
ran
a
stream
through
a
wide
meadow
falling
into
the
sea
on
the
west
by
a
narrow
mouth
the
domain
is
limited
said
herbert
yes
rejoined
pencroft
it
would
have
been
too
small
for
us
and
moreover
said
the
reporter
it
appears
to
be
uninhabited
indeed
answered
herbert
nothing
here
betrays
the
presence
of
man
let
us
go
down
said
pencroft
and
search
the
sailor
and
his
two
companions
returned
to
the
shore
to
the
place
where
they
had
left
the
bonadventure
they
had
decided
to
make
the
tour
of
the
island
on
foot
before
exploring
the
interior
so
that
not
a
spot
should
escape
their
investigations
the
beach
was
easy
to
follow
and
only
in
some
places
was
their
way
barred
by
large
rocks
which
however
they
easily
passed
round
the
explorers
proceeded
towards
the
south
disturbing
numerous
flocks
of
seabirds
and
herds
of
seals
which
threw
themselves
into
the
sea
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
strangers
at
a
distance
those
beasts
yonder
observed
the
reporter
do
not
see
men
for
the
first
time
they
fear
them
therefore
they
must
know
them
an
hour
after
their
departure
they
arrived
on
the
southern
point
of
the
islet
terminated
by
a
sharp
cape
and
proceeded
towards
the
north
along
the
western
coast
equally
formed
by
sand
and
rocks
the
background
bordered
with
thick
woods
there
was
not
a
trace
of
a
habitation
in
any
part
not
the
print
of
a
human
foot
on
the
shore
of
the
island
which
after
four
hours
walking
had
been
gone
completely
round
it
was
to
say
the
least
very
extraordinary
and
they
were
compelled
to
believe
that
tabor
island
was
not
or
was
no
longer
inhabited
perhaps
after
all
the
document
was
already
several
months
or
several
years
old
and
it
was
possible
in
this
case
either
that
the
castaway
had
been
enabled
to
return
to
his
country
or
that
he
had
died
of
misery
pencroft
spilett
and
herbert
forming
more
or
less
probable
conjectures
dined
rapidly
on
board
the
bonadventure
so
as
to
be
able
to
continue
their
excursion
until
nightfall
this
was
done
at
five
oclock
in
the
evening
at
which
hour
they
entered
the
wood
numerous
animals
fled
at
their
approach
being
principally
one
might
say
only
goats
and
pigs
which
were
obviously
european
species
doubtless
some
whaler
had
landed
them
on
the
island
where
they
had
rapidly
increased
herbert
resolved
to
catch
one
or
two
living
and
take
them
back
to
lincoln
island
it
was
no
longer
doubtful
that
men
at
some
period
or
other
had
visited
this
islet
and
this
became
still
more
evident
when
paths
appeared
trodden
through
the
forest
felled
trees
and
everywhere
traces
of
the
hand
of
man
but
the
trees
were
becoming
rotten
and
had
been
felled
many
years
ago
the
marks
of
the
axe
were
velveted
with
moss
and
the
grass
grew
long
and
thick
on
the
paths
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
find
them
but
observed
gideon
spilett
this
not
only
proves
that
men
have
landed
on
the
island
but
also
that
they
lived
on
it
for
some
time
now
who
were
these
men
how
many
of
them
remain
the
document
said
herbert
only
spoke
of
one
castaway
well
if
he
is
still
on
the
island
replied
pencroft
it
is
impossible
but
that
we
shall
find
him
the
exploration
was
continued
the
sailor
and
his
companions
naturally
followed
the
route
which
cut
diagonally
across
the
island
and
they
were
thus
obliged
to
follow
the
stream
which
flowed
towards
the
sea
if
the
animals
of
european
origin
if
works
due
to
a
human
hand
showed
incontestably
that
men
had
already
visited
the
island
several
specimens
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
did
not
prove
it
less
in
some
places
in
the
midst
of
clearings
it
was
evident
that
the
soil
had
been
planted
with
culinary
plants
at
probably
the
same
distant
period
what
then
was
herberts
joy
when
he
recognized
potatoes
chicory
sorrel
carrots
cabbages
and
turnips
of
which
it
was
sufficient
to
collect
the
seed
to
enrich
the
soil
of
lincoln
island
capital
jolly
exclaimed
pencroft
that
will
suit
neb
as
well
as
us
even
if
we
do
not
find
the
castaway
at
least
our
voyage
will
not
have
been
useless
and
god
will
have
rewarded
us
doubtless
replied
gideon
spilett
but
to
see
the
state
in
which
we
find
these
plantations
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
island
has
not
been
inhabited
for
some
time
indeed
answered
herbert
an
inhabitant
whoever
he
was
could
not
have
neglected
such
an
important
culture
yes
said
pencroft
the
castaway
has
gone
we
must
suppose
so
it
must
then
be
admitted
that
the
document
has
already
a
distant
date
evidently
and
that
the
bottle
only
arrived
at
lincoln
island
after
having
floated
in
the
sea
a
long
time
why
not
returned
pencroft
but
night
is
coming
on
added
he
and
i
think
that
it
will
be
best
to
give
up
the
search
for
the
present
let
us
go
on
board
and
tomorrow
we
will
begin
again
said
the
reporter
this
was
the
wisest
course
and
it
was
about
to
be
followed
when
herbert
pointing
to
a
confused
mass
among
the
trees
exclaimed
a
hut
all
three
immediately
ran
towards
the
dwelling
in
the
twilight
it
was
just
possible
to
see
that
it
was
built
of
planks
and
covered
with
a
thick
tarpaulin
the
halfclosed
door
was
pushed
open
by
pencroft
who
entered
with
a
rapid
step
the
hut
was
empty
chapter
14
pencroft
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
remained
silent
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
pencroft
shouted
loudly
no
reply
was
made
the
sailor
then
struck
a
light
and
set
fire
to
a
twig
this
lighted
for
a
minute
a
small
room
which
appeared
perfectly
empty
at
the
back
was
a
rude
fireplace
with
a
few
cold
cinders
supporting
an
armful
of
dry
wood
pencroft
threw
the
blazing
twig
on
it
the
wood
crackled
and
gave
forth
a
bright
light
the
sailor
and
his
two
companions
then
perceived
a
disordered
bed
of
which
the
damp
and
yellow
coverlets
proved
that
it
had
not
been
used
for
a
long
time
in
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
were
two
kettles
covered
with
rust
and
an
overthrown
pot
a
cupboard
with
a
few
moldy
sailors
clothes
on
the
table
a
tin
plate
and
a
bible
eaten
away
by
damp
in
a
corner
a
few
tools
a
spade
pickaxe
two
fowlingpieces
one
of
which
was
broken
on
a
plank
forming
a
shelf
stood
a
barrel
of
powder
still
untouched
a
barrel
of
shot
and
several
boxes
of
caps
all
thickly
covered
with
dust
accumulated
perhaps
by
many
long
years
there
is
no
one
here
said
the
reporter
no
one
replied
pencroft
it
is
a
long
time
since
this
room
has
been
inhabited
observed
herbert
yes
a
very
long
time
answered
the
reporter
mr
spilett
then
said
pencroft
instead
of
returning
on
board
i
think
that
it
would
be
well
to
pass
the
night
in
this
hut
you
are
right
pencroft
answered
gideon
spilett
and
if
its
owner
returns
well
perhaps
he
will
not
be
sorry
to
find
the
place
taken
possession
of
he
will
not
return
said
the
sailor
shaking
his
head
you
think
that
he
has
quitted
the
island
asked
the
reporter
if
he
had
quitted
the
island
he
would
have
taken
away
his
weapons
and
his
tools
replied
pencroft
you
know
the
value
which
castaways
set
on
such
articles
as
these
the
last
remains
of
a
wreck
no
no
repeated
the
sailor
in
a
tone
of
conviction
no
he
has
not
left
the
island
if
he
had
escaped
in
a
boat
made
by
himself
he
would
still
less
have
left
these
indispensable
and
necessary
articles
no
he
is
on
the
island
living
asked
herbert
living
or
dead
but
if
he
is
dead
i
suppose
he
has
not
buried
himself
and
so
we
shall
at
least
find
his
remains
it
was
then
agreed
that
the
night
should
be
passed
in
the
deserted
dwelling
and
a
store
of
wood
found
in
a
corner
was
sufficient
to
warm
it
the
door
closed
pencroft
herbert
and
spilett
remained
there
seated
on
a
bench
talking
little
but
wondering
much
they
were
in
a
frame
of
mind
to
imagine
anything
or
expect
anything
they
listened
eagerly
for
sounds
outside
the
door
might
have
opened
suddenly
and
a
man
presented
himself
to
them
without
their
being
in
the
least
surprised
notwithstanding
all
that
the
hut
revealed
of
abandonment
and
they
had
their
hands
ready
to
press
the
hands
of
this
man
this
castaway
this
unknown
friend
for
whom
friends
were
waiting
but
no
voice
was
heard
the
door
did
not
open
the
hours
thus
passed
away
how
long
the
night
appeared
to
the
sailor
and
his
companions
herbert
alone
slept
for
two
hours
for
at
his
age
sleep
is
a
necessity
they
were
all
three
anxious
to
continue
their
exploration
of
the
day
before
and
to
search
the
most
secret
recesses
of
the
islet
the
inferences
deduced
by
pencroft
were
perfectly
reasonable
and
it
was
nearly
certain
that
as
the
hut
was
deserted
and
the
tools
utensils
and
weapons
were
still
there
the
owner
had
succumbed
it
was
agreed
therefore
that
they
should
search
for
his
remains
and
give
them
at
least
christian
burial
day
dawned
pencroft
and
his
companions
immediately
proceeded
to
survey
the
dwelling
it
had
certainly
been
built
in
a
favorable
situation
at
the
back
of
a
little
hill
sheltered
by
five
or
six
magnificent
gumtrees
before
its
front
and
through
the
trees
the
axe
had
prepared
a
wide
clearing
which
allowed
the
view
to
extend
to
the
sea
beyond
a
lawn
surrounded
by
a
wooden
fence
falling
to
pieces
was
the
shore
on
the
left
of
which
was
the
mouth
of
the
stream
the
hut
had
been
built
of
planks
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
these
planks
had
been
obtained
from
the
hull
or
deck
of
a
ship
it
was
probable
that
a
disabled
vessel
had
been
cast
on
the
coast
of
the
island
that
one
at
least
of
the
crew
had
been
saved
and
that
by
means
of
the
wreck
this
man
having
tools
at
his
disposal
had
built
the
dwelling
and
this
became
still
more
evident
when
gideon
spilett
after
having
walked
around
the
hut
saw
on
a
plank
probably
one
of
those
which
had
formed
the
armor
of
the
wrecked
vessel
these
letters
already
half
effaced
brtana
britannia
exclaimed
pencroft
whom
the
reporter
had
called
it
is
a
common
name
for
ships
and
i
could
not
say
if
she
was
english
or
american
it
matters
very
little
pencroft
very
little
indeed
answered
the
sailor
and
we
will
save
the
survivor
of
her
crew
if
he
is
still
living
to
whatever
country
he
may
belong
but
before
beginning
our
search
again
let
us
go
on
board
the
bonadventure
a
sort
of
uneasiness
had
seized
pencroft
upon
the
subject
of
his
vessel
should
the
island
be
inhabited
after
all
and
should
some
one
have
taken
possession
of
her
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
such
an
unreasonable
supposition
at
any
rate
the
sailor
was
not
sorry
to
go
to
breakfast
on
board
the
road
already
trodden
was
not
long
scarcely
a
mile
they
set
out
on
their
walk
gazing
into
the
wood
and
thickets
through
which
goats
and
pigs
fled
in
hundreds
twenty
minutes
after
leaving
the
hut
pencroft
and
his
companions
reached
the
western
coast
of
the
island
and
saw
the
bonadventure
held
fast
by
her
anchor
which
was
buried
deep
in
the
sand
pencroft
could
not
restrain
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
after
all
this
vessel
was
his
child
and
it
is
the
right
of
fathers
to
be
often
uneasy
when
there
is
no
occasion
for
it
they
returned
on
board
breakfasted
so
that
it
should
not
be
necessary
to
dine
until
very
late
then
the
repast
being
ended
the
exploration
was
continued
and
conducted
with
the
most
minute
care
indeed
it
was
very
probable
that
the
only
inhabitant
of
the
island
had
perished
it
was
therefore
more
for
the
traces
of
a
dead
than
of
a
living
man
that
pencroft
and
his
companions
searched
but
their
searches
were
vain
and
during
the
half
of
that
day
they
sought
to
no
purpose
among
the
thickets
of
trees
which
covered
the
islet
there
was
then
scarcely
any
doubt
that
if
the
castaway
was
dead
no
trace
of
his
body
now
remained
but
that
some
wild
beast
had
probably
devoured
it
to
the
last
bone
we
will
set
off
tomorrow
at
daybreak
said
pencroft
to
his
two
companions
as
about
two
oclock
they
were
resting
for
a
few
minutes
under
the
shade
of
a
clump
of
firs
i
should
think
that
we
might
without
scruple
take
the
utensils
which
belonged
to
the
castaway
added
herbert
i
think
so
too
returned
gideon
spilett
and
these
arms
and
tools
will
make
up
the
stores
of
granite
house
the
supply
of
powder
and
shot
is
also
most
important
yes
replied
pencroft
but
we
must
not
forget
to
capture
a
couple
or
two
of
those
pigs
of
which
lincoln
island
is
destitute
nor
to
gather
those
seeds
added
herbert
which
will
give
us
all
the
vegetables
of
the
old
and
the
new
worlds
then
perhaps
it
would
be
best
said
the
reporter
to
remain
a
day
longer
on
tabor
island
so
as
to
collect
all
that
may
be
useful
to
us
no
mr
spilett
answered
pencroft
i
will
ask
you
to
set
off
tomorrow
at
daybreak
the
wind
seems
to
me
to
be
likely
to
shift
to
the
west
and
after
having
had
a
fair
wind
for
coming
we
shall
have
a
fair
wind
for
going
back
then
do
not
let
us
lose
time
said
herbert
rising
we
wont
waste
time
returned
pencroft
you
herbert
go
and
gather
the
seeds
which
you
know
better
than
we
do
while
you
do
that
mr
spilett
and
i
will
go
and
have
a
pig
hunt
and
even
without
top
i
hope
we
shall
manage
to
catch
a
few
herbert
accordingly
took
the
path
which
led
towards
the
cultivated
part
of
the
islet
while
the
sailor
and
the
reporter
entered
the
forest
many
specimens
of
the
porcine
race
fled
before
them
and
these
animals
which
were
singularly
active
did
not
appear
to
be
in
a
humor
to
allow
themselves
to
be
approached
however
after
an
hours
chase
the
hunters
had
just
managed
to
get
hold
of
a
couple
lying
in
a
thicket
when
cries
were
heard
resounding
from
the
north
part
of
the
island
with
the
cries
were
mingled
terrible
yells
in
which
there
was
nothing
human
pencroft
and
gideon
spilett
were
at
once
on
their
feet
and
the
pigs
by
this
movement
began
to
run
away
at
the
moment
when
the
sailor
was
getting
ready
the
rope
to
bind
them
thats
herberts
voice
said
the
reporter
run
exclaimed
pencroft
and
the
sailor
and
spilett
immediately
ran
at
full
speed
towards
the
spot
from
whence
the
cries
proceeded
they
did
well
to
hasten
for
at
a
turn
of
the
path
near
a
clearing
they
saw
the
lad
thrown
on
the
ground
and
in
the
grasp
of
a
savage
being
apparently
a
gigantic
ape
who
was
about
to
do
him
some
great
harm
to
rush
on
this
monster
throw
him
on
the
ground
in
his
turn
snatch
herbert
from
him
then
bind
him
securely
was
the
work
of
a
minute
for
pencroft
and
gideon
spilett
the
sailor
was
of
herculean
strength
the
reporter
also
very
powerful
and
in
spite
of
the
monsters
resistance
he
was
firmly
tied
so
that
he
could
not
even
move
you
are
not
hurt
herbert
asked
spilett
no
no
oh
if
this
ape
had
wounded
him
exclaimed
pencroft
but
he
is
not
an
ape
answered
herbert
at
these
words
pencroft
and
gideon
spilett
looked
at
the
singular
being
who
lay
on
the
ground
indeed
it
was
not
an
ape
it
was
a
human
being
a
man
but
what
a
man
a
savage
in
all
the
horrible
acceptation
of
the
word
and
so
much
the
more
frightful
that
he
seemed
fallen
to
the
lowest
degree
of
brutishness
shaggy
hair
untrimmed
beard
descending
to
the
chest
the
body
almost
naked
except
a
rag
round
the
waist
wild
eyes
enormous
hands
with
immensely
long
nails
skin
the
color
of
mahogany
feet
as
hard
as
if
made
of
horn
such
was
the
miserable
creature
who
yet
had
a
claim
to
be
called
a
man
but
it
might
justly
be
asked
if
there
were
yet
a
soul
in
this
body
or
if
the
brute
instinct
alone
survived
in
it
are
you
quite
sure
that
this
is
a
man
or
that
he
has
ever
been
one
said
pencroft
to
the
reporter
alas
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
replied
spilett
then
this
must
be
the
castaway
asked
herbert
yes
replied
gideon
spilett
but
the
unfortunate
man
has
no
longer
anything
human
about
him
the
reporter
spoke
the
truth
it
was
evident
that
if
the
castaway
had
ever
been
a
civilized
being
solitude
had
made
him
a
savage
or
worse
perhaps
a
regular
man
of
the
woods
hoarse
sounds
issued
from
his
throat
between
his
teeth
which
were
sharp
as
the
teeth
of
a
wild
beast
made
to
tear
raw
flesh
memory
must
have
deserted
him
long
before
and
for
a
long
time
also
he
had
forgotten
how
to
use
his
gun
and
tools
and
he
no
longer
knew
how
to
make
a
fire
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
active
and
powerful
but
the
physical
qualities
had
been
developed
in
him
to
the
injury
of
the
moral
qualities
gideon
spilett
spoke
to
him
he
did
not
appear
to
understand
or
even
to
hear
and
yet
on
looking
into
his
eyes
the
reporter
thought
he
could
see
that
all
reason
was
not
extinguished
in
him
however
the
prisoner
did
not
struggle
nor
even
attempt
to
break
his
bonds
was
he
overwhelmed
by
the
presence
of
men
whose
fellow
he
had
once
been
had
he
found
in
some
corner
of
his
brain
a
fleeting
remembrance
which
recalled
him
to
humanity
if
free
would
he
attempt
to
fly
or
would
he
remain
they
could
not
tell
but
they
did
not
make
the
experiment
and
after
gazing
attentively
at
the
miserable
creature
whoever
he
may
be
remarked
gideon
spilett
whoever
he
may
have
been
and
whatever
he
may
become
it
is
our
duty
to
take
him
with
us
to
lincoln
island
yes
yes
replied
herbert
and
perhaps
with
care
we
may
arouse
in
him
some
gleam
of
intelligence
the
soul
does
not
die
said
the
reporter
and
it
would
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
rescue
one
of
gods
creatures
from
brutishness
pencroft
shook
his
head
doubtfully
we
must
try
at
any
rate
returned
the
reporter
humanity
commands
us
it
was
indeed
their
duty
as
christians
and
civilized
beings
all
three
felt
this
and
they
well
knew
that
cyrus
harding
would
approve
of
their
acting
thus
shall
we
leave
him
bound
asked
the
sailor
perhaps
he
would
walk
if
his
feet
were
unfastened
said
herbert
let
us
try
replied
pencroft
the
cords
which
shackled
the
prisoners
feet
were
cut
off
but
his
arms
remained
securely
fastened
he
got
up
by
himself
and
did
not
manifest
any
desire
to
run
away
his
hard
eyes
darted
a
piercing
glance
at
the
three
men
who
walked
near
him
but
nothing
denoted
that
he
recollected
being
their
fellow
or
at
least
having
been
so
a
continual
hissing
sound
issued
from
his
lips
his
aspect
was
wild
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
resist
by
the
reporters
advice
the
unfortunate
man
was
taken
to
the
hut
perhaps
the
sight
of
the
things
that
belonged
to
him
would
make
some
impression
on
him
perhaps
a
spark
would
be
sufficient
to
revive
his
obscured
intellect
to
rekindle
his
dulled
soul
the
dwelling
was
not
far
off
in
a
few
minutes
they
arrived
there
but
the
prisoner
remembered
nothing
and
it
appeared
that
he
had
lost
consciousness
of
everything
what
could
they
think
of
the
degree
of
brutishness
into
which
this
miserable
being
had
fallen
unless
that
his
imprisonment
on
the
islet
dated
from
a
very
distant
period
and
after
having
arrived
there
a
rational
being
solitude
had
reduced
him
to
this
condition
the
reporter
then
thought
that
perhaps
the
sight
of
fire
would
have
some
effect
on
him
and
in
a
moment
one
of
those
beautiful
flames
that
attract
even
animals
blazed
up
on
the
hearth
the
sight
of
the
flame
seemed
at
first
to
fix
the
attention
of
the
unhappy
object
but
soon
he
turned
away
and
the
look
of
intelligence
faded
evidently
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
the
time
at
least
but
to
take
him
on
board
the
bonadventure
this
was
done
and
he
remained
there
in
pencrofts
charge
herbert
and
spilett
returned
to
finish
their
work
and
some
hours
after
they
came
back
to
the
shore
carrying
the
utensils
and
guns
a
store
of
vegetables
of
seeds
some
game
and
two
couple
of
pigs
all
was
embarked
and
the
bonadventure
was
ready
to
weigh
anchor
and
sail
with
the
morning
tide
the
prisoner
had
been
placed
in
the
forecabin
where
he
remained
quiet
silent
apparently
deaf
and
dumb
pencroft
offered
him
something
to
eat
but
he
pushed
away
the
cooked
meat
that
was
presented
to
him
and
which
doubtless
did
not
suit
him
but
on
the
sailor
showing
him
one
of
the
ducks
which
herbert
had
killed
he
pounced
on
it
like
a
wild
beast
and
devoured
it
greedily
you
think
that
he
will
recover
his
senses
asked
pencroft
it
is
not
impossible
that
our
care
will
have
an
effect
upon
him
for
it
is
solitude
that
has
made
him
what
he
is
and
from
this
time
forward
he
will
be
no
longer
alone
the
poor
man
must
no
doubt
have
been
in
this
state
for
a
long
time
said
herbert
perhaps
answered
gideon
spilett
about
what
age
is
he
asked
the
lad
it
is
difficult
to
say
replied
the
reporter
for
it
is
impossible
to
see
his
features
under
the
thick
beard
which
covers
his
face
but
he
is
no
longer
young
and
i
suppose
he
might
be
about
fifty
have
you
noticed
mr
spilett
how
deeply
sunk
his
eyes
are
asked
herbert
yes
herbert
but
i
must
add
that
they
are
more
human
than
one
could
expect
from
his
appearance
however
we
shall
see
replied
pencroft
and
i
am
anxious
to
know
what
opinion
captain
harding
will
have
of
our
savage
we
went
to
look
for
a
human
creature
and
we
are
bringing
back
a
monster
after
all
we
did
what
we
could
the
night
passed
and
whether
the
prisoner
slept
or
not
could
not
be
known
but
at
any
rate
although
he
had
been
unbound
he
did
not
move
he
was
like
a
wild
animal
which
appears
stunned
at
first
by
its
capture
and
becomes
wild
again
afterwards
at
daybreak
the
next
morning
the
15th
of
october
the
change
of
weather
predicted
by
pencroft
occurred
the
wind
having
shifted
to
the
northwest
favored
the
return
of
the
bonadventure
but
at
the
same
time
it
freshened
which
might
render
navigation
more
difficult
at
five
oclock
in
the
morning
the
anchor
was
weighed
pencroft
took
a
reef
in
the
mainsail
and
steered
towards
the
northeast
so
as
to
sail
straight
for
lincoln
island
the
first
day
of
the
voyage
was
not
marked
by
any
incident
the
prisoner
remained
quiet
in
the
forecabin
and
as
he
had
been
a
sailor
it
appeared
that
the
motion
of
the
vessel
might
produce
on
him
a
salutary
reaction
did
some
recollection
of
his
former
calling
return
to
him
however
that
might
be
he
remained
tranquil
astonished
rather
than
depressed
the
next
day
the
wind
increased
blowing
more
from
the
north
consequently
in
a
less
favorable
direction
for
the
bonadventure
pencroft
was
soon
obliged
to
sail
closehauled
and
without
saying
anything
about
it
he
began
to
be
uneasy
at
the
state
of
the
sea
which
frequently
broke
over
the
bows
certainly
if
the
wind
did
not
moderate
it
would
take
a
longer
time
to
reach
lincoln
island
than
it
had
taken
to
make
tabor
island
indeed
on
the
morning
of
the
17th
the
bonadventure
had
been
fortyeight
hours
at
sea
and
nothing
showed
that
she
was
near
the
island
it
was
impossible
besides
to
estimate
the
distance
traversed
or
to
trust
to
the
reckoning
for
the
direction
as
the
speed
had
been
very
irregular
twentyfour
hours
after
there
was
yet
no
land
in
sight
the
wind
was
right
ahead
and
the
sea
very
heavy
the
sails
were
closereefed
and
they
tacked
frequently
on
the
18th
a
wave
swept
completely
over
the
bonadventure
and
if
the
crew
had
not
taken
the
precaution
of
lashing
themselves
to
the
deck
they
would
have
been
carried
away
on
this
occasion
pencroft
and
his
companions
who
were
occupied
with
loosing
themselves
received
unexpected
aid
from
the
prisoner
who
emerged
from
the
hatchway
as
if
his
sailors
instinct
had
suddenly
returned
broke
a
piece
out
of
the
bulwarks
with
a
spar
so
as
to
let
the
water
which
filled
the
deck
escape
then
the
vessel
being
clear
he
descended
to
his
cabin
without
having
uttered
a
word
pencroft
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
greatly
astonished
let
him
proceed
their
situation
was
truly
serious
and
the
sailor
had
reason
to
fear
that
he
was
lost
on
the
wide
sea
without
any
possibility
of
recovering
his
course
the
night
was
dark
and
cold
however
about
eleven
oclock
the
wind
fell
the
sea
went
down
and
the
speed
of
the
vessel
as
she
labored
less
greatly
increased
neither
pencroft
spilett
nor
herbert
thought
of
taking
an
hours
sleep
they
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
either
lincoln
island
could
not
be
far
distant
and
would
be
sighted
at
daybreak
or
the
bonadventure
carried
away
by
currents
had
drifted
so
much
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
rectify
her
course
pencroft
uneasy
to
the
last
degree
yet
did
not
despair
for
he
had
a
gallant
heart
and
grasping
the
tiller
he
anxiously
endeavored
to
pierce
the
darkness
which
surrounded
them
about
two
oclock
in
the
morning
he
started
forward
a
light
a
light
he
shouted
indeed
a
bright
light
appeared
twenty
miles
to
the
northeast
lincoln
island
was
there
and
this
fire
evidently
lighted
by
cyrus
harding
showed
them
the
course
to
be
followed
pencroft
who
was
bearing
too
much
to
the
north
altered
his
course
and
steered
towards
the
fire
which
burned
brightly
above
the
horizon
like
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
chapter
15
the
next
day
the
20th
of
october
at
seven
oclock
in
the
morning
after
a
voyage
of
four
days
the
bonadventure
gently
glided
up
to
the
beach
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
cyrus
harding
and
neb
who
had
become
very
uneasy
at
the
bad
weather
and
the
prolonged
absence
of
their
companions
had
climbed
at
daybreak
to
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
and
they
had
at
last
caught
sight
of
the
vessel
which
had
been
so
long
in
returning
god
be
praised
there
they
are
exclaimed
cyrus
harding
as
to
neb
in
his
joy
he
began
to
dance
to
twirl
round
clapping
his
hands
and
shouting
oh
my
master
a
more
touching
pantomime
than
the
finest
discourse
the
engineers
first
idea
on
counting
the
people
on
the
deck
of
the
bonadventure
was
that
pencroft
had
not
found
the
castaway
of
tabor
island
or
at
any
rate
that
the
unfortunate
man
had
refused
to
leave
his
island
and
change
one
prison
for
another
indeed
pencroft
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
were
alone
on
the
deck
of
the
bonadventure
the
moment
the
vessel
touched
the
engineer
and
neb
were
waiting
on
the
beach
and
before
the
passengers
had
time
to
leap
on
to
the
sand
harding
said
we
have
been
very
uneasy
at
your
delay
my
friends
did
you
meet
with
any
accident
no
replied
gideon
spilett
on
the
contrary
everything
went
wonderfully
well
we
will
tell
you
all
about
it
however
returned
the
engineer
your
search
has
been
unsuccessful
since
you
are
only
three
just
as
you
went
excuse
me
captain
replied
the
sailor
we
are
four
you
have
found
the
castaway
yes
and
you
have
brought
him
yes
living
yes
where
is
he
who
is
he
he
is
replied
the
reporter
or
rather
he
was
a
man
there
cyrus
that
is
all
we
can
tell
you
the
engineer
was
then
informed
of
all
that
had
passed
during
the
voyage
and
under
what
conditions
the
search
had
been
conducted
how
the
only
dwelling
in
the
island
had
long
been
abandoned
how
at
last
a
castaway
had
been
captured
who
appeared
no
longer
to
belong
to
the
human
species
and
thats
just
the
point
added
pencroft
i
dont
know
if
we
have
done
right
to
bring
him
here
certainly
you
have
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
quickly
but
the
wretched
creature
has
no
sense
that
is
possible
at
present
replied
cyrus
harding
but
only
a
few
months
ago
the
wretched
creature
was
a
man
like
you
and
me
and
who
knows
what
will
become
of
the
survivor
of
us
after
a
long
solitude
on
this
island
it
is
a
great
misfortune
to
be
alone
my
friends
and
it
must
be
believed
that
solitude
can
quickly
destroy
reason
since
you
have
found
this
poor
creature
in
such
a
state
but
captain
asked
herbert
what
leads
you
to
think
that
the
brutishness
of
the
unfortunate
man
began
only
a
few
months
back
because
the
document
we
found
had
been
recently
written
answered
the
engineer
and
the
castaway
alone
can
have
written
it
always
supposing
observed
gideon
spilett
that
it
had
not
been
written
by
a
companion
of
this
man
since
dead
that
is
impossible
my
dear
spilett
why
so
asked
the
reporter
because
the
document
would
then
have
spoken
of
two
castaways
replied
harding
and
it
mentioned
only
one
herbert
then
in
a
few
words
related
the
incidents
of
the
voyage
and
dwelt
on
the
curious
fact
of
the
sort
of
passing
gleam
in
the
prisoners
mind
when
for
an
instant
in
the
height
of
the
storm
he
had
become
a
sailor
well
herbert
replied
the
engineer
you
are
right
to
attach
great
importance
to
this
fact
the
unfortunate
man
cannot
be
incurable
and
despair
has
made
him
what
he
is
but
here
he
will
find
his
fellowmen
and
since
there
is
still
a
soul
in
him
this
soul
we
shall
save
the
castaway
of
tabor
island
to
the
great
pity
of
the
engineer
and
the
great
astonishment
of
neb
was
then
brought
from
the
cabin
which
he
occupied
in
the
fore
part
of
the
bonadventure
when
once
on
land
he
manifested
a
wish
to
run
away
but
cyrus
harding
approaching
placed
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
with
a
gesture
full
of
authority
and
looked
at
him
with
infinite
tenderness
immediately
the
unhappy
man
submitting
to
a
superior
will
gradually
became
calm
his
eyes
fell
his
head
bent
and
he
made
no
more
resistance
poor
fellow
murmured
the
engineer
cyrus
harding
had
attentively
observed
him
to
judge
by
his
appearance
this
miserable
being
had
no
longer
anything
human
about
him
and
yet
harding
as
had
the
reporter
already
observed
in
his
look
an
indefinable
trace
of
intelligence
it
was
decided
that
the
castaway
or
rather
the
stranger
as
he
was
thenceforth
termed
by
his
companions
should
live
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
granite
house
from
which
however
he
could
not
escape
he
was
led
there
without
difficulty
and
with
careful
attention
it
might
perhaps
be
hoped
that
some
day
he
would
be
a
companion
to
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
cyrus
harding
during
breakfast
which
neb
had
hastened
to
prepare
as
the
reporter
herbert
and
pencroft
were
dying
of
hunger
heard
in
detail
all
the
incidents
which
had
marked
the
voyage
of
exploration
to
the
islet
he
agreed
with
his
friends
on
this
point
that
the
stranger
must
be
either
english
or
american
the
name
britannia
leading
them
to
suppose
this
and
besides
through
the
bushy
beard
and
under
the
shaggy
matted
hair
the
engineer
thought
he
could
recognize
the
characteristic
features
of
the
anglosaxon
but
by
the
bye
said
gideon
spilett
addressing
herbert
you
never
told
us
how
you
met
this
savage
and
we
know
nothing
except
that
you
would
have
been
strangled
if
we
had
not
happened
to
come
up
in
time
to
help
you
upon
my
word
answered
herbert
it
is
rather
difficult
to
say
how
it
happened
i
was
i
think
occupied
in
collecting
my
plants
when
i
heard
a
noise
like
an
avalanche
falling
from
a
very
tall
tree
i
scarcely
had
time
to
look
round
this
unfortunate
man
who
was
without
doubt
concealed
in
a
tree
rushed
upon
me
in
less
time
than
i
take
to
tell
you
about
it
and
unless
mr
spilett
and
pencroft
my
boy
said
cyrus
harding
you
ran
a
great
danger
but
perhaps
without
that
the
poor
creature
would
have
still
hidden
himself
from
your
search
and
we
should
not
have
had
a
new
companion
you
hope
then
cyrus
to
succeed
in
reforming
the
man
asked
the
reporter
yes
replied
the
engineer
breakfast
over
harding
and
his
companions
left
granite
house
and
returned
to
the
beach
they
there
occupied
themselves
in
unloading
the
bonadventure
and
the
engineer
having
examined
the
arms
and
tools
saw
nothing
which
could
help
them
to
establish
the
identity
of
the
stranger
the
capture
of
pigs
made
on
the
islet
was
looked
upon
as
being
very
profitable
to
lincoln
island
and
the
animals
were
led
to
the
sty
where
they
soon
became
at
home
the
two
barrels
containing
the
powder
and
shot
as
well
as
the
box
of
caps
were
very
welcome
it
was
agreed
to
establish
a
small
powdermagazine
either
outside
granite
house
or
in
the
upper
cavern
where
there
would
be
no
fear
of
explosion
however
the
use
of
pyroxyle
was
to
be
continued
for
this
substance
giving
excellent
results
there
was
no
reason
for
substituting
ordinary
powder
when
the
unloading
of
the
vessel
was
finished
captain
said
pencroft
i
think
it
would
be
prudent
to
put
our
bonadventure
in
a
safe
place
is
she
not
safe
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
asked
cyrus
harding
no
captain
replied
the
sailor
half
of
the
time
she
is
stranded
on
the
sand
and
that
works
her
she
is
a
famous
craft
you
see
and
she
behaved
admirably
during
the
squall
which
struck
us
on
our
return
could
she
not
float
in
the
river
no
doubt
captain
she
could
but
there
is
no
shelter
there
and
in
the
east
winds
i
think
that
the
bonadventure
would
suffer
much
from
the
surf
well
where
would
you
put
her
pencroft
in
port
balloon
replied
the
sailor
that
little
creek
shut
in
by
rocks
seems
to
me
to
be
just
the
harbor
we
want
is
it
not
rather
far
pooh
it
is
not
more
than
three
miles
from
granite
house
and
we
have
a
fine
straight
road
to
take
us
there
do
it
then
pencroft
and
take
your
bonadventure
there
replied
the
engineer
and
yet
i
would
rather
have
her
under
our
more
immediate
protection
when
we
have
time
we
must
make
a
little
harbor
for
her
famous
exclaimed
pencroft
a
harbor
with
a
lighthouse
a
pier
and
dock
ah
really
with
you
captain
everything
becomes
easy
yes
my
brave
pencroft
answered
the
engineer
but
on
condition
however
that
you
help
me
for
you
do
as
much
as
three
men
in
all
our
work
herbert
and
the
sailor
then
reembarked
on
board
the
bonadventure
the
anchor
was
weighed
the
sail
hoisted
and
the
wind
drove
her
rapidly
towards
claw
cape
two
hours
after
she
was
reposing
on
the
tranquil
waters
of
port
balloon
during
the
first
days
passed
by
the
stranger
in
granite
house
had
he
already
given
them
reason
to
think
that
his
savage
nature
was
becoming
tamed
did
a
brighter
light
burn
in
the
depths
of
that
obscured
mind
in
short
was
the
soul
returning
to
the
body
yes
to
a
certainty
and
to
such
a
degree
that
cyrus
harding
and
the
reporter
wondered
if
the
reason
of
the
unfortunate
man
had
ever
been
totally
extinguished
at
first
accustomed
to
the
open
air
to
the
unrestrained
liberty
which
he
had
enjoyed
on
tabor
island
the
stranger
manifested
a
sullen
fury
and
it
was
feared
that
he
might
throw
himself
onto
the
beach
out
of
one
of
the
windows
of
granite
house
but
gradually
he
became
calmer
and
more
freedom
was
allowed
to
his
movements
they
had
reason
to
hope
and
to
hope
much
already
forgetting
his
carnivorous
instincts
the
stranger
accepted
a
less
bestial
nourishment
than
that
on
which
he
fed
on
the
islet
and
cooked
meat
did
not
produce
in
him
the
same
sentiment
of
repulsion
which
he
had
showed
on
board
the
bonadventure
cyrus
harding
had
profited
by
a
moment
when
he
was
sleeping
to
cut
his
hair
and
matted
beard
which
formed
a
sort
of
mane
and
gave
him
such
a
savage
aspect
he
had
also
been
clothed
more
suitably
after
having
got
rid
of
the
rag
which
covered
him
the
result
was
that
thanks
to
these
attentions
the
stranger
resumed
a
more
human
appearance
and
it
even
seemed
as
if
his
eyes
had
become
milder
certainly
when
formerly
lighted
up
by
intelligence
this
mans
face
must
have
had
a
sort
of
beauty
every
day
harding
imposed
on
himself
the
task
of
passing
some
hours
in
his
company
he
came
and
worked
near
him
and
occupied
himself
in
different
things
so
as
to
fix
his
attention
a
spark
indeed
would
be
sufficient
to
reillumine
that
soul
a
recollection
crossing
that
brain
to
recall
reason
that
had
been
seen
during
the
storm
on
board
the
bonadventure
the
engineer
did
not
neglect
either
to
speak
aloud
so
as
to
penetrate
at
the
same
time
by
the
organs
of
hearing
and
sight
the
depths
of
that
torpid
intelligence
sometimes
one
of
his
companions
sometimes
another
sometimes
all
joined
him
they
spoke
most
often
of
things
belonging
to
the
navy
which
must
interest
a
sailor
at
times
the
stranger
gave
some
slight
attention
to
what
was
said
and
the
settlers
were
soon
convinced
that
he
partly
understood
them
sometimes
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
deeply
sorrowful
a
proof
that
he
suffered
mentally
for
his
face
could
not
be
mistaken
but
he
did
not
speak
although
at
different
times
however
they
almost
thought
that
words
were
about
to
issue
from
his
lips
at
all
events
the
poor
creature
was
quite
quiet
and
sad
but
was
not
his
calm
only
apparent
was
not
his
sadness
only
the
result
of
his
seclusion
nothing
could
yet
be
ascertained
seeing
only
certain
objects
and
in
a
limited
space
always
in
contact
with
the
colonists
to
whom
he
would
soon
become
accustomed
having
no
desires
to
satisfy
better
fed
better
clothed
it
was
natural
that
his
physical
nature
should
gradually
improve
but
was
he
penetrated
with
the
sense
of
a
new
life
or
rather
to
employ
a
word
which
would
be
exactly
applicable
to
him
was
he
not
becoming
tamed
like
an
animal
in
company
with
his
master
this
was
an
important
question
which
cyrus
harding
was
anxious
to
answer
and
yet
he
did
not
wish
to
treat
his
invalid
roughly
would
he
ever
be
a
convalescent
how
the
engineer
observed
him
every
moment
how
he
was
on
the
watch
for
his
soul
if
one
may
use
the
expression
how
he
was
ready
to
grasp
it
the
settlers
followed
with
real
sympathy
all
the
phases
of
the
cure
undertaken
by
harding
they
aided
him
also
in
this
work
of
humanity
and
all
except
perhaps
the
incredulous
pencroft
soon
shared
both
his
hope
and
his
faith
the
calm
of
the
stranger
was
deep
as
has
been
said
and
he
even
showed
a
sort
of
attachment
for
the
engineer
whose
influence
he
evidently
felt
cyrus
harding
resolved
then
to
try
him
by
transporting
him
to
another
scene
from
that
ocean
which
formerly
his
eyes
had
been
accustomed
to
contemplate
to
the
border
of
the
forest
which
might
perhaps
recall
those
where
so
many
years
of
his
life
had
been
passed
but
said
gideon
spilett
can
we
hope
that
he
will
not
escape
if
once
set
at
liberty
the
experiment
must
be
tried
replied
the
engineer
well
said
pencroft
when
that
fellow
is
outside
and
feels
the
fresh
air
he
will
be
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
can
carry
him
i
do
not
think
so
returned
harding
let
us
try
said
spilett
we
will
try
replied
the
engineer
this
was
on
the
30th
of
october
and
consequently
the
castaway
of
tabor
island
had
been
a
prisoner
in
granite
house
for
nine
days
it
was
warm
and
a
bright
sun
darted
its
rays
on
the
island
cyrus
harding
and
pencroft
went
to
the
room
occupied
by
the
stranger
who
was
found
lying
near
the
window
and
gazing
at
the
sky
come
my
friend
said
the
engineer
to
him
the
stranger
rose
immediately
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
cyrus
harding
and
he
followed
him
while
the
sailor
marched
behind
them
little
confident
as
to
the
result
of
the
experiment
arrived
at
the
door
harding
and
pencroft
made
him
take
his
place
in
the
lift
while
neb
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
waited
for
them
before
granite
house
the
lift
descended
and
in
a
few
moments
all
were
united
on
the
beach
the
settlers
went
a
short
distance
from
the
stranger
so
as
to
leave
him
at
liberty
he
then
made
a
few
steps
toward
the
sea
and
his
look
brightened
with
extreme
animation
but
he
did
not
make
the
slightest
attempt
to
escape
he
was
gazing
at
the
little
waves
which
broken
by
the
islet
rippled
on
the
sand
this
is
only
the
sea
observed
gideon
spilett
and
possibly
it
does
not
inspire
him
with
any
wish
to
escape
yes
replied
harding
we
must
take
him
to
the
plateau
on
the
border
of
the
forest
there
the
experiment
will
be
more
conclusive
besides
he
could
not
run
away
said
neb
since
the
bridge
is
raised
oh
said
pencroft
that
isnt
a
man
to
be
troubled
by
a
stream
like
creek
glycerine
he
could
cross
it
directly
at
a
single
bound
we
shall
soon
see
harding
contented
himself
with
replying
his
eyes
not
quitting
those
of
his
patient
the
latter
was
then
led
towards
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
and
all
climbing
the
left
bank
of
the
river
reached
prospect
heights
arrived
at
the
spot
on
which
grew
the
first
beautiful
trees
of
the
forest
their
foliage
slightly
agitated
by
the
breeze
the
stranger
appeared
greedily
to
drink
in
the
penetrating
odor
which
filled
the
atmosphere
and
a
long
sigh
escaped
from
his
chest
the
settlers
kept
behind
him
ready
to
seize
him
if
he
made
any
movement
to
escape
and
indeed
the
poor
creature
was
on
the
point
of
springing
into
the
creek
which
separated
him
from
the
forest
and
his
legs
were
bent
for
an
instant
as
if
for
a
spring
but
almost
immediately
he
stepped
back
half
sank
down
and
a
large
tear
fell
from
his
eyes
ah
exclaimed
cyrus
harding
you
have
become
a
man
again
for
you
can
weep
chapter
16
yes
the
unfortunate
man
had
wept
some
recollection
doubtless
had
flashed
across
his
brain
and
to
use
cyrus
hardings
expression
by
those
tears
he
was
once
more
a
man
the
colonists
left
him
for
some
time
on
the
plateau
and
withdrew
themselves
to
a
short
distance
so
that
he
might
feel
himself
free
but
he
did
not
think
of
profiting
by
this
liberty
and
harding
soon
brought
him
back
to
granite
house
two
days
after
this
occurrence
the
stranger
appeared
to
wish
gradually
to
mingle
with
their
common
life
he
evidently
heard
and
understood
but
no
less
evidently
was
he
strangely
determined
not
to
speak
to
the
colonists
for
one
evening
pencroft
listening
at
the
door
of
his
room
heard
these
words
escape
from
his
lips
no
here
i
never
the
sailor
reported
these
words
to
his
companions
there
is
some
painful
mystery
there
said
harding
the
stranger
had
begun
to
use
the
laboring
tools
and
he
worked
in
the
garden
when
he
stopped
in
his
work
as
was
often
the
case
he
remained
retired
within
himself
but
on
the
engineers
recommendation
they
respected
the
reserve
which
he
apparently
wished
to
keep
if
one
of
the
settlers
approached
him
he
drew
back
and
his
chest
heaved
with
sobs
as
if
overburdened
was
it
remorse
that
overwhelmed
him
thus
they
were
compelled
to
believe
so
and
gideon
spilett
could
not
help
one
day
making
this
observation
if
he
does
not
speak
it
is
because
he
has
i
fear
things
too
serious
to
be
told
they
must
be
patient
and
wait
a
few
days
later
on
the
3rd
of
november
the
stranger
working
on
the
plateau
had
stopped
letting
his
spade
drop
to
the
ground
and
harding
who
was
observing
him
from
a
little
distance
saw
that
tears
were
again
flowing
from
his
eyes
a
sort
of
irresistible
pity
led
him
towards
the
unfortunate
man
and
he
touched
his
arm
lightly
my
friend
said
he
the
stranger
tried
to
avoid
his
look
and
cyrus
harding
having
endeavored
to
take
his
hand
he
drew
back
quickly
my
friend
said
harding
in
a
firmer
voice
look
at
me
i
wish
it
the
stranger
looked
at
the
engineer
and
seemed
to
be
under
his
power
as
a
subject
under
the
influence
of
a
mesmerist
he
wished
to
run
away
but
then
his
countenance
suddenly
underwent
a
transformation
his
eyes
flashed
words
struggled
to
escape
from
his
lips
he
could
no
longer
contain
himself
at
last
he
folded
his
arms
then
in
a
hollow
voicewho
are
you
he
asked
cyrus
harding
castaways
like
you
replied
the
engineer
whose
emotion
was
deep
we
have
brought
you
here
among
your
fellowmen
my
fellowmen
i
have
none
you
are
in
the
midst
of
friends
friendsfor
me
friends
exclaimed
the
stranger
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
noneverleave
me
leave
me
then
he
rushed
to
the
side
of
the
plateau
which
overlooked
the
sea
and
remained
there
a
long
time
motionless
harding
rejoined
his
companions
and
related
to
them
what
had
just
happened
yes
there
is
some
mystery
in
that
mans
life
said
gideon
spilett
and
it
appears
as
if
he
had
only
reentered
society
by
the
path
of
remorse
i
dont
know
what
sort
of
a
man
we
have
brought
here
said
the
sailor
he
has
secrets
which
we
will
respect
interrupted
cyrus
harding
quickly
if
he
has
committed
any
crime
he
has
most
fearfully
expiated
it
and
in
our
eyes
he
is
absolved
for
two
hours
the
stranger
remained
alone
on
the
shore
evidently
under
the
influence
of
recollections
which
recalled
all
his
past
lifea
melancholy
life
doubtlessand
the
colonists
without
losing
sight
of
him
did
not
attempt
to
disturb
his
solitude
however
after
two
hours
appearing
to
have
formed
a
resolution
he
came
to
find
cyrus
harding
his
eyes
were
red
with
the
tears
he
had
shed
but
he
wept
no
longer
his
countenance
expressed
deep
humility
he
appeared
anxious
timorous
ashamed
and
his
eyes
were
constantly
fixed
on
the
ground
sir
said
he
to
harding
your
companions
and
you
are
you
english
no
answered
the
engineer
we
are
americans
ah
said
the
stranger
and
he
murmured
i
prefer
that
and
you
my
friend
asked
the
engineer
english
replied
he
hastily
and
as
if
these
few
words
had
been
difficult
to
say
he
retreated
to
the
beach
where
he
walked
up
and
down
between
the
cascade
and
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
in
a
state
of
extreme
agitation
then
passing
one
moment
close
to
herbert
he
stopped
and
in
a
stifled
voice
what
month
he
asked
december
replied
herbert
what
year
1866
twelve
years
twelve
years
he
exclaimed
then
he
left
him
abruptly
herbert
reported
to
the
colonists
the
questions
and
answers
which
had
been
made
this
unfortunate
man
observed
gideon
spilett
was
no
longer
acquainted
with
either
months
or
years
yes
added
herbert
and
he
had
been
twelve
years
already
on
the
islet
when
we
found
him
there
twelve
years
rejoined
harding
ah
twelve
years
of
solitude
after
a
wicked
life
perhaps
may
well
impair
a
mans
reason
i
am
induced
to
think
said
pencroft
that
this
man
was
not
wrecked
on
tabor
island
but
that
in
consequence
of
some
crime
he
was
left
there
you
must
be
right
pencroft
replied
the
reporter
and
if
it
is
so
it
is
not
impossible
that
those
who
left
him
on
the
island
may
return
to
fetch
him
some
day
and
they
will
no
longer
find
him
said
herbert
but
then
added
pencroft
they
must
return
and
my
friends
said
cyrus
harding
do
not
let
us
discuss
this
question
until
we
know
more
about
it
i
believe
that
the
unhappy
man
has
suffered
that
he
has
severely
expiated
his
faults
whatever
they
may
have
been
and
that
the
wish
to
unburden
himself
stifles
him
do
not
let
us
press
him
to
tell
us
his
history
he
will
tell
it
to
us
doubtless
and
when
we
know
it
we
shall
see
what
course
it
will
be
best
to
follow
he
alone
besides
can
tell
us
if
he
has
more
than
a
hope
a
certainty
of
returning
some
day
to
his
country
but
i
doubt
it
and
why
asked
the
reporter
because
that
in
the
event
of
his
being
sure
of
being
delivered
at
a
certain
time
he
would
have
waited
the
hour
of
his
deliverance
and
would
not
have
thrown
this
document
into
the
sea
no
it
is
more
probable
that
he
was
condemned
to
die
on
that
islet
and
that
he
never
expected
to
see
his
fellowcreatures
again
but
observed
the
sailor
there
is
one
thing
which
i
cannot
explain
what
is
it
if
this
man
had
been
left
for
twelve
years
on
tabor
island
one
may
well
suppose
that
he
had
been
several
years
already
in
the
wild
state
in
which
we
found
him
that
is
probable
replied
cyrus
harding
it
must
then
be
many
years
since
he
wrote
that
document
no
doubt
and
yet
the
document
appears
to
have
been
recently
written
besides
how
do
you
know
that
the
bottle
which
enclosed
the
document
may
not
have
taken
several
years
to
come
from
tabor
island
to
lincoln
island
that
is
not
absolutely
impossible
replied
the
reporter
might
it
not
have
been
a
long
time
already
on
the
coast
of
the
island
no
answered
pencroft
for
it
was
still
floating
we
could
not
even
suppose
that
after
it
had
stayed
for
any
length
of
time
on
the
shore
it
would
have
been
swept
off
by
the
sea
for
the
south
coast
is
all
rocks
and
it
would
certainly
have
been
smashed
to
pieces
there
that
is
true
rejoined
cyrus
harding
thoughtfully
and
then
continued
the
sailor
if
the
document
was
several
years
old
if
it
had
been
shut
up
in
that
bottle
for
several
years
it
would
have
been
injured
by
damp
now
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
and
it
was
found
in
a
perfect
state
of
preservation
the
sailors
reasoning
was
very
just
and
pointed
out
an
incomprehensible
fact
for
the
document
appeared
to
have
been
recently
written
when
the
colonists
found
it
in
the
bottle
moreover
it
gave
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
tabor
island
correctly
which
implied
that
its
author
had
a
more
complete
knowledge
of
hydrography
than
could
be
expected
of
a
common
sailor
there
is
in
this
again
something
unaccountable
said
the
engineer
but
we
will
not
urge
our
companion
to
speak
when
he
likes
my
friends
then
we
shall
be
ready
to
hear
him
during
the
following
days
the
stranger
did
not
speak
a
word
and
did
not
once
leave
the
precincts
of
the
plateau
he
worked
away
without
losing
a
moment
without
taking
a
minutes
rest
but
always
in
a
retired
place
at
meal
times
he
never
came
to
granite
house
although
invited
several
times
to
do
so
but
contented
himself
with
eating
a
few
raw
vegetables
at
nightfall
he
did
not
return
to
the
room
assigned
to
him
but
remained
under
some
clump
of
trees
or
when
the
weather
was
bad
crouched
in
some
cleft
of
the
rocks
thus
he
lived
in
the
same
manner
as
when
he
had
no
other
shelter
than
the
forests
of
tabor
island
and
as
all
persuasion
to
induce
him
to
improve
his
life
was
in
vain
the
colonists
waited
patiently
and
the
time
was
near
when
as
it
seemed
almost
involuntarily
urged
by
his
conscience
a
terrible
confession
escaped
him
on
the
10th
of
november
about
eight
oclock
in
the
evening
as
night
was
coming
on
the
stranger
appeared
unexpectedly
before
the
settlers
who
were
assembled
under
the
veranda
his
eyes
burned
strangely
and
he
had
quite
resumed
the
wild
aspect
of
his
worst
days
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
were
astounded
on
seeing
that
overcome
by
some
terrible
emotion
his
teeth
chattered
like
those
of
a
person
in
a
fever
what
was
the
matter
with
him
was
the
sight
of
his
fellowcreatures
insupportable
to
him
was
he
weary
of
this
return
to
a
civilized
mode
of
existence
was
he
pining
for
his
former
savage
life
it
appeared
so
as
soon
he
was
heard
to
express
himself
in
these
incoherent
sentences
why
am
i
here
by
what
right
have
you
dragged
me
from
my
islet
do
you
think
there
could
be
any
tie
between
you
and
me
do
you
know
who
i
amwhat
i
have
donewhy
i
was
therealone
and
who
told
you
that
i
was
not
abandoned
therethat
i
was
not
condemned
to
die
there
do
you
know
my
past
how
do
you
know
that
i
have
not
stolen
murderedthat
i
am
not
a
wretchan
accursed
beingonly
fit
to
live
like
a
wild
beast
far
from
allspeakdo
you
know
it
the
colonists
listened
without
interrupting
the
miserable
creature
from
whom
these
broken
confessions
escaped
as
it
were
in
spite
of
himself
harding
wishing
to
calm
him
approached
him
but
he
hastily
drew
back
no
no
he
exclaimed
one
word
onlyam
i
free
you
are
free
answered
the
engineer
farewell
then
he
cried
and
fled
like
a
madman
neb
pencroft
and
herbert
ran
also
towards
the
edge
of
the
woodbut
they
returned
alone
we
must
let
him
alone
said
cyrus
harding
he
will
never
come
back
exclaimed
pencroft
he
will
come
back
replied
the
engineer
many
days
passed
but
hardingwas
it
a
sort
of
presentimentpersisted
in
the
fixed
idea
that
sooner
or
later
the
unhappy
man
would
return
it
is
the
last
revolt
of
his
wild
nature
said
he
which
remorse
has
touched
and
which
renewed
solitude
will
terrify
in
the
meanwhile
works
of
all
sorts
were
continued
as
well
on
prospect
heights
as
at
the
corral
where
harding
intended
to
build
a
farm
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
the
seeds
collected
by
herbert
on
tabor
island
had
been
carefully
sown
the
plateau
thus
formed
one
immense
kitchengarden
well
laid
out
and
carefully
tended
so
that
the
arms
of
the
settlers
were
never
in
want
of
work
there
was
always
something
to
be
done
as
the
esculents
increased
in
number
it
became
necessary
to
enlarge
the
simple
beds
which
threatened
to
grow
into
regular
fields
and
replace
the
meadows
but
grass
abounded
in
other
parts
of
the
island
and
there
was
no
fear
of
the
onagers
being
obliged
to
go
on
short
allowance
it
was
well
worth
while
besides
to
turn
prospect
heights
into
a
kitchengarden
defended
by
its
deep
belt
of
creeks
and
to
remove
them
to
the
meadows
which
had
no
need
of
protection
against
the
depredations
of
quadrumana
and
quadrapeds
on
the
15th
of
november
the
third
harvest
was
gathered
in
how
wonderfully
had
the
field
increased
in
extent
since
eighteen
months
ago
when
the
first
grain
of
wheat
was
sown
the
second
crop
of
six
hundred
thousand
grains
produced
this
time
four
thousand
bushels
or
five
hundred
millions
of
grains
the
colony
was
rich
in
corn
for
ten
bushels
alone
were
sufficient
for
sowing
every
year
to
produce
an
ample
crop
for
the
food
both
of
men
and
beasts
the
harvest
was
completed
and
the
last
fortnight
of
the
month
of
november
was
devoted
to
the
work
of
converting
it
into
food
for
man
in
fact
they
had
corn
but
not
flour
and
the
establishment
of
a
mill
was
necessary
cyrus
harding
could
have
utilized
the
second
fall
which
flowed
into
the
mercy
to
establish
his
motive
power
the
first
being
already
occupied
with
moving
the
felting
mill
but
after
some
consultation
it
was
decided
that
a
simple
windmill
should
be
built
on
prospect
heights
the
building
of
this
presented
no
more
difficulty
than
the
building
of
the
former
and
it
was
moreover
certain
that
there
would
be
no
want
of
wind
on
the
plateau
exposed
as
it
was
to
the
sea
breezes
not
to
mention
said
pencroft
that
the
windmill
will
be
more
lively
and
will
have
a
good
effect
in
the
landscape
they
set
to
work
by
choosing
timber
for
the
frame
and
machinery
of
the
mill
some
large
stones
found
at
the
north
of
the
lake
could
be
easily
transformed
into
millstones
and
as
to
the
sails
the
inexhaustible
case
of
the
balloon
furnished
the
necessary
material
cyrus
harding
made
his
model
and
the
site
of
the
mill
was
chosen
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
poultryyard
near
the
shore
of
the
lake
the
frame
was
to
rest
on
a
pivot
supported
with
strong
timbers
so
that
it
could
turn
with
all
the
machinery
it
contained
according
as
the
wind
required
it
the
work
advanced
rapidly
neb
and
pencroft
had
become
very
skilful
carpenters
and
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
copy
the
models
provided
by
the
engineer
soon
a
sort
of
cylindrical
box
in
shape
like
a
pepperpot
with
a
pointed
roof
rose
on
the
spot
chosen
the
four
frames
which
formed
the
sails
had
been
firmly
fixed
in
the
center
beam
so
as
to
form
a
certain
angle
with
it
and
secured
with
iron
clamps
as
to
the
different
parts
of
the
internal
mechanism
the
box
destined
to
contain
the
two
millstones
the
fixed
stone
and
the
moving
stone
the
hopper
a
sort
of
large
square
trough
wide
at
the
top
narrow
at
the
bottom
which
would
allow
the
grain
to
fall
on
the
stones
the
oscillating
spout
intended
to
regulate
the
passing
of
the
grain
and
lastly
the
bolting
machine
which
by
the
operation
of
sifting
separates
the
bran
from
the
flour
were
made
without
difficulty
the
tools
were
good
and
the
work
not
difficult
for
in
reality
the
machinery
of
a
mill
is
very
simple
this
was
only
a
question
of
time
every
one
had
worked
at
the
construction
of
the
mill
and
on
the
1st
of
december
it
was
finished
as
usual
pencroft
was
delighted
with
his
work
and
had
no
doubt
that
the
apparatus
was
perfect
now
for
a
good
wind
said
he
and
we
shall
grind
our
first
harvest
splendidly
a
good
wind
certainly
answered
the
engineer
but
not
too
much
pencroft
pooh
our
mill
would
only
go
the
faster
there
is
no
need
for
it
to
go
so
very
fast
replied
cyrus
harding
it
is
known
by
experience
that
the
greatest
quantity
of
work
is
performed
by
a
mill
when
the
number
of
turns
made
by
the
sails
in
a
minute
is
six
times
the
number
of
feet
traversed
by
the
wind
in
a
second
a
moderate
breeze
which
passes
over
twentyfour
feet
to
the
second
will
give
sixteen
turns
to
the
sails
during
a
minute
and
there
is
no
need
of
more
exactly
cried
herbert
a
fine
breeze
is
blowing
from
the
northeast
which
will
soon
do
our
business
for
us
there
was
no
reason
for
delaying
the
inauguration
of
the
mill
for
the
settlers
were
eager
to
taste
the
first
piece
of
bread
in
lincoln
island
on
this
morning
two
or
three
bushels
of
wheat
were
ground
and
the
next
day
at
breakfast
a
magnificent
loaf
a
little
heavy
perhaps
although
raised
with
yeast
appeared
on
the
table
at
granite
house
every
one
munched
away
at
it
with
a
pleasure
which
may
be
easily
understood
in
the
meanwhile
the
stranger
had
not
reappeared
several
times
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
searched
the
forest
in
the
neighborhood
of
granite
house
without
meeting
or
finding
any
trace
of
him
they
became
seriously
uneasy
at
this
prolonged
absence
certainly
the
former
savage
of
tabor
island
could
not
be
perplexed
how
to
live
in
the
forest
abounding
in
game
but
was
it
not
to
be
feared
that
he
had
resumed
his
habits
and
that
this
freedom
would
revive
in
him
his
wild
instincts
however
harding
by
a
sort
of
presentiment
doubtless
always
persisted
in
saying
that
the
fugitive
would
return
yes
he
will
return
he
repeated
with
a
confidence
which
his
companions
could
not
share
when
this
unfortunate
man
was
on
tabor
island
he
knew
himself
to
be
alone
here
he
knows
that
fellowmen
are
awaiting
him
since
he
has
partially
spoken
of
his
past
life
the
poor
penitent
will
return
to
tell
the
whole
and
from
that
day
he
will
belong
to
us
the
event
justified
cyrus
hardings
predictions
on
the
3rd
of
december
herbert
had
left
the
plateau
to
go
and
fish
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
lake
he
was
unarmed
and
till
then
had
never
taken
any
precautions
for
defense
as
dangerous
animals
had
not
shown
themselves
on
that
part
of
the
island
meanwhile
pencroft
and
neb
were
working
in
the
poultryyard
while
harding
and
the
reporter
were
occupied
at
the
chimneys
in
making
soda
the
store
of
soap
being
exhausted
suddenly
cries
resounded
help
help
cyrus
harding
and
the
reporter
being
at
too
great
a
distance
had
not
been
able
to
hear
the
shouts
pencroft
and
neb
leaving
the
poultryyard
in
all
haste
rushed
towards
the
lake
but
before
then
the
stranger
whose
presence
at
this
place
no
one
had
suspected
crossed
creek
glycerine
which
separated
the
plateau
from
the
forest
and
bounded
up
the
opposite
bank
herbert
was
there
face
to
face
with
a
fierce
jaguar
similar
to
the
one
which
had
been
killed
on
reptile
end
suddenly
surprised
he
was
standing
with
his
back
against
a
tree
while
the
animal
gathering
itself
together
was
about
to
spring
but
the
stranger
with
no
other
weapon
than
a
knife
rushed
on
the
formidable
animal
who
turned
to
meet
this
new
adversary
the
struggle
was
short
the
stranger
possessed
immense
strength
and
activity
he
seized
the
jaguars
throat
with
one
powerful
hand
holding
it
as
in
a
vise
without
heeding
the
beasts
claws
which
tore
his
flesh
and
with
the
other
he
plunged
his
knife
into
its
heart
the
jaguar
fell
the
stranger
kicked
away
the
body
and
was
about
to
fly
at
the
moment
when
the
settlers
arrived
on
the
field
of
battle
but
herbert
clinging
to
him
cried
no
no
you
shall
not
go
harding
advanced
towards
the
stranger
who
frowned
when
he
saw
him
approaching
the
blood
flowed
from
his
shoulder
under
his
torn
shirt
but
he
took
no
notice
of
it
my
friend
said
cyrus
harding
we
have
just
contracted
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
you
to
save
our
boy
you
have
risked
your
life
my
life
murmured
the
stranger
what
is
that
worth
less
than
nothing
you
are
wounded
it
is
no
matter
will
you
give
me
your
hand
and
as
herbert
endeavored
to
seize
the
hand
which
had
just
saved
him
the
stranger
folded
his
arms
his
chest
heaved
his
look
darkened
and
he
appeared
to
wish
to
escape
but
making
a
violent
effort
over
himself
and
in
an
abrupt
tone
who
are
you
he
asked
and
what
do
you
claim
to
be
to
me
it
was
the
colonists
history
which
he
thus
demanded
and
for
the
first
time
perhaps
this
history
recounted
he
would
tell
his
own
in
a
few
words
harding
related
all
that
had
happened
since
their
departure
from
richmond
how
they
had
managed
and
what
resources
they
now
had
at
their
disposal
the
stranger
listened
with
extreme
attention
then
the
engineer
told
who
they
all
were
gideon
spilett
herbert
pencroft
neb
himself
and
he
added
that
the
greatest
happiness
they
had
felt
since
their
arrival
in
lincoln
island
was
on
the
return
of
the
vessel
from
tabor
island
when
they
had
been
able
to
include
among
them
a
new
companion
at
these
words
the
strangers
face
flushed
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
and
confusion
was
depicted
on
his
countenance
and
now
that
you
know
us
added
cyrus
harding
will
you
give
us
your
hand
no
replied
the
stranger
in
a
hoarse
voice
no
you
are
honest
men
and
i
chapter
17
these
last
words
justified
the
colonists
presentiment
there
had
been
some
mournful
past
perhaps
expiated
in
the
sight
of
men
but
from
which
his
conscience
had
not
yet
absolved
him
at
any
rate
the
guilty
man
felt
remorse
he
repented
and
his
new
friends
would
have
cordially
pressed
the
hand
which
they
sought
but
he
did
not
feel
himself
worthy
to
extend
it
to
honest
men
however
after
the
scene
with
the
jaguar
he
did
not
return
to
the
forest
and
from
that
day
did
not
go
beyond
the
enclosure
of
granite
house
what
was
the
mystery
of
his
life
would
the
stranger
one
day
speak
of
it
time
alone
could
show
at
any
rate
it
was
agreed
that
his
secret
should
never
be
asked
from
him
and
that
they
would
live
with
him
as
if
they
suspected
nothing
for
some
days
their
life
continued
as
before
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
worked
together
sometimes
chemists
sometimes
experimentalists
the
reporter
never
left
the
engineer
except
to
hunt
with
herbert
for
it
would
not
have
been
prudent
to
allow
the
lad
to
ramble
alone
in
the
forest
and
it
was
very
necessary
to
be
on
their
guard
as
to
neb
and
pencroft
one
day
at
the
stables
and
poultryyard
another
at
the
corral
without
reckoning
work
in
granite
house
they
were
never
in
want
of
employment
the
stranger
worked
alone
and
he
had
resumed
his
usual
life
never
appearing
at
meals
sleeping
under
the
trees
in
the
plateau
never
mingling
with
his
companions
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
society
of
those
who
had
saved
him
was
insupportable
to
him
but
then
observed
pencroft
why
did
he
entreat
the
help
of
his
fellowcreatures
why
did
he
throw
that
paper
into
the
sea
he
will
tell
us
why
invariably
replied
cyrus
harding
when
perhaps
sooner
than
you
think
pencroft
and
indeed
the
day
of
confession
was
near
on
the
10th
of
december
a
week
after
his
return
to
granite
house
harding
saw
the
stranger
approaching
who
in
a
calm
voice
and
humble
tone
said
to
him
sir
i
have
a
request
to
make
of
you
speak
answered
the
engineer
but
first
let
me
ask
you
a
question
at
these
words
the
stranger
reddened
and
was
on
the
point
of
withdrawing
cyrus
harding
understood
what
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
the
guilty
man
who
doubtless
feared
that
the
engineer
would
interrogate
him
on
his
past
life
harding
held
him
back
comrade
said
he
we
are
not
only
your
companions
but
your
friends
i
wish
you
to
believe
that
and
now
i
will
listen
to
you
the
stranger
pressed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
he
was
seized
with
a
sort
of
trembling
and
remained
a
few
moments
without
being
able
to
articulate
a
word
sir
said
he
at
last
i
have
come
to
beg
you
to
grant
me
a
favor
what
is
it
you
have
four
or
five
miles
from
here
a
corral
for
your
domesticated
animals
these
animals
need
to
be
taken
care
of
will
you
allow
me
to
live
there
with
them
cyrus
harding
gazed
at
the
unfortunate
man
for
a
few
moments
with
a
feeling
of
deep
commiseration
then
my
friend
said
he
the
corral
has
only
stables
hardly
fit
for
animals
it
will
be
good
enough
for
me
sir
my
friend
answered
harding
we
will
not
constrain
you
in
anything
you
wish
to
live
at
the
corral
so
be
it
you
will
however
be
always
welcome
at
granite
house
but
since
you
wish
to
live
at
the
corral
we
will
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
your
being
comfortably
established
there
never
mind
that
i
shall
do
very
well
my
friend
answered
harding
who
always
intentionally
made
use
of
this
cordial
appellation
you
must
let
us
judge
what
it
will
be
best
to
do
in
this
respect
thank
you
sir
replied
the
stranger
as
he
withdrew
the
engineer
then
made
known
to
his
companions
the
proposal
which
had
been
made
to
him
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
build
a
wooden
house
at
the
corral
which
they
would
make
as
comfortable
as
possible
that
very
day
the
colonists
repaired
to
the
corral
with
the
necessary
tools
and
a
week
had
not
passed
before
the
house
was
ready
to
receive
its
tenant
it
was
built
about
twenty
feet
from
the
sheds
and
from
there
it
was
easy
to
overlook
the
flock
of
sheep
which
then
numbered
more
than
eighty
some
furniture
a
bed
table
bench
cupboard
and
chest
were
manufactured
and
a
gun
ammunition
and
tools
were
carried
to
the
corral
the
stranger
however
had
seen
nothing
of
his
new
dwelling
and
he
had
allowed
the
settlers
to
work
there
without
him
while
he
occupied
himself
on
the
plateau
wishing
doubtless
to
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
his
work
indeed
thanks
to
him
all
the
ground
was
dug
up
and
ready
to
be
sowed
when
the
time
came
it
was
on
the
20th
of
december
that
all
the
arrangements
at
the
corral
were
completed
the
engineer
announced
to
the
stranger
that
his
dwelling
was
ready
to
receive
him
and
the
latter
replied
that
he
would
go
and
sleep
there
that
very
evening
on
this
evening
the
colonists
were
gathered
in
the
diningroom
of
granite
house
it
was
then
eight
oclock
the
hour
at
which
their
companion
was
to
leave
them
not
wishing
to
trouble
him
by
their
presence
and
thus
imposing
on
him
the
necessity
of
saying
farewells
which
might
perhaps
be
painful
to
him
they
had
left
him
alone
and
ascended
to
granite
house
now
they
had
been
talking
in
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
when
a
light
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
almost
immediately
the
stranger
entered
and
without
any
preamble
gentlemen
said
he
before
i
leave
you
it
is
right
that
you
should
know
my
history
i
will
tell
it
you
these
simple
words
profoundly
impressed
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
the
engineer
rose
we
ask
you
nothing
my
friend
said
he
it
is
your
right
to
be
silent
it
is
my
duty
to
speak
sit
down
then
no
i
will
stand
we
are
ready
to
hear
you
replied
harding
the
stranger
remained
standing
in
a
corner
of
the
room
a
little
in
the
shade
he
was
bareheaded
his
arms
folded
across
his
chest
and
it
was
in
this
posture
that
in
a
hoarse
voice
speaking
like
some
one
who
obliges
himself
to
speak
he
gave
the
following
recital
which
his
auditors
did
not
once
interrupt
on
the
20th
of
december
1854
a
steamyacht
belonging
to
a
scotch
nobleman
lord
glenarvan
anchored
off
cape
bernouilli
on
the
western
coast
of
australia
in
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
on
board
this
yacht
were
lord
glenarvan
and
his
wife
a
major
in
the
english
army
a
french
geographer
a
young
girl
and
a
young
boy
these
two
last
were
the
children
of
captain
grant
whose
ship
the
britannia
had
been
lost
crew
and
cargo
a
year
before
the
duncan
was
commanded
by
captain
john
mangles
and
manned
by
a
crew
of
fifteen
men
this
is
the
reason
the
yacht
at
this
time
lay
off
the
coast
of
australia
six
months
before
a
bottle
enclosing
a
document
written
in
english
german
and
french
had
been
found
in
the
irish
sea
and
picked
up
by
the
duncan
this
document
stated
in
substance
that
there
still
existed
three
survivors
from
the
wreck
of
the
britannia
that
these
survivors
were
captain
grant
and
two
of
his
men
and
that
they
had
found
refuge
on
some
land
of
which
the
document
gave
the
latitude
but
of
which
the
longitude
effaced
by
the
sea
was
no
longer
legible
this
latitude
was
37deg
11
south
therefore
the
longitude
being
unknown
if
they
followed
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
over
continents
and
seas
they
would
be
certain
to
reach
the
spot
inhabited
by
captain
grant
and
his
two
companions
the
english
admiralty
having
hesitated
to
undertake
this
search
lord
glenarvan
resolved
to
attempt
everything
to
find
the
captain
he
communicated
with
mary
and
robert
grant
who
joined
him
the
duncan
yacht
was
equipped
for
the
distant
voyage
in
which
the
noblemans
family
and
the
captains
children
wished
to
take
part
and
the
duncan
leaving
glasgow
proceeded
towards
the
atlantic
passed
through
the
straits
of
magellan
and
ascended
the
pacific
as
far
as
patagonia
where
according
to
a
previous
interpretation
of
the
document
they
supposed
that
captain
grant
was
a
prisoner
among
the
indians
the
duncan
disembarked
her
passengers
on
the
western
coast
of
patagonia
and
sailed
to
pick
them
up
again
on
the
eastern
coast
at
cape
corrientes
lord
glenarvan
traversed
patagonia
following
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
and
having
found
no
trace
of
the
captain
he
reembarked
on
the
13th
of
november
so
as
to
pursue
his
search
through
the
ocean
after
having
unsuccessfully
visited
the
islands
of
tristan
dacunha
and
amsterdam
situated
in
her
course
the
duncan
as
i
have
said
arrived
at
cape
bernouilli
on
the
australian
coast
on
the
20th
of
december
1854
it
was
lord
glenarvans
intention
to
traverse
australia
as
he
had
traversed
america
and
he
disembarked
a
few
miles
from
the
coast
was
established
a
farm
belonging
to
an
irishman
who
offered
hospitality
to
the
travelers
lord
glenarvan
made
known
to
the
irishman
the
cause
which
had
brought
him
to
these
parts
and
asked
if
he
knew
whether
a
threemasted
english
vessel
the
britannia
had
been
lost
less
than
two
years
before
on
the
west
coast
of
australia
the
irishman
had
never
heard
of
this
wreck
but
to
the
great
surprise
of
the
bystanders
one
of
his
servants
came
forward
and
said
my
lord
praise
and
thank
god
if
captain
grant
is
still
living
he
is
living
on
the
australian
shores
who
are
you
asked
lord
glenarvan
a
scotchman
like
yourself
my
lord
replied
the
man
i
am
one
of
captain
grants
crewone
of
the
castaways
of
the
britannia
this
man
was
called
ayrton
he
was
in
fact
the
boatswains
mate
of
the
britannia
as
his
papers
showed
but
separated
from
captain
grant
at
the
moment
when
the
ship
struck
upon
the
rocks
he
had
till
then
believed
that
the
captain
with
all
his
crew
had
perished
and
that
he
ayrton
was
the
sole
survivor
of
the
britannia
only
he
added
it
was
not
on
the
west
coast
but
on
the
east
coast
of
australia
that
the
vessel
was
lost
and
if
captain
grant
is
still
living
as
his
document
indicates
he
is
a
prisoner
among
the
natives
and
it
is
on
the
other
coast
that
he
must
be
looked
for
this
man
spoke
in
a
frank
voice
and
with
a
confident
look
his
words
could
not
be
doubted
the
irishman
in
whose
service
he
had
been
for
more
than
a
year
answered
for
his
trustworthiness
lord
glenarvan
therefore
believed
in
the
fidelity
of
this
man
and
by
his
advice
resolved
to
cross
australia
following
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
lord
glenarvan
his
wife
the
two
children
the
major
the
frenchman
captain
mangles
and
a
few
sailors
composed
the
little
band
under
the
command
of
ayrton
while
the
duncan
under
charge
of
the
mate
tom
austin
proceeded
to
melbourne
there
to
await
lord
glenarvans
instructions
they
set
out
on
the
23rd
of
december
1854
it
is
time
to
say
that
ayrton
was
a
traitor
he
was
indeed
the
boatswains
mate
of
the
britannia
but
after
some
dispute
with
his
captain
he
endeavored
to
incite
the
crew
to
mutiny
and
seize
the
ship
and
captain
grant
had
landed
him
on
the
8th
of
april
1852
on
the
west
coast
of
australia
and
then
sailed
leaving
him
there
as
was
only
just
therefore
this
wretched
man
knew
nothing
of
the
wreck
of
the
britannia
he
had
just
heard
of
it
from
glenarvans
account
since
his
abandonment
he
had
become
under
the
name
of
ben
joyce
the
leader
of
the
escaped
convicts
and
if
he
boldly
maintained
that
the
wreck
had
taken
place
on
the
east
coast
and
led
lord
glenarvan
to
proceed
in
that
direction
it
was
that
he
hoped
to
separate
him
from
his
ship
seize
the
duncan
and
make
the
yacht
a
pirate
in
the
pacific
here
the
stranger
stopped
for
a
moment
his
voice
trembled
but
he
continued
the
expedition
set
out
and
proceeded
across
australia
it
was
inevitably
unfortunate
since
ayrton
or
ben
joyce
as
he
may
be
called
guided
it
sometimes
preceded
sometimes
followed
by
his
band
of
convicts
who
had
been
told
what
they
had
to
do
meanwhile
the
duncan
had
been
sent
to
melbourne
for
repairs
it
was
necessary
then
to
get
lord
glenarvan
to
order
her
to
leave
melbourne
and
go
to
the
east
coast
of
australia
where
it
would
be
easy
to
seize
her
after
having
led
the
expedition
near
enough
to
the
coast
in
the
midst
of
vast
forests
with
no
resources
ayrton
obtained
a
letter
which
he
was
charged
to
carry
to
the
mate
of
the
duncana
letter
which
ordered
the
yacht
to
repair
immediately
to
the
east
coast
to
twofold
bay
that
is
to
say
a
few
days
journey
from
the
place
where
the
expedition
had
stopped
it
was
there
that
ayrton
had
agreed
to
meet
his
accomplices
and
two
days
after
gaining
possession
of
the
letter
he
arrived
at
melbourne
so
far
the
villain
had
succeeded
in
his
wicked
design
he
would
be
able
to
take
the
duncan
into
twofold
bay
where
it
would
be
easy
for
the
convicts
to
seize
her
and
her
crew
massacred
ben
joyce
would
become
master
of
the
seas
but
it
pleased
god
to
prevent
the
accomplishment
of
these
terrible
projects
ayrton
arrived
at
melbourne
delivered
the
letter
to
the
mate
tom
austin
who
read
it
and
immediately
set
sail
but
judge
of
ayrtons
rage
and
disappointment
when
the
next
day
he
found
that
the
mate
was
taking
the
vessel
not
to
the
east
coast
of
australia
to
twofold
bay
but
to
the
east
coast
of
new
zealand
he
wished
to
stop
him
but
austin
showed
him
the
letter
and
indeed
by
a
providential
error
of
the
french
geographer
who
had
written
the
letter
the
east
coast
of
new
zealand
was
mentioned
as
the
place
of
destination
all
ayrtons
plans
were
frustrated
he
became
outrageous
they
put
him
in
irons
he
was
then
taken
to
the
coast
of
new
zealand
not
knowing
what
would
become
of
his
accomplices
or
what
would
become
of
lord
glenarvan
the
duncan
cruised
about
on
this
coast
until
the
3rd
of
march
on
that
day
ayrton
heard
the
report
of
guns
the
guns
on
the
duncan
were
being
fired
and
soon
lord
glenarvan
and
his
companions
came
on
board
this
is
what
had
happened
after
a
thousand
hardships
a
thousand
dangers
lord
glenarvan
had
accomplished
his
journey
and
arrived
on
the
east
coast
of
australia
at
twofold
bay
no
duncan
he
telegraphed
to
melbourne
they
answered
duncan
sailed
on
the
18th
instant
destination
unknown
lord
glenarvan
could
only
arrive
at
one
conclusion
that
his
honest
yacht
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
ben
joyce
and
had
become
a
pirate
vessel
however
lord
glenarvan
would
not
give
up
he
was
a
bold
and
generous
man
he
embarked
in
a
merchant
vessel
sailed
to
the
west
coast
of
new
zealand
traversed
it
along
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
without
finding
any
trace
of
captain
grant
but
on
the
other
side
to
his
great
surprise
and
by
the
will
of
heaven
he
found
the
duncan
under
command
of
the
mate
who
had
been
waiting
for
him
for
five
weeks
this
was
on
the
3rd
of
march
1855
lord
glenarvan
was
now
on
board
the
duncan
but
ayrton
was
there
also
he
appeared
before
the
nobleman
who
wished
to
extract
from
him
all
that
the
villain
knew
about
captain
grant
ayrton
refused
to
speak
lord
glenarvan
then
told
him
that
at
the
first
port
they
put
into
he
would
be
delivered
up
to
the
english
authorities
ayrton
remained
mute
the
duncan
continued
her
voyage
along
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
in
the
meanwhile
lady
glenarvan
undertook
to
vanquish
the
resistance
of
the
ruffian
at
last
her
influence
prevailed
and
ayrton
in
exchange
for
what
he
could
tell
proposed
that
lord
glenarvan
should
leave
him
on
some
island
in
the
pacific
instead
of
giving
him
up
to
the
english
authorities
lord
glenarvan
resolving
to
do
anything
to
obtain
information
about
captain
grant
consented
ayrton
then
related
all
his
life
and
it
was
certain
that
he
knew
nothing
from
the
day
on
which
captain
grant
had
landed
him
on
the
australian
coast
nevertheless
lord
glenarvan
kept
the
promise
which
he
had
given
the
duncan
continued
her
voyage
and
arrived
at
tabor
island
it
was
there
that
ayrton
was
to
be
landed
and
it
was
there
also
that
by
a
veritable
miracle
they
found
captain
grant
and
two
men
exactly
on
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
the
convict
then
went
to
take
their
place
on
this
desert
islet
and
at
the
moment
he
left
the
yacht
these
words
were
pronounced
by
lord
glenarvan
here
ayrton
you
will
be
far
from
any
land
and
without
any
possible
communication
with
your
fellowcreatures
you
cannot
escape
from
this
islet
on
which
the
duncan
leaves
you
you
will
be
alone
under
the
eye
of
a
god
who
reads
the
depths
of
the
heart
but
you
will
be
neither
lost
nor
forgotten
as
was
captain
grant
unworthy
as
you
are
to
be
remembered
by
men
men
will
remember
you
i
know
where
you
are
ayrton
and
i
know
where
to
find
you
i
will
never
forget
it
and
the
duncan
making
sail
soon
disappeared
this
was
18th
of
march
1855
the
events
which
have
just
been
briefly
related
are
taken
from
a
work
which
some
of
our
readers
have
no
doubt
read
and
which
is
entitled
captain
grants
children
they
will
remark
on
this
occasion
as
well
as
later
some
discrepancy
in
the
dates
but
later
again
they
will
understand
why
the
real
dates
were
not
at
first
given
ayrton
was
alone
but
he
had
no
want
of
either
ammunition
weapons
tools
or
seeds
at
his
the
convicts
disposal
was
the
house
built
by
honest
captain
grant
he
had
only
to
live
and
expiate
in
solitude
the
crimes
which
he
had
committed
gentlemen
he
repented
he
was
ashamed
of
his
crimes
and
was
very
miserable
he
said
to
himself
that
if
men
came
some
day
to
take
him
from
that
islet
he
must
be
worthy
to
return
among
them
how
he
suffered
that
wretched
man
how
he
labored
to
recover
himself
by
work
how
he
prayed
to
be
reformed
by
prayer
for
two
years
three
years
this
went
on
but
ayrton
humbled
by
solitude
always
looking
for
some
ship
to
appear
on
the
horizon
asking
himself
if
the
time
of
expiation
would
soon
be
complete
suffered
as
none
other
suffered
oh
how
dreadful
was
this
solitude
to
a
heart
tormented
by
remorse
but
doubtless
heaven
had
not
sufficiently
punished
this
unhappy
man
for
he
felt
that
he
was
gradually
becoming
a
savage
he
felt
that
brutishness
was
gradually
gaining
on
him
he
could
not
say
if
it
was
after
two
or
three
years
of
solitude
but
at
last
he
became
the
miserable
creature
you
found
i
have
no
need
to
tell
you
gentlemen
that
ayrton
ben
joyce
and
i
are
the
same
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
rose
at
the
end
of
this
account
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
much
they
were
moved
what
misery
grief
and
despair
lay
revealed
before
them
ayrton
said
harding
rising
you
have
been
a
great
criminal
but
heaven
must
certainly
think
that
you
have
expiated
your
crimes
that
has
been
proved
by
your
having
been
brought
again
among
your
fellowcreatures
ayrton
you
are
forgiven
and
now
you
will
be
our
companion
ayrton
drew
back
here
is
my
hand
said
the
engineer
ayrton
grasped
the
hand
which
harding
extended
to
him
and
great
tears
fell
from
his
eyes
will
you
live
with
us
asked
cyrus
harding
captain
harding
leave
me
some
time
longer
replied
ayrton
leave
me
alone
in
the
hut
in
the
corral
as
you
like
ayrton
answered
cyrus
harding
ayrton
was
going
to
withdraw
when
the
engineer
addressed
one
more
question
to
him
one
word
more
my
friend
since
it
was
your
intention
to
live
alone
why
did
you
throw
into
the
sea
the
document
which
put
us
on
your
track
a
document
repeated
ayrton
who
did
not
appear
to
know
what
he
meant
yes
the
document
which
we
found
enclosed
in
a
bottle
giving
us
the
exact
position
of
tabor
island
ayrton
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
then
after
having
thought
i
never
threw
any
document
into
the
sea
he
answered
never
exclaimed
pencroft
never
and
ayrton
bowing
reached
the
door
and
departed
chapter
18
poor
man
said
herbert
who
had
rushed
to
the
door
but
returned
having
seen
ayrton
slide
down
the
rope
on
the
lift
and
disappear
in
the
darkness
he
will
come
back
said
cyrus
harding
come
now
captain
exclaimed
pencroft
what
does
that
mean
what
wasnt
it
ayrton
who
threw
that
bottle
into
the
sea
who
was
it
then
certainly
if
ever
a
question
was
necessary
to
be
made
it
was
that
one
it
was
he
answered
neb
only
the
unhappy
man
was
halfmad
yes
said
herbert
and
he
was
no
longer
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
it
can
only
be
explained
in
that
way
my
friends
replied
harding
quickly
and
i
understand
now
how
ayrton
was
able
to
point
out
exactly
the
situation
of
tabor
island
since
the
events
which
had
preceded
his
being
left
on
the
island
had
made
it
known
to
him
however
observed
pencroft
if
he
was
not
yet
a
brute
when
he
wrote
that
document
and
if
he
threw
it
into
the
sea
seven
or
eight
years
ago
how
is
it
that
the
paper
has
not
been
injured
by
damp
that
proves
answered
cyrus
harding
that
ayrton
was
deprived
of
intelligence
at
a
more
recent
time
than
he
thinks
of
course
it
must
be
so
replied
pencroft
without
that
the
fact
would
be
unaccountable
unaccountable
indeed
answered
the
engineer
who
did
not
appear
desirous
to
prolong
the
conversation
but
has
ayrton
told
the
truth
asked
the
sailor
yes
replied
the
reporter
the
story
which
he
has
told
is
true
in
every
point
i
remember
quite
well
the
account
in
the
newspapers
of
the
yacht
expedition
undertaken
by
lord
glenarvan
and
its
result
ayrton
has
told
the
truth
added
harding
do
not
doubt
it
pencroft
for
it
was
painful
to
him
people
tell
the
truth
when
they
accuse
themselves
like
that
the
next
daythe
21st
of
decemberthe
colonists
descended
to
the
beach
and
having
climbed
the
plateau
they
found
nothing
of
ayrton
he
had
reached
his
house
in
the
corral
during
the
night
and
the
settlers
judged
it
best
not
to
agitate
him
by
their
presence
time
would
doubtless
perform
what
sympathy
had
been
unable
to
accomplish
herbert
pencroft
and
neb
resumed
their
ordinary
occupations
on
this
day
the
same
work
brought
harding
and
the
reporter
to
the
workshop
at
the
chimneys
do
you
know
my
dear
cyrus
said
gideon
spilett
that
the
explanation
you
gave
yesterday
on
the
subject
of
the
bottle
has
not
satisfied
me
at
all
how
can
it
be
supposed
that
the
unfortunate
man
was
able
to
write
that
document
and
throw
the
bottle
into
the
sea
without
having
the
slightest
recollection
of
it
nor
was
it
he
who
threw
it
in
my
dear
spilett
you
think
then
i
think
nothing
i
know
nothing
interrupted
cyrus
harding
i
am
content
to
rank
this
incident
among
those
which
i
have
not
been
able
to
explain
to
this
day
indeed
cyrus
said
spilett
these
things
are
incredible
your
rescue
the
case
stranded
on
the
sand
tops
adventure
and
lastly
this
bottle
shall
we
never
have
the
answer
to
these
enigmas
yes
replied
the
engineer
quickly
yes
even
if
i
have
to
penetrate
into
the
bowels
of
this
island
chance
will
perhaps
give
us
the
key
to
this
mystery
chance
spilett
i
do
not
believe
in
chance
any
more
than
i
believe
in
mysteries
in
this
world
there
is
a
reason
for
everything
unaccountable
which
has
happened
here
and
that
reason
i
shall
discover
but
in
the
meantime
we
must
work
and
observe
the
month
of
january
arrived
the
year
1867
commenced
the
summer
occupations
were
assiduously
continued
during
the
days
which
followed
herbert
and
spilett
having
gone
in
the
direction
of
the
corral
ascertained
that
ayrton
had
taken
possession
of
the
habitation
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
he
busied
himself
with
the
numerous
flock
confided
to
his
care
and
spared
his
companions
the
trouble
of
coming
every
two
or
three
days
to
visit
the
corral
nevertheless
in
order
not
to
leave
ayrton
in
solitude
for
too
long
a
time
the
settlers
often
paid
him
a
visit
it
was
not
unimportant
either
in
consequence
of
some
suspicions
entertained
by
the
engineer
and
gideon
spilett
that
this
part
of
the
island
should
be
subject
to
a
surveillance
of
some
sort
and
that
ayrton
if
any
incident
occurred
unexpectedly
should
not
neglect
to
inform
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
of
it
nevertheless
it
might
happen
that
something
would
occur
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
bring
rapidly
to
the
engineers
knowledge
independently
of
facts
bearing
on
the
mystery
of
lincoln
island
many
others
might
happen
which
would
call
for
the
prompt
interference
of
the
colonistssuch
as
the
sighting
of
a
vessel
a
wreck
on
the
western
coast
the
possible
arrival
of
pirates
etc
therefore
cyrus
harding
resolved
to
put
the
corral
in
instantaneous
communication
with
granite
house
it
was
on
the
10th
of
january
that
he
made
known
his
project
to
his
companions
why
how
are
you
going
to
manage
that
captain
asked
pencroft
do
you
by
chance
happen
to
think
of
establishing
a
telegraph
exactly
so
answered
the
engineer
electric
cried
herbert
electric
replied
cyrus
harding
we
have
all
the
necessary
materials
for
making
a
battery
and
the
most
difficult
thing
will
be
to
stretch
the
wires
but
by
means
of
a
drawplate
i
think
we
shall
manage
it
well
after
that
returned
the
sailor
i
shall
never
despair
of
seeing
ourselves
some
day
rolling
along
on
a
railway
they
then
set
to
work
beginning
with
the
most
difficult
thing
for
if
they
failed
in
that
it
would
be
useless
to
manufacture
the
battery
and
other
accessories
the
iron
of
lincoln
island
as
has
been
said
was
of
excellent
quality
and
consequently
very
fit
for
being
drawn
out
harding
commenced
by
manufacturing
a
drawplate
that
is
to
say
a
plate
of
steel
pierced
with
conical
holes
of
different
sizes
which
would
successively
bring
the
wire
to
the
wishedfor
tenacity
this
piece
of
steel
after
having
been
tempered
was
fixed
in
as
firm
a
way
as
possible
in
a
solid
framework
planted
in
the
ground
only
a
few
feet
from
the
great
fall
the
motive
power
of
which
the
engineer
intended
to
utilize
in
fact
as
the
fullingmill
was
there
although
not
then
in
use
its
beam
moved
with
extreme
power
would
serve
to
stretch
out
the
wire
by
rolling
it
round
itself
it
was
a
delicate
operation
and
required
much
care
the
iron
prepared
previously
in
long
thin
rods
the
ends
of
which
were
sharpened
with
the
file
having
been
introduced
into
the
largest
hole
of
the
drawplate
was
drawn
out
by
the
beam
which
wound
it
round
itself
to
a
length
of
twentyfive
or
thirty
feet
then
unrolled
and
the
same
operation
was
performed
successively
through
the
holes
of
a
less
size
finally
the
engineer
obtained
wires
from
forty
to
fifty
feet
long
which
could
be
easily
fastened
together
and
stretched
over
the
distance
of
five
miles
which
separated
the
corral
from
the
bounds
of
granite
house
it
did
not
take
more
than
a
few
days
to
perform
this
work
and
indeed
as
soon
as
the
machine
had
been
commenced
cyrus
harding
left
his
companions
to
follow
the
trade
of
wiredrawers
and
occupied
himself
with
manufacturing
his
battery
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
a
battery
with
a
constant
current
it
is
known
that
the
elements
of
modern
batteries
are
generally
composed
of
retort
coal
zinc
and
copper
copper
was
absolutely
wanting
to
the
engineer
who
notwithstanding
all
his
researches
had
never
been
able
to
find
any
trace
of
it
in
lincoln
island
and
was
therefore
obliged
to
do
without
it
retort
coal
that
is
to
say
the
hard
graphite
which
is
found
in
the
retorts
of
gas
manufactories
after
the
coal
has
been
dehydrogenized
could
have
been
obtained
but
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
establish
a
special
apparatus
involving
great
labor
as
to
zinc
it
may
be
remembered
that
the
case
found
at
flotsam
point
was
lined
with
this
metal
which
could
not
be
better
utilized
than
for
this
purpose
cyrus
harding
after
mature
consideration
decided
to
manufacture
a
very
simple
battery
resembling
as
nearly
as
possible
that
invented
by
becquerel
in
1820
and
in
which
zinc
only
is
employed
the
other
substances
azotic
acid
and
potash
were
all
at
his
disposal
the
way
in
which
the
battery
was
composed
was
as
follows
and
the
results
were
to
be
attained
by
the
reaction
of
acid
and
potash
on
each
other
a
number
of
glass
bottles
were
made
and
filled
with
azotic
acid
the
engineer
corked
them
by
means
of
a
stopper
through
which
passed
a
glass
tube
bored
at
its
lower
extremity
and
intended
to
be
plunged
into
the
acid
by
means
of
a
clay
stopper
secured
by
a
rag
into
this
tube
through
its
upper
extremity
he
poured
a
solution
of
potash
previously
obtained
by
burning
and
reducing
to
ashes
various
plants
and
in
this
way
the
acid
and
potash
could
act
on
each
other
through
the
clay
cyrus
harding
then
took
two
slips
of
zinc
one
of
which
was
plunged
into
azotic
acid
the
other
into
a
solution
of
potash
a
current
was
immediately
produced
which
was
transmitted
from
the
slip
of
zinc
in
the
bottle
to
that
in
the
tube
and
the
two
slips
having
been
connected
by
a
metallic
wire
the
slip
in
the
tube
became
the
positive
pole
and
that
in
the
bottle
the
negative
pole
of
the
apparatus
each
bottle
therefore
produced
as
many
currents
as
united
would
be
sufficient
to
produce
all
the
phenomena
of
the
electric
telegraph
such
was
the
ingenious
and
very
simple
apparatus
constructed
by
cyrus
harding
an
apparatus
which
would
allow
them
to
establish
a
telegraphic
communication
between
granite
house
and
the
corral
on
the
6th
of
february
was
commenced
the
planting
along
the
road
to
the
corral
of
posts
furnished
with
glass
insulators
and
intended
to
support
the
wire
a
few
days
after
the
wire
was
extended
ready
to
produce
the
electric
current
at
a
rate
of
twenty
thousand
miles
a
second
two
batteries
had
been
manufactured
one
for
granite
house
the
other
for
the
corral
for
if
it
was
necessary
the
corral
should
be
able
to
communicate
with
granite
house
it
might
also
be
useful
that
granite
house
should
be
able
to
communicate
with
the
corral
as
to
the
receiver
and
manipulator
they
were
very
simple
at
the
two
stations
the
wire
was
wound
round
a
magnet
that
is
to
say
round
a
piece
of
soft
iron
surrounded
with
a
wire
the
communication
was
thus
established
between
the
two
poles
the
current
starting
from
the
positive
pole
traversed
the
wire
passed
through
the
magnet
which
was
temporarily
magnetized
and
returned
through
the
earth
to
the
negative
pole
if
the
current
was
interrupted
the
magnet
immediately
became
unmagnetized
it
was
sufficient
to
place
a
plate
of
soft
iron
before
the
magnet
which
attracted
during
the
passage
of
the
current
would
fall
back
when
the
current
was
interrupted
this
movement
of
the
plate
thus
obtained
harding
could
easily
fasten
to
it
a
needle
arranged
on
a
dial
bearing
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
and
in
this
way
communicate
from
one
station
to
the
other
all
was
completely
arranged
by
the
12th
of
february
on
this
day
harding
having
sent
the
current
through
the
wire
asked
if
all
was
going
on
well
at
the
corral
and
received
in
a
few
moments
a
satisfactory
reply
from
ayrton
pencroft
was
wild
with
joy
and
every
morning
and
evening
he
sent
a
telegram
to
the
corral
which
always
received
an
answer
this
mode
of
communication
presented
two
very
real
advantages
firstly
because
it
enabled
them
to
ascertain
that
ayrton
was
at
the
corral
and
secondly
that
he
was
thus
not
left
completely
isolated
besides
cyrus
harding
never
allowed
a
week
to
pass
without
going
to
see
him
and
ayrton
came
from
time
to
time
to
granite
house
where
he
always
found
a
cordial
welcome
the
fine
season
passed
away
in
the
midst
of
the
usual
work
the
resources
of
the
colony
particularly
in
vegetables
and
corn
increased
from
day
to
day
and
the
plants
brought
from
tabor
island
had
succeeded
perfectly
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
presented
an
encouraging
aspect
the
fourth
harvest
had
been
admirable
and
it
may
be
supposed
that
no
one
thought
of
counting
whether
the
four
hundred
thousand
millions
of
grains
duly
appeared
in
the
crop
however
pencroft
had
thought
of
doing
so
but
cyrus
harding
having
told
him
that
even
if
he
managed
to
count
three
hundred
grains
a
minute
or
nine
thousand
an
hour
it
would
take
him
nearly
five
thousand
fivehundred
years
to
finish
his
task
the
honest
sailor
considered
it
best
to
give
up
the
idea
the
weather
was
splendid
the
temperature
very
warm
in
the
day
time
but
in
the
evening
the
seabreezes
tempered
the
heat
of
the
atmosphere
and
procured
cool
nights
for
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
there
were
however
a
few
storms
which
although
they
were
not
of
long
duration
swept
over
lincoln
island
with
extraordinary
fury
the
lightning
blazed
and
the
thunder
continued
to
roll
for
some
hours
at
this
period
the
little
colony
was
extremely
prosperous
the
tenants
of
the
poultryyard
swarmed
and
they
lived
on
the
surplus
but
it
became
necessary
to
reduce
the
population
to
a
more
moderate
number
the
pigs
had
already
produced
young
and
it
may
be
understood
that
their
care
for
these
animals
absorbed
a
great
part
of
neb
and
pencrofts
time
the
onagers
who
had
two
pretty
colts
were
most
often
mounted
by
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
who
had
become
an
excellent
rider
under
the
reporters
instruction
and
they
also
harnessed
them
to
the
cart
either
for
carrying
wood
and
coal
to
granite
house
or
different
mineral
productions
required
by
the
engineer
several
expeditions
were
made
about
this
time
into
the
depths
of
the
far
west
forests
the
explorers
could
venture
there
without
having
anything
to
fear
from
the
heat
for
the
suns
rays
scarcely
penetrated
through
the
thick
foliage
spreading
above
their
heads
they
thus
visited
all
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
along
which
ran
the
road
from
the
corral
to
the
mouth
of
falls
river
but
in
these
excursions
the
settlers
took
care
to
be
well
armed
for
they
met
with
savage
wild
boars
with
which
they
often
had
a
tussle
they
also
during
this
season
made
fierce
war
against
the
jaguars
gideon
spilett
had
vowed
a
special
hatred
against
them
and
his
pupil
herbert
seconded
him
well
armed
as
they
were
they
no
longer
feared
to
meet
one
of
those
beasts
herberts
courage
was
superb
and
the
reporters
sangfroid
astonishing
already
twenty
magnificent
skins
ornamented
the
diningroom
of
granite
house
and
if
this
continued
the
jaguar
race
would
soon
be
extinct
in
the
island
the
object
aimed
at
by
the
hunters
the
engineer
sometimes
took
part
in
the
expeditions
made
to
the
unknown
parts
of
the
island
which
he
surveyed
with
great
attention
it
was
for
other
traces
than
those
of
animals
that
he
searched
the
thickets
of
the
vast
forest
but
nothing
suspicious
ever
appeared
neither
top
nor
jup
who
accompanied
him
ever
betrayed
by
their
behavior
that
there
was
anything
strange
there
and
yet
more
than
once
again
the
dog
barked
at
the
mouth
of
the
well
which
the
engineer
had
before
explored
without
result
at
this
time
gideon
spilett
aided
by
herbert
took
several
views
of
the
most
picturesque
parts
of
the
island
by
means
of
the
photographic
apparatus
found
in
the
cases
and
of
which
they
had
not
as
yet
made
any
use
this
apparatus
provided
with
a
powerful
objectglass
was
very
complete
substances
necessary
for
the
photographic
reproduction

for
preparing
the
glass

nitrate
of
silver
to
render
it
sensitive

to
fix
the

obtained
chloride
of
ammonium
in
which
to
soak
the
paper
destined
to
give
the
positive
proof
acetate
of
soda
and
chloride
of
gold
in
which
to
immerse
the
paper
nothing
was
wanting
even
the
papers
were
there
all
prepared
and
before
laying
in
the
printingframe
upon
the
negatives
it
was
sufficient
to
soak
them
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
solution
of
nitrate
of
silver
the
reporter
and
his
assistant
became
in
a
short
time
very
skilful
operators
and
they
obtained
fine
views
of
the
country
such
as
the
island
taken
from
prospect
heights
with
mount
franklin
in
the
distance
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
so
picturesquely
framed
in
high
rocks
the
glade
and
the
corral
with
the
spurs
of
the
mountain
in
the
background
the
curious
development
of
claw
cape
flotsam
point
etc
nor
did
the
photographers
forget
to
take
the
portraits
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
leaving
out
no
one
it
multiplies
us
said
pencroft
and
the
sailor
was
enchanted
to
see
his
own
countenance
faithfully
reproduced
ornamenting
the
walls
of
granite
house
and
he
stopped
as
willingly
before
this
exhibition
as
he
would
have
done
before
the
richest
shopwindows
in
broadway
but
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
most
successful
portrait
was
incontestably
that
of
master
jup
master
jup
had
sat
with
a
gravity
not
to
be
described
and
his
portrait
was
lifelike
he
looks
as
if
he
was
just
going
to
grin
exclaimed
pencroft
and
if
master
jup
had
not
been
satisfied
he
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
please
but
he
was
quite
contented
and
contemplated
his
own
countenance
with
a
sentimental
air
which
expressed
some
small
amount
of
conceit
the
summer
heat
ended
with
the
month
of
march
the
weather
was
sometimes
rainy
but
still
warm
the
month
of
march
which
corresponds
to
the
september
of
northern
latitudes
was
not
so
fine
as
might
have
been
hoped
perhaps
it
announced
an
early
and
rigorous
winter
it
might
have
been
supposed
one
morningthe
21
stthat
the
first
snow
had
already
made
its
appearance
in
fact
herbert
looking
early
from
one
of
the
windows
of
granite
house
exclaimed
hallo
the
islet
is
covered
with
snow
snow
at
this
time
answered
the
reporter
joining
the
boy
their
companions
were
soon
beside
them
but
could
only
ascertain
one
thing
that
not
only
the
islet
but
all
the
beach
below
granite
house
was
covered
with
one
uniform
sheet
of
white
it
must
be
snow
said
pencroft
or
rather
its
very
like
it
replied
neb
but
the
thermometer
marks
fiftyeight
degrees
observed
gideon
spilett
cyrus
harding
gazed
at
the
sheet
of
white
without
saying
anything
for
he
really
did
not
know
how
to
explain
this
phenomenon
at
this
time
of
year
and
in
such
a
temperature
by
jove
exclaimed
pencroft
all
our
plants
will
be
frozen
and
the
sailor
was
about
to
descend
when
he
was
preceded
by
the
nimble
jup
who
slid
down
to
the
sand
but
the
orang
had
not
touched
the
ground
when
the
snowy
sheet
arose
and
dispersed
in
the
air
in
such
innumerable
flakes
that
the
light
of
the
sun
was
obscured
for
some
minutes
birds
cried
herbert
they
were
indeed
swarms
of
seabirds
with
dazzling
white
plumage
they
had
perched
by
thousands
on
the
islet
and
on
the
shore
and
they
disappeared
in
the
distance
leaving
the
colonists
amazed
as
if
they
had
been
present
at
some
transformation
scene
in
which
summer
succeeded
winter
at
the
touch
of
a
fairys
wand
unfortunately
the
change
had
been
so
sudden
that
neither
the
reporter
nor
the
lad
had
been
able
to
bring
down
one
of
these
birds
of
which
they
could
not
recognize
the
species
a
few
days
after
came
the
26th
of
march
the
day
on
which
two
years
before
the
castaways
from
the
air
had
been
thrown
upon
lincoln
island
chapter
19
two
years
already
and
for
two
years
the
colonists
had
had
no
communication
with
their
fellowcreatures
they
were
without
news
from
the
civilized
world
lost
on
this
island
as
completely
as
if
they
had
been
on
the
most
minute
star
of
the
celestial
hemisphere
what
was
now
happening
in
their
country
the
picture
of
their
native
land
was
always
before
their
eyes
the
land
torn
by
civil
war
at
the
time
they
left
it
and
which
the
southern
rebellion
was
perhaps
still
staining
with
blood
it
was
a
great
sorrow
to
them
and
they
often
talked
together
of
these
things
without
ever
doubting
however
that
the
cause
of
the
north
must
triumph
for
the
honor
of
the
american
confederation
during
these
two
years
not
a
vessel
had
passed
in
sight
of
the
island
or
at
least
not
a
sail
had
been
seen
it
was
evident
that
lincoln
island
was
out
of
the
usual
track
and
also
that
it
was
unknownas
was
besides
proved
by
the
mapsfor
though
there
was
no
port
vessels
might
have
visited
it
for
the
purpose
of
renewing
their
store
of
water
but
the
surrounding
ocean
was
deserted
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
the
colonists
must
rely
on
themselves
for
regaining
their
native
land
however
one
chance
of
rescue
existed
and
this
chance
was
discussed
one
day
on
the
first
week
of
april
when
the
colonists
were
gathered
together
in
the
diningroom
of
granite
house
they
had
been
talking
of
america
of
their
native
country
which
they
had
so
little
hope
of
ever
seeing
again
decidedly
we
have
only
one
way
said
spilett
one
single
way
for
leaving
lincoln
island
and
that
is
to
build
a
vessel
large
enough
to
sail
several
hundred
miles
it
appears
to
me
that
when
one
has
built
a
boat
it
is
just
as
easy
to
build
a
ship
and
in
which
we
might
go
to
the
pomoutous
added
herbert
just
as
easily
as
we
went
to
tabor
island
i
do
not
say
no
replied
pencroft
who
had
always
the
casting
vote
in
maritime
questions
i
do
not
say
no
although
it
is
not
exactly
the
same
thing
to
make
a
long
as
a
short
voyage
if
our
little
craft
had
been
caught
in
any
heavy
gale
of
wind
during
the
voyage
to
tabor
island
we
should
have
known
that
land
was
at
no
great
distance
either
way
but
twelve
hundred
miles
is
a
pretty
long
way
and
the
nearest
land
is
at
least
that
distance
would
you
not
in
that
case
pencroft
attempt
the
adventure
asked
the
reporter
i
will
attempt
anything
that
is
desired
mr
spilett
answered
the
sailor
and
you
know
well
that
i
am
not
a
man
to
flinch
remember
besides
that
we
number
another
sailor
amongst
us
now
remarked
neb
who
is
that
asked
pencroft
ayrton
if
he
will
consent
to
come
said
pencroft
nonsense
returned
the
reporter
do
you
think
that
if
lord
glenarvans
yacht
had
appeared
at
tabor
island
while
he
was
still
living
there
ayrton
would
have
refused
to
depart
you
forget
my
friends
then
said
cyrus
harding
that
ayrton
was
not
in
possession
of
his
reason
during
the
last
years
of
his
stay
there
but
that
is
not
the
question
the
point
is
to
know
if
we
may
count
among
our
chances
of
being
rescued
the
return
of
the
scotch
vessel
now
lord
glenarvan
promised
ayrton
that
he
would
return
to
take
him
off
from
tabor
island
when
he
considered
that
his
crimes
were
expiated
and
i
believe
that
he
will
return
yes
said
the
reporter
and
i
will
add
that
he
will
return
soon
for
it
is
twelve
years
since
ayrton
was
abandoned
well
answered
pencroft
i
agree
with
you
that
the
nobleman
will
return
and
soon
too
but
where
will
he
touch
at
tabor
island
and
not
at
lincoln
island
that
is
the
more
certain
replied
herbert
as
lincoln
island
is
not
even
marked
on
the
map
therefore
my
friends
said
the
engineer
we
ought
to
take
the
necessary
precautions
for
making
our
presence
and
that
of
ayrton
on
lincoln
island
known
at
tabor
island
certainly
answered
the
reporter
and
nothing
is
easier
than
to
place
in
the
hut
which
was
captain
grants
and
ayrtons
dwelling
a
notice
which
lord
glenarvan
and
his
crew
cannot
help
finding
giving
the
position
of
our
island
it
is
a
pity
remarked
the
sailor
that
we
forgot
to
take
that
precaution
on
our
first
visit
to
tabor
island
and
why
should
we
have
done
it
asked
herbert
at
that
time
we
did
not
know
ayrtons
history
we
did
not
know
that
any
one
was
likely
to
come
some
day
to
fetch
him
and
when
we
did
know
his
history
the
season
was
too
advanced
to
allow
us
to
return
then
to
tabor
island
yes
replied
harding
it
was
too
late
and
we
must
put
off
the
voyage
until
next
spring
but
suppose
the
scotch
yacht
comes
before
that
said
pencroft
that
is
not
probable
replied
the
engineer
for
lord
glenarvan
would
not
choose
the
winter
season
to
venture
into
these
seas
either
he
has
already
returned
to
tabor
island
since
ayrton
has
been
with
us
that
is
to
say
during
the
last
five
months
and
has
left
again
or
he
will
not
come
till
later
and
it
will
be
time
enough
in
the
first
fine
october
days
to
go
to
tabor
island
and
leave
a
notice
there
we
must
allow
said
neb
that
it
will
be
very
unfortunate
if
the
duncan
has
returned
to
these
parts
only
a
few
months
ago
i
hope
that
it
is
not
so
replied
cyrus
harding
and
that
heaven
has
not
deprived
us
of
the
best
chance
which
remains
to
us
i
think
observed
the
reporter
that
at
any
rate
we
shall
know
what
we
have
to
depend
on
when
we
have
been
to
tabor
island
for
if
the
yacht
has
returned
there
they
will
necessarily
have
left
some
traces
of
their
visit
that
is
evident
answered
the
engineer
so
then
my
friends
since
we
have
this
chance
of
returning
to
our
country
we
must
wait
patiently
and
if
it
is
taken
from
us
we
shall
see
what
will
be
best
to
do
at
any
rate
remarked
pencroft
it
is
well
understood
that
if
we
do
leave
lincoln
island
it
will
not
be
because
we
were
uncomfortable
there
no
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
it
will
be
because
we
are
far
from
all
that
a
man
holds
dearest
in
the
world
his
family
his
friends
his
native
land
matters
being
thus
decided
the
building
of
a
vessel
large
enough
to
sail
either
to
the
archipelagoes
in
the
north
or
to
new
zealand
in
the
west
was
no
longer
talked
of
and
they
busied
themselves
in
their
accustomed
occupations
with
a
view
to
wintering
a
third
time
in
granite
house
however
it
was
agreed
that
before
the
stormy
weather
came
on
their
little
vessel
should
be
employed
in
making
a
voyage
round
the
island
a
complete
survey
of
the
coast
had
not
yet
been
made
and
the
colonists
had
but
an
imperfect
idea
of
the
shore
to
the
west
and
north
from
the
mouth
of
falls
river
to
the
mandible
capes
as
well
as
of
the
narrow
bay
between
them
which
opened
like
a
sharks
jaws
the
plan
of
this
excursion
was
proposed
by
pencroft
and
cyrus
harding
fully
acquiesced
in
it
for
he
himself
wished
to
see
this
part
of
his
domain
the
weather
was
variable
but
the
barometer
did
not
fluctuate
by
sudden
movements
and
they
could
therefore
count
on
tolerable
weather
however
during
the
first
week
of
april
after
a
sudden
barometrical
fall
a
renewed
rise
was
marked
by
a
heavy
gale
of
wind
lasting
five
or
six
days
then
the
needle
of
the
instrument
remained
stationary
at
a
height
of
twentynine
inches
and
ninetenths
and
the
weather
appeared
propitious
for
an
excursion
the
departure
was
fixed
for
the
16th
of
april
and
the
bonadventure
anchored
in
port
balloon
was
provisioned
for
a
voyage
which
might
be
of
some
duration
cyrus
harding
informed
ayrton
of
the
projected
expedition
and
proposed
that
he
should
take
part
in
it
but
ayrton
preferring
to
remain
on
shore
it
was
decided
that
he
should
come
to
granite
house
during
the
absence
of
his
companions
master
jup
was
ordered
to
keep
him
company
and
made
no
remonstrance
on
the
morning
of
the
16th
of
april
all
the
colonists
including
top
embarked
a
fine
breeze
blew
from
the
southwest
and
the
bonadventure
tacked
on
leaving
port
balloon
so
as
to
reach
reptile
end
of
the
ninety
miles
which
the
perimeter
of
the
island
measured
twenty
included
the
south
coast
between
the
port
and
the
promontory
the
wind
being
right
ahead
it
was
necessary
to
hug
the
shore
it
took
the
whole
day
to
reach
the
promontory
for
the
vessel
on
leaving
port
had
only
two
hours
of
ebb
tide
and
had
therefore
to
make
way
for
six
hours
against
the
flood
it
was
nightfall
before
the
promontory
was
doubled
the
sailor
then
proposed
to
the
engineer
that
they
should
continue
sailing
slowly
with
two
reefs
in
the
sail
but
harding
preferred
to
anchor
a
few
cablelengths
from
the
shore
so
as
to
survey
that
part
of
the
coast
during
the
day
it
was
agreed
also
that
as
they
were
anxious
for
a
minute
exploration
of
the
coast
they
should
not
sail
during
the
night
but
would
always
when
the
weather
permitted
it
be
at
anchor
near
the
shore
the
night
was
passed
under
the
promontory
and
the
wind
having
fallen
nothing
disturbed
the
silence
the
passengers
with
the
exception
of
the
sailor
scarcely
slept
as
well
on
board
the
bonadventure
as
they
would
have
done
in
their
rooms
at
granite
house
but
they
did
sleep
however
pencroft
set
sail
at
break
of
day
and
by
going
on
the
larboard
tack
they
could
keep
close
to
the
shore
the
colonists
knew
this
beautiful
wooded
coast
since
they
had
already
explored
it
on
foot
and
yet
it
again
excited
their
admiration
they
coasted
along
as
close
in
as
possible
so
as
to
notice
everything
avoiding
always
the
trunks
of
trees
which
floated
here
and
there
several
times
also
they
anchored
and
gideon
spilett
took
photographs
of
the
superb
scenery
about
noon
the
bonadventure
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
falls
river
beyond
on
the
left
bank
a
few
scattered
trees
appeared
and
three
miles
further
even
these
dwindled
into
solitary
groups
among
the
western
spurs
of
the
mountain
whose
arid
ridge
sloped
down
to
the
shore
what
a
contrast
between
the
northern
and
southern
part
of
the
coast
in
proportion
as
one
was
woody
and
fertile
so
was
the
other
rugged
and
barren
it
might
have
been
designated
as
one
of
those
iron
coasts
as
they
are
called
in
some
countries
and
its
wild
confusion
appeared
to
indicate
that
a
sudden
crystallization
had
been
produced
in
the
yet
liquid
basalt
of
some
distant
geological
sea
these
stupendous
masses
would
have
terrified
the
settlers
if
they
had
been
cast
at
first
on
this
part
of
the
island
they
had
not
been
able
to
perceive
the
sinister
aspect
of
this
shore
from
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
for
they
overlooked
it
from
too
great
a
height
but
viewed
from
the
sea
it
presented
a
wild
appearance
which
could
not
perhaps
be
equaled
in
any
corner
of
the
globe
the
bonadventure
sailed
along
this
coast
for
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
it
was
easy
to
see
that
it
was
composed
of
blocks
of
all
sizes
from
twenty
to
three
hundred
feet
in
height
and
of
all
shapes
round
like
towers
prismatic
like
steeples
pyramidal
like
obelisks
conical
like
factory
chimneys
an
iceberg
of
the
polar
seas
could
not
have
been
more
capricious
in
its
terrible
sublimity
here
bridges
were
thrown
from
one
rock
to
another
there
arches
like
those
of
a
wave
into
the
depths
of
which
the
eye
could
not
penetrate
in
one
place
large
vaulted
excavations
presented
a
monumental
aspect
in
another
a
crowd
of
columns
spires
and
arches
such
as
no
gothic
cathedral
ever
possessed
every
caprice
of
nature
still
more
varied
than
those
of
the
imagination
appeared
on
this
grand
coast
which
extended
over
a
length
of
eight
or
nine
miles
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
gazed
with
a
feeling
of
surprise
bordering
on
stupefaction
but
although
they
remained
silent
top
not
being
troubled
with
feelings
of
this
sort
uttered
barks
which
were
repeated
by
the
thousand
echoes
of
the
basaltic
cliff
the
engineer
even
observed
that
these
barks
had
something
strange
in
them
like
those
which
the
dog
had
uttered
at
the
mouth
of
the
well
in
granite
house
let
us
go
close
in
said
he
and
the
bonadventure
sailed
as
near
as
possible
to
the
rocky
shore
perhaps
some
cave
which
it
would
be
advisable
to
explore
existed
there
but
harding
saw
nothing
not
a
cavern
not
a
cleft
which
could
serve
as
a
retreat
to
any
being
whatever
for
the
foot
of
the
cliff
was
washed
by
the
surf
soon
tops
barks
ceased
and
the
vessel
continued
her
course
at
a
few
cableslength
from
the
coast
in
the
northwest
part
of
the
island
the
shore
became
again
flat
and
sandy
a
few
trees
here
and
there
rose
above
a
low
marshy
ground
which
the
colonists
had
already
surveyed
and
in
violent
contrast
to
the
other
desert
shore
life
was
again
manifested
by
the
presence
of
myriads
of
waterfowl
that
evening
the
bonadventure
anchored
in
a
small
bay
to
the
north
of
the
island
near
the
land
such
was
the
depth
of
water
there
the
night
passed
quietly
for
the
breeze
died
away
with
the
last
light
of
day
and
only
rose
again
with
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
as
it
was
easy
to
land
the
usual
hunters
of
the
colony
that
is
to
say
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
went
for
a
ramble
of
two
hours
or
so
and
returned
with
several
strings
of
wild
duck
and
snipe
top
had
done
wonders
and
not
a
bird
had
been
lost
thanks
to
his
zeal
and
cleverness
at
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
the
bonadventure
set
sail
and
ran
rapidly
towards
north
mandible
cape
for
the
wind
was
right
astern
and
freshening
rapidly
however
observed
pencroft
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
a
gale
came
up
from
the
west
yesterday
the
sun
set
in
a
very
redlooking
horizon
and
now
this
morning
those
marestails
dont
forbode
anything
good
these
marestails
are
cirrus
clouds
scattered
in
the
zenith
their
height
from
the
sea
being
less
than
five
thousand
feet
they
look
like
light
pieces
of
cotton
wool
and
their
presence
usually
announces
some
sudden
change
in
the
weather
well
said
harding
let
us
carry
as
much
sail
as
possible
and
run
for
shelter
into
shark
gulf
i
think
that
the
bonadventure
will
be
safe
there
perfectly
replied
pencroft
and
besides
the
north
coast
is
merely
sand
very
uninteresting
to
look
at
i
shall
not
be
sorry
resumed
the
engineer
to
pass
not
only
tonight
but
tomorrow
in
that
bay
which
is
worth
being
carefully
explored
i
think
that
we
shall
be
obliged
to
do
so
whether
we
like
it
or
not
answered
pencroft
for
the
sky
looks
very
threatening
towards
the
west
dirty
weather
is
coming
on
at
any
rate
we
have
a
favorable
wind
for
reaching
cape
mandible
observed
the
reporter
a
very
fine
wind
replied
the
sailor
but
we
must
tack
to
enter
the
gulf
and
i
should
like
to
see
my
way
clear
in
these
unknown
quarters
quarters
which
appear
to
be
filled
with
rocks
added
herbert
if
we
judge
by
what
we
saw
on
the
south
coast
of
shark
gulf
pencroft
said
cyrus
harding
do
as
you
think
best
we
will
leave
it
to
you
dont
make
your
mind
uneasy
captain
replied
the
sailor
i
shall
not
expose
myself
needlessly
i
would
rather
a
knife
were
run
into
my
ribs
than
a
sharp
rock
into
those
of
my
bonadventure
that
which
pencroft
called
ribs
was
the
part
of
his
vessel
under
water
and
he
valued
it
more
than
his
own
skin
what
oclock
is
it
asked
pencroft
ten
oclock
replied
gideon
spilett
and
what
distance
is
it
to
the
cape
captain
about
fifteen
miles
replied
the
engineer
thats
a
matter
of
two
hours
and
a
half
said
the
sailor
and
we
shall
be
off
the
cape
between
twelve
and
one
oclock
unluckily
the
tide
will
be
turning
at
that
moment
and
will
be
ebbing
out
of
the
gulf
i
am
afraid
that
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
get
in
having
both
wind
and
tide
against
us
and
the
more
so
that
it
is
a
full
moon
today
remarked
herbert
and
these
april
tides
are
very
strong
well
pencroft
asked
harding
can
you
not
anchor
off
the
cape
anchor
near
land
with
bad
weather
coming
on
exclaimed
the
sailor
what
are
you
thinking
of
captain
we
should
run
aground
of
a
certainty
what
will
you
do
then
i
shall
try
to
keep
in
the
offing
until
the
flood
that
is
to
say
till
about
seven
in
the
evening
and
if
there
is
still
light
enough
i
will
try
to
enter
the
gulf
if
not
we
must
stand
off
and
on
during
the
night
and
we
will
enter
tomorrow
at
sunrise
as
i
told
you
pencroft
we
will
leave
it
to
you
answered
harding
ah
said
pencroft
if
there
was
only
a
lighthouse
on
the
coast
it
would
be
much
more
convenient
for
sailors
yes
replied
herbert
and
this
time
we
shall
have
no
obliging
engineer
to
light
a
fire
to
guide
us
into
port
why
indeed
my
dear
cyrus
said
spilett
we
have
never
thanked
you
but
frankly
without
that
fire
we
should
never
have
been
able
a
fire
asked
harding
much
astonished
at
the
reporters
words
we
mean
captain
answered
pencroft
that
on
board
the
bonadventure
we
were
very
anxious
during
the
few
hours
before
our
return
and
we
should
have
passed
to
windward
of
the
island
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
precaution
you
took
of
lighting
a
fire
the
night
of
the
19th
of
october
on
prospect
heights
yes
yes
that
was
a
lucky
idea
of
mine
replied
the
engineer
and
this
time
continued
the
sailor
unless
the
idea
occurs
to
ayrton
there
will
be
no
one
to
do
us
that
little
service
no
no
one
answered
cyrus
harding
a
few
minutes
after
finding
himself
alone
in
the
bows
of
the
vessel
with
the
reporter
the
engineer
bent
down
and
whispered
if
there
is
one
thing
certain
in
this
world
spilett
it
is
that
i
never
lighted
any
fire
during
the
night
of
the
19th
of
october
neither
on
prospect
heights
nor
on
any
other
part
of
the
island
chapter
20
things
happened
as
pencroft
had
predicted
he
being
seldom
mistaken
in
his
prognostications
the
wind
rose
and
from
a
fresh
breeze
it
soon
increased
to
a
regular
gale
that
is
to
say
it
acquired
a
speed
of
from
forty
to
fortyfive
miles
an
hour
before
which
a
ship
in
the
open
sea
would
have
run
under
closereefed
topsails
now
as
it
was
nearly
six
oclock
when
the
bonadventure
reached
the
gulf
and
as
at
that
moment
the
tide
turned
it
was
impossible
to
enter
they
were
therefore
compelled
to
stand
off
for
even
if
he
had
wished
to
do
so
pencroft
could
not
have
gained
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
hoisting
the
jib
to
the
mainmast
by
way
of
a
stormsail
he
hove
to
putting
the
head
of
the
vessel
towards
the
land
fortunately
although
the
wind
was
strong
the
sea
being
sheltered
by
the
land
did
not
run
very
high
they
had
then
little
to
fear
from
the
waves
which
always
endanger
small
craft
the
bonadventure
would
doubtlessly
not
have
capsized
for
she
was
well
ballasted
but
enormous
masses
of
water
falling
on
the
deck
might
injure
her
if
her
timbers
could
not
sustain
them
pencroft
as
a
good
sailor
was
prepared
for
anything
certainly
he
had
great
confidence
in
his
vessel
but
nevertheless
he
awaited
the
return
of
day
with
some
anxiety
during
the
night
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
had
no
opportunity
for
talking
together
and
yet
the
words
pronounced
in
the
reporters
ear
by
the
engineer
were
well
worth
being
discussed
together
with
the
mysterious
influence
which
appeared
to
reign
over
lincoln
island
gideon
spilett
did
not
cease
from
pondering
over
this
new
and
inexplicable
incident
the
appearance
of
a
fire
on
the
coast
of
the
island
the
fire
had
actually
been
seen
his
companions
herbert
and
pencroft
had
seen
it
with
him
the
fire
had
served
to
signalize
the
position
of
the
island
during
that
dark
night
and
they
had
not
doubted
that
it
was
lighted
by
the
engineers
hand
and
here
was
cyrus
harding
expressly
declaring
that
he
had
never
done
anything
of
the
sort
spilett
resolved
to
recur
to
this
incident
as
soon
as
the
bonadventure
returned
and
to
urge
cyrus
harding
to
acquaint
their
companions
with
these
strange
facts
perhaps
it
would
be
decided
to
make
in
common
a
complete
investigation
of
every
part
of
lincoln
island
however
that
might
be
on
this
evening
no
fire
was
lighted
on
these
yet
unknown
shores
which
formed
the
entrance
to
the
gulf
and
the
little
vessel
stood
off
during
the
night
when
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
appeared
in
the
western
horizon
the
wind
which
had
slightly
fallen
shifted
two
points
and
enabled
pencroft
to
enter
the
narrow
gulf
with
greater
ease
towards
seven
oclock
in
the
morning
the
bonadventure
weathering
the
north
mandible
cape
entered
the
strait
and
glided
on
to
the
waters
so
strangely
enclosed
in
the
frame
of
lava
well
said
pencroft
this
bay
would
make
admirable
roads
in
which
a
whole
fleet
could
lie
at
their
ease
what
is
especially
curious
observed
harding
is
that
the
gulf
has
been
formed
by
two
rivers
of
lava
thrown
out
by
the
volcano
and
accumulated
by
successive
eruptions
the
result
is
that
the
gulf
is
completely
sheltered
on
all
sides
and
i
believe
that
even
in
the
stormiest
weather
the
sea
here
must
be
as
calm
as
a
lake
no
doubt
returned
the
sailor
since
the
wind
has
only
that
narrow
entrance
between
the
two
capes
to
get
in
by
and
besides
the
north
cape
protects
that
of
the
south
in
a
way
which
would
make
the
entrance
of
gusts
very
difficult
i
declare
our
bonadventure
could
stay
here
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
without
even
dragging
at
her
anchor
it
is
rather
large
for
her
observed
the
reporter
well
mr
spilett
replied
the
sailor
i
agree
that
it
is
too
large
for
the
bonadventure
but
if
the
fleets
of
the
union
were
in
want
of
a
harbor
in
the
pacific
i
dont
think
they
would
ever
find
a
better
place
than
this
we
are
in
the
sharks
mouth
remarked
neb
alluding
to
the
form
of
the
gulf
right
into
its
mouth
my
honest
neb
replied
herbert
but
you
are
not
afraid
that
it
will
shut
upon
us
are
you
no
mr
herbert
answered
neb
and
yet
this
gulf
here
doesnt
please
me
much
it
has
a
wicked
look
hallo
cried
pencroft
here
is
neb
turning
up
his
nose
at
my
gulf
just
as
i
was
thinking
of
presenting
it
to
america
but
at
any
rate
is
the
water
deep
enough
asked
the
engineer
for
a
depth
sufficient
for
the
keel
of
the
bonadventure
would
not
be
enough
for
those
of
our
ironclads
that
is
easily
found
out
replied
pencroft
and
the
sailor
sounded
with
a
long
cord
which
served
him
as
a
leadline
and
to
which
was
fastened
a
lump
of
iron
this
cord
measured
nearly
fifty
fathoms
and
its
entire
length
was
unrolled
without
finding
any
bottom
there
exclaimed
pencroft
our
ironclads
can
come
here
after
all
they
would
not
run
aground
indeed
said
gideon
spilett
this
gulf
is
a
regular
abyss
but
taking
into
consideration
the
volcanic
origin
of
the
island
it
is
not
astonishing
that
the
sea
should
offer
similar
depressions
one
would
say
too
observed
herbert
that
these
cliffs
were
perfectly
perpendicular
and
i
believe
that
at
their
foot
even
with
a
line
five
or
six
times
longer
pencroft
would
not
find
bottom
that
is
all
very
well
then
said
the
reporter
but
i
must
point
out
to
pencroft
that
his
harbor
is
wanting
in
one
very
important
respect
and
what
is
that
mr
spilett
an
opening
a
cutting
of
some
sort
to
give
access
to
the
interior
of
the
island
i
do
not
see
a
spot
on
which
we
could
land
and
in
fact
the
steep
lava
cliffs
did
not
afford
a
single
place
suitable
for
landing
they
formed
an
insuperable
barrier
recalling
but
with
more
wildness
the
fiords
of
norway
the
bonadventure
coasting
as
close
as
possible
along
the
cliffs
did
not
discover
even
a
projection
which
would
allow
the
passengers
to
leave
the
deck
pencroft
consoled
himself
by
saying
that
with
the
help
of
a
mine
they
could
soon
open
out
the
cliff
when
that
was
necessary
and
then
as
there
was
evidently
nothing
to
be
done
in
the
gulf
he
steered
his
vessel
towards
the
strait
and
passed
out
at
about
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
ah
said
neb
uttering
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
one
might
really
say
that
the
honest
negro
did
not
feel
at
his
ease
in
those
enormous
jaws
the
distance
from
mandible
cape
to
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
was
not
more
than
eight
miles
the
head
of
the
bonadventure
was
put
towards
granite
house
and
a
fair
wind
filling
her
sails
she
ran
rapidly
along
the
coast
to
the
enormous
lava
rocks
succeeded
soon
those
capricious
sand
dunes
among
which
the
engineer
had
been
so
singularly
recovered
and
which
seabirds
frequented
in
thousands
about
four
oclock
pencroft
leaving
the
point
of
the
islet
on
his
left
entered
the
channel
which
separated
it
from
the
coast
and
at
five
oclock
the
anchor
of
the
bonadventure
was
buried
in
the
sand
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
the
colonists
had
been
absent
three
days
from
their
dwelling
ayrton
was
waiting
for
them
on
the
beach
and
jup
came
joyously
to
meet
them
giving
vent
to
deep
grunts
of
satisfaction
a
complete
exploration
of
the
coast
of
the
island
had
now
been
made
and
no
suspicious
appearances
had
been
observed
if
any
mysterious
being
resided
on
it
it
could
only
be
under
cover
of
the
impenetrable
forest
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
to
which
the
colonists
had
not
yet
directed
their
investigations
gideon
spilett
discussed
these
things
with
the
engineer
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
direct
the
attention
of
their
companions
to
the
strange
character
of
certain
incidents
which
had
occurred
on
the
island
and
of
which
the
last
was
the
most
unaccountable
however
harding
returning
to
the
fact
of
a
fire
having
been
kindled
on
the
shore
by
an
unknown
hand
could
not
refrain
from
repeating
for
the
twentieth
time
to
the
reporter
but
are
you
quite
sure
of
having
seen
it
was
it
not
a
partial
eruption
of
the
volcano
or
perhaps
some
meteor
no
cyrus
answered
the
reporter
it
was
certainly
a
fire
lighted
by
the
hand
of
man
besides
question
pencroft
and
herbert
they
saw
it
as
i
saw
it
myself
and
they
will
confirm
my
words
in
consequence
therefore
a
few
days
after
on
the
25th
of
april
in
the
evening
when
the
settlers
were
all
collected
on
prospect
heights
cyrus
harding
began
by
saying
my
friends
i
think
it
my
duty
to
call
your
attention
to
certain
incidents
which
have
occurred
in
the
island
on
the
subject
of
which
i
shall
be
happy
to
have
your
advice
these
incidents
are
so
to
speak
supernatural
supernatural
exclaimed
the
sailor
emitting
a
volume
of
smoke
from
his
mouth
can
it
be
possible
that
our
island
is
supernatural
no
pencroft
but
mysterious
most
certainly
replied
the
engineer
unless
you
can
explain
that
which
spilett
and
i
have
until
now
failed
to
understand
speak
away
captain
answered
the
sailor
well
have
you
understood
then
said
the
engineer
how
was
it
that
after
falling
into
the
sea
i
was
found
a
quarter
of
a
mile
into
the
interior
of
the
island
and
that
without
my
having
any
consciousness
of
my
removal
there
unless
being
unconscious
said
pencroft
that
is
not
admissible
replied
the
engineer
but
to
continue
have
you
understood
how
top
was
able
to
discover
your
retreat
five
miles
from
the
cave
in
which
i
was
lying
the
dogs
instinct
observed
herbert
singular
instinct
returned
the
reporter
since
notwithstanding
the
storm
of
rain
and
wind
which
was
raging
during
that
night
top
arrived
at
the
chimneys
dry
and
without
a
speck
of
mud
let
us
continue
resumed
the
engineer
have
you
understood
how
our
dog
was
so
strangely
thrown
up
out
of
the
water
of
the
lake
after
his
struggle
with
the
dugong
no
i
confess
not
at
all
replied
pencroft
and
the
wound
which
the
dugong
had
in
its
side
a
wound
which
seemed
to
have
been
made
with
a
sharp
instrument
that
cant
be
understood
either
let
us
continue
again
said
harding
have
you
understood
my
friends
how
that
bullet
got
into
the
body
of
the
young
peccary
how
that
case
happened
to
be
so
fortunately
stranded
without
there
being
any
trace
of
a
wreck
how
that
bottle
containing
the
document
presented
itself
so
opportunely
during
our
first
seaexcursion
how
our
canoe
having
broken
its
moorings
floated
down
the
current
of
the
mercy
and
rejoined
us
at
the
very
moment
we
needed
it
how
after
the
ape
invasion
the
ladder
was
so
obligingly
thrown
down
from
granite
house
and
lastly
how
the
document
which
ayrton
asserts
was
never
written
by
him
fell
into
our
hands
as
cyrus
harding
thus
enumerated
without
forgetting
one
the
singular
incidents
which
had
occurred
in
the
island
herbert
neb
and
pencroft
stared
at
each
other
not
knowing
what
to
reply
for
this
succession
of
incidents
grouped
thus
for
the
first
time
could
not
but
excite
their
surprise
to
the
highest
degree
pon
my
word
said
pencroft
at
last
you
are
right
captain
and
it
is
difficult
to
explain
all
these
things
well
my
friends
resumed
the
engineer
a
last
fact
has
just
been
added
to
these
and
it
is
no
less
incomprehensible
than
the
others
what
is
it
captain
asked
herbert
quickly
when
you
were
returning
from
tabor
island
pencroft
continued
the
engineer
you
said
that
a
fire
appeared
on
lincoln
island
certainly
answered
the
sailor
and
you
are
quite
certain
of
having
seen
this
fire
as
sure
as
i
see
you
now
you
also
herbert
why
captain
cried
herbert
that
fire
was
blazing
like
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
but
was
it
not
a
star
urged
the
engineer
no
replied
pencroft
for
the
sky
was
covered
with
thick
clouds
and
at
any
rate
a
star
would
not
have
been
so
low
on
the
horizon
but
mr
spilett
saw
it
as
well
as
we
and
he
will
confirm
our
words
i
will
add
said
the
reporter
that
the
fire
was
very
bright
and
that
it
shot
up
like
a
sheet
of
lightning
yes
yes
exactly
added
herbert
and
it
was
certainly
placed
on
the
heights
of
granite
house
well
my
friends
replied
cyrus
harding
during
the
night
of
the
19th
of
october
neither
neb
nor
i
lighted
any
fire
on
the
coast
you
did
not
exclaimed
pencroft
in
the
height
of
his
astonishment
not
being
able
to
finish
his
sentence
we
did
not
leave
granite
house
answered
cyrus
harding
and
if
a
fire
appeared
on
the
coast
it
was
lighted
by
another
hand
than
ours
pencroft
herbert
and
neb
were
stupefied
no
illusion
could
be
possible
and
a
fire
had
actually
met
their
eyes
during
the
night
of
the
19th
of
october
yes
they
had
to
acknowledge
it
a
mystery
existed
an
inexplicable
influence
evidently
favorable
to
the
colonists
but
very
irritating
to
their
curiosity
was
executed
always
in
the
nick
of
time
on
lincoln
island
could
there
be
some
being
hidden
in
its
profoundest
recesses
it
was
necessary
at
any
cost
to
ascertain
this
harding
also
reminded
his
companions
of
the
singular
behavior
of
top
and
jup
when
they
prowled
round
the
mouth
of
the
well
which
placed
granite
house
in
communication
with
the
sea
and
he
told
them
that
he
had
explored
the
well
without
discovering
anything
suspicious
the
final
resolve
taken
in
consequence
of
this
conversation
by
all
the
members
of
the
colony
was
that
as
soon
as
the
fine
season
returned
they
would
thoroughly
search
the
whole
of
the
island
but
from
that
day
pencroft
appeared
to
be
anxious
he
felt
as
if
the
island
which
he
had
made
his
own
personal
property
belonged
to
him
entirely
no
longer
and
that
he
shared
it
with
another
master
to
whom
willing
or
not
he
felt
subject
neb
and
he
often
talked
of
those
unaccountable
things
and
both
their
natures
inclining
them
to
the
marvelous
were
not
far
from
believing
that
lincoln
island
was
under
the
dominion
of
some
supernatural
power
in
the
meanwhile
the
bad
weather
came
with
the
month
of
may
the
november
of
the
northern
zones
it
appeared
that
the
winter
would
be
severe
and
forward
the
preparations
for
the
winter
season
were
therefore
commenced
without
delay
nevertheless
the
colonists
were
well
prepared
to
meet
the
winter
however
hard
it
might
be
they
had
plenty
of
felt
clothing
and
the
musmons
very
numerous
by
this
time
had
furnished
an
abundance
of
wool
necessary
for
the
manufacture
of
this
warm
material
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
ayrton
had
been
provided
with
this
comfortable
clothing
cyrus
harding
proposed
that
he
should
come
to
spend
the
bad
season
with
them
in
granite
house
where
he
would
be
better
lodged
than
at
the
corral
and
ayrton
promised
to
do
so
as
soon
as
the
last
work
at
the
corral
was
finished
he
did
this
towards
the
middle
of
april
from
that
time
ayrton
shared
the
common
life
and
made
himself
useful
on
all
occasions
but
still
humble
and
sad
he
never
took
part
in
the
pleasures
of
his
companions
for
the
greater
part
of
this
the
third
winter
which
the
settlers
passed
in
lincoln
island
they
were
confined
to
granite
house
there
were
many
violent
storms
and
frightful
tempests
which
appeared
to
shake
the
rocks
to
their
very
foundations
immense
waves
threatened
to
overwhelm
the
island
and
certainly
any
vessel
anchored
near
the
shore
would
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
twice
during
one
of
these
hurricanes
the
mercy
swelled
to
such
a
degree
as
to
give
reason
to
fear
that
the
bridges
would
be
swept
away
and
it
was
necessary
to
strengthen
those
on
the
shore
which
disappeared
under
the
foaming
waters
when
the
sea
beat
against
the
beach
it
may
well
be
supposed
that
such
storms
comparable
to
waterspouts
in
which
were
mingled
rain
and
snow
would
cause
great
havoc
on
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
the
mill
and
the
poultryyard
particularly
suffered
the
colonists
were
often
obliged
to
make
immediate
repairs
without
which
the
safety
of
the
birds
would
have
been
seriously
threatened
during
the
worst
weather
several
jaguars
and
troops
of
quadrumana
ventured
to
the
edge
of
the
plateau
and
it
was
always
to
be
feared
that
the
most
active
and
audacious
would
urged
by
hunger
manage
to
cross
the
stream
which
besides
when
frozen
offered
them
an
easy
passage
plantations
and
domestic
animals
would
then
have
been
infallibly
destroyed
without
a
constant
watch
and
it
was
often
necessary
to
make
use
of
the
guns
to
keep
those
dangerous
visitors
at
a
respectful
distance
occupation
was
not
wanting
to
the
colonists
for
without
reckoning
their
outdoor
cares
they
had
always
a
thousand
plans
for
the
fitting
up
of
granite
house
they
had
also
some
fine
sporting
excursions
which
were
made
during
the
frost
in
the
vast
tadorn
marsh
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
aided
by
jup
and
top
did
not
miss
a
shot
in
the
midst
of
myriads
of
wildduck
snipe
teal
and
others
the
access
to
these
huntinggrounds
was
easy
besides
whether
they
reached
them
by
the
road
to
port
balloon
after
having
passed
the
mercy
bridge
or
by
turning
the
rocks
from
flotsam
point
the
hunters
were
never
distant
from
granite
house
more
than
two
or
three
miles
thus
passed
the
four
winter
months
which
were
really
rigorous
that
is
to
say
june
july
august
and
september
but
in
short
granite
house
did
not
suffer
much
from
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
and
it
was
the
same
with
the
corral
which
less
exposed
than
the
plateau
and
sheltered
partly
by
mount
franklin
only
received
the
remains
of
the
hurricanes
already
broken
by
the
forests
and
the
high
rocks
of
the
shore
the
damages
there
were
consequently
of
small
importance
and
the
activity
and
skill
of
ayrton
promptly
repaired
them
when
some
time
in
october
he
returned
to
pass
a
few
days
in
the
corral
during
this
winter
no
fresh
inexplicable
incident
occurred
nothing
strange
happened
although
pencroft
and
neb
were
on
the
watch
for
the
most
insignificant
facts
to
which
they
attached
any
mysterious
cause
top
and
jup
themselves
no
longer
growled
round
the
well
or
gave
any
signs
of
uneasiness
it
appeared
therefore
as
if
the
series
of
supernatural
incidents
was
interrupted
although
they
often
talked
of
them
during
the
evenings
in
granite
house
and
they
remained
thoroughly
resolved
that
the
island
should
be
searched
even
in
those
parts
the
most
difficult
to
explore
but
an
event
of
the
highest
importance
and
of
which
the
consequences
might
be
terrible
momentarily
diverted
from
their
projects
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
it
was
the
month
of
october
the
fine
season
was
swiftly
returning
nature
was
reviving
and
among
the
evergreen
foliage
of
the
coniferae
which
formed
the
border
of
the
wood
already
appeared
the
young
leaves
of
the
banksias
deodars
and
other
trees
it
may
be
remembered
that
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
had
at
different
times
taken
photographic
views
of
lincoln
island
now
on
the
17th
of
this
month
of
october
towards
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
herbert
enticed
by
the
charms
of
the
sky
thought
of
reproducing
union
bay
which
was
opposite
to
prospect
heights
from
cape
mandible
to
claw
cape
the
horizon
was
beautifully
clear
and
the
sea
undulating
under
a
soft
breeze
was
as
calm
as
the
waters
of
a
lake
sparkling
here
and
there
under
the
suns
rays
the
apparatus
had
been
placed
at
one
of
the
windows
of
the
diningroom
at
granite
house
and
consequently
overlooked
the
shore
and
the
bay
herbert
proceeded
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
and
the
negative
obtained
he
went
away
to
fix
it
by
means
of
the
chemicals
deposited
in
a
dark
nook
of
granite
house
returning
to
the
bright
light
and
examining
it
well
herbert
perceived
on
his
negative
an
almost
imperceptible
little
spot
on
the
sea
horizon
he
endeavored
to
make
it
disappear
by
reiterated
washing
but
could
not
accomplish
it
it
is
a
flaw
in
the
glass
he
thought
and
then
he
had
the
curiosity
to
examine
this
flaw
with
a
strong
magnifier
which
he
unscrewed
from
one
of
the
telescopes
but
he
had
scarcely
looked
at
it
when
he
uttered
a
cry
and
the
glass
almost
fell
from
his
hands
immediately
running
to
the
room
in
which
cyrus
harding
then
was
he
extended
the
negative
and
magnifier
towards
the
engineer
pointing
out
the
little
spot
harding
examined
it
then
seizing
his
telescope
he
rushed
to
the
window
the
telescope
after
having
slowly
swept
the
horizon
at
last
stopped
on
the
lookedfor
spot
and
cyrus
harding
lowering
it
pronounced
one
word
only
a
vessel
and
in
fact
a
vessel
was
in
sight
off
lincoln
island

the
secret
of
the
island
chapter
1
it
was
now
two
years
and
a
half
since
the
castaways
from
the
balloon
had
been
thrown
on
lincoln
island
and
during
that
period
there
had
been
no
communication
between
them
and
their
fellowcreatures
once
the
reporter
had
attempted
to
communicate
with
the
inhabited
world
by
confiding
to
a
bird
a
letter
which
contained
the
secret
of
their
situation
but
that
was
a
chance
on
which
it
was
impossible
to
reckon
seriously
ayrton
alone
under
the
circumstances
which
have
been
related
had
come
to
join
the
little
colony
now
suddenly
on
this
day
the
17th
of
october
other
men
had
unexpectedly
appeared
in
sight
of
the
island
on
that
deserted
sea
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
a
vessel
was
there
but
would
she
pass
on
or
would
she
put
into
port
in
a
few
hours
the
colonists
would
definitely
know
what
to
expect
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
having
immediately
called
gideon
spilett
pencroft
and
neb
into
the
diningroom
of
granite
house
told
them
what
had
happened
pencroft
seizing
the
telescope
rapidly
swept
the
horizon
and
stopping
on
the
indicated
point
that
is
to
say
on
that
which
had
made
the
almost
imperceptible
spot
on
the
photographic
negative
im
blessed
but
it
is
really
a
vessel
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
which
did
not
express
any
great
amount
of
satisfaction
is
she
coming
here
asked
gideon
spilett
impossible
to
say
anything
yet
answered
pencroft
for
her
rigging
alone
is
above
the
horizon
and
not
a
bit
of
her
hull
can
be
seen
what
is
to
be
done
asked
the
lad
wait
replied
harding
and
for
a
considerable
time
the
settlers
remained
silent
given
up
to
all
the
thoughts
and
the
emotions
all
the
fears
all
the
hopes
which
were
aroused
by
this
incidentthe
most
important
which
had
occurred
since
their
arrival
in
lincoln
island
certainly
the
colonists
were
not
in
the
situation
of
castaways
abandoned
on
a
sterile
islet
constantly
contending
against
a
cruel
nature
for
their
miserable
existence
and
incessantly
tormented
by
the
longing
to
return
to
inhabited
countries
pencroft
and
neb
especially
who
felt
themselves
at
once
so
happy
and
so
rich
would
not
have
left
their
island
without
regret
they
were
accustomed
besides
to
this
new
life
in
the
midst
of
the
domain
which
their
intelligence
had
as
it
were
civilized
but
at
any
rate
this
ship
brought
news
from
the
world
perhaps
even
from
their
native
land
it
was
bringing
fellowcreatures
to
them
and
it
may
be
conceived
how
deeply
their
hearts
were
moved
at
the
sight
from
time
to
time
pencroft
took
the
glass
and
rested
himself
at
the
window
from
thence
he
very
attentively
examined
the
vessel
which
was
at
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
to
the
east
the
colonists
had
as
yet
therefore
no
means
of
signalizing
their
presence
a
flag
would
not
have
been
perceived
a
gun
would
not
have
been
heard
a
fire
would
not
have
been
visible
however
it
was
certain
that
the
island
overtopped
by
mount
franklin
could
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
vessels
lookout
but
why
was
the
ship
coming
there
was
it
simple
chance
which
brought
it
to
that
part
of
the
pacific
where
the
maps
mentioned
no
land
except
tabor
island
which
itself
was
out
of
the
route
usually
followed
by
vessels
from
the
polynesian
archipelagoes
from
new
zealand
and
from
the
american
coast
to
this
question
which
each
one
asked
himself
a
reply
was
suddenly
made
by
herbert
can
it
be
the
duncan
he
cried
the
duncan
as
has
been
said
was
lord
glenarvans
yacht
which
had
left
ayrton
on
the
islet
and
which
was
to
return
there
someday
to
fetch
him
now
the
islet
was
not
so
far
distant
from
lincoln
island
but
that
a
vessel
standing
for
the
one
could
pass
in
sight
of
the
other
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
only
separated
them
in
longitude
and
seventy
in
latitude
we
must
tell
ayrton
said
gideon
spilett
and
send
for
him
immediately
he
alone
can
say
if
it
is
the
duncan
this
was
the
opinion
of
all
and
the
reporter
going
to
the
telegraphic
apparatus
which
placed
the
corral
in
communication
with
granite
house
sent
this
telegramcome
with
all
possible
speed
in
a
few
minutes
the
bell
sounded
i
am
coming
replied
ayrton
then
the
settlers
continued
to
watch
the
vessel
if
it
is
the
duncan
said
herbert
ayrton
will
recognize
her
without
difficulty
since
he
sailed
on
board
her
for
some
time
and
if
he
recognizes
her
added
pencroft
it
will
agitate
him
exceedingly
yes
answered
cyrus
harding
but
now
ayrton
is
worthy
to
return
on
board
the
duncan
and
pray
heaven
that
it
is
indeed
lord
glenarvans
yacht
for
i
should
be
suspicious
of
any
other
vessel
these
are
illfamed
seas
and
i
have
always
feared
a
visit
from
malay
pirates
to
our
island
we
could
defend
it
cried
herbert
no
doubt
my
boy
answered
the
engineer
smiling
but
it
would
be
better
not
to
have
to
defend
it
a
useless
observation
said
spilett
lincoln
island
is
unknown
to
navigators
since
it
is
not
marked
even
on
the
most
recent
maps
do
you
think
cyrus
that
that
is
a
sufficient
motive
for
a
ship
finding
herself
unexpectedly
in
sight
of
new
land
to
try
and
visit
rather
than
avoid
it
certainly
replied
pencroft
i
think
so
too
added
the
engineer
it
may
even
be
said
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
captain
to
come
and
survey
any
land
or
island
not
yet
known
and
lincoln
island
is
in
this
position
well
said
pencroft
suppose
this
vessel
comes
and
anchors
there
a
few
cableslengths
from
our
island
what
shall
we
do
this
sudden
question
remained
at
first
without
any
reply
but
cyrus
harding
after
some
moments
thought
replied
in
the
calm
tone
which
was
usual
to
him
what
we
shall
do
my
friends
what
we
ought
to
do
is
thiswe
will
communicate
with
the
ship
we
will
take
our
passage
on
board
her
and
we
will
leave
our
island
after
having
taken
possession
of
it
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
then
we
will
return
with
any
who
may
wish
to
follow
us
to
colonize
it
definitely
and
endow
the
american
republic
with
a
useful
station
in
this
part
of
the
pacific
ocean
hurrah
exclaimed
pencroft
and
that
will
be
no
small
present
which
we
shall
make
to
our
country
the
colonization
is
already
almost
finished
names
are
given
to
every
part
of
the
island
there
is
a
natural
port
fresh
water
roads
a
telegraph
a
dockyard
and
manufactories
and
there
will
be
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
inscribe
lincoln
island
on
the
maps
but
if
anyone
seizes
it
in
our
absence
observed
gideon
spilett
hang
it
cried
the
sailor
i
would
rather
remain
all
alone
to
guard
it
and
trust
to
pencroft
they
shouldnt
steal
it
from
him
like
a
watch
from
the
pocket
of
a
swell
for
an
hour
it
was
impossible
to
say
with
any
certainty
whether
the
vessel
was
or
was
not
standing
towards
lincoln
island
she
was
nearer
but
in
what
direction
was
she
sailing
this
pencroft
could
not
determine
however
as
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
northeast
in
all
probability
the
vessel
was
sailing
on
the
starboard
tack
besides
the
wind
was
favorable
for
bringing
her
towards
the
island
and
the
sea
being
calm
she
would
not
be
afraid
to
approach
although
the
shallows
were
not
marked
on
the
chart
towards
four
oclockan
hour
after
he
had
been
sent
forayrton
arrived
at
granite
house
he
entered
the
diningroom
saying
at
your
service
gentlemen
cyrus
harding
gave
him
his
hand
as
was
his
custom
to
do
and
leading
him
to
the
window
ayrton
said
he
we
have
begged
you
to
come
here
for
an
important
reason
a
ship
is
in
sight
of
the
island
ayrton
at
first
paled
slightly
and
for
a
moment
his
eyes
became
dim
then
leaning
out
the
window
he
surveyed
the
horizon
but
could
see
nothing
take
this
telescope
said
spilett
and
look
carefully
ayrton
for
it
is
possible
that
this
ship
may
be
the
duncan
come
to
these
seas
for
the
purpose
of
taking
you
home
again
the
duncan
murmured
ayrton
already
this
last
word
escaped
ayrtons
lips
as
if
involuntarily
and
his
head
drooped
upon
his
hands
did
not
twelve
years
solitude
on
a
desert
island
appear
to
him
a
sufficient
expiation
did
not
the
penitent
yet
feel
himself
pardoned
either
in
his
own
eyes
or
in
the
eyes
of
others
no
said
he
no
it
cannot
be
the
duncan
look
ayrton
then
said
the
engineer
for
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
know
beforehand
what
to
expect
ayrton
took
the
glass
and
pointed
it
in
the
direction
indicated
during
some
minutes
he
examined
the
horizon
without
moving
without
uttering
a
word
then
it
is
indeed
a
vessel
said
he
but
i
do
not
think
she
is
the
duncan
why
do
you
not
think
so
asked
gideon
spilett
because
the
duncan
is
a
steamyacht
and
i
cannot
perceive
any
trace
of
smoke
either
above
or
near
that
vessel
perhaps
she
is
simply
sailing
observed
pencroft
the
wind
is
favorable
for
the
direction
which
she
appears
to
be
taking
and
she
may
be
anxious
to
economize
her
coal
being
so
far
from
land
it
is
possible
that
you
may
be
right
mr
pencroft
answered
ayrton
and
that
the
vessel
has
extinguished
her
fires
we
must
wait
until
she
is
nearer
and
then
we
shall
soon
know
what
to
expect
so
saying
ayrton
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
remained
silent
the
colonists
again
discussed
the
strange
ship
but
ayrton
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
all
were
in
such
a
mood
that
they
found
it
impossible
to
continue
their
work
gideon
spilett
and
pencroft
were
particularly
nervous
going
coming
not
able
to
remain
still
in
one
place
herbert
felt
more
curiosity
neb
alone
maintained
his
usual
calm
manner
was
not
his
country
that
where
his
master
was
as
to
the
engineer
he
remained
plunged
in
deep
thought
and
in
his
heart
feared
rather
than
desired
the
arrival
of
the
ship
in
the
meanwhile
the
vessel
was
a
little
nearer
the
island
with
the
aid
of
the
glass
it
was
ascertained
that
she
was
a
brig
and
not
one
of
those
malay
proas
which
are
generally
used
by
the
pirates
of
the
pacific
it
was
therefore
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
engineers
apprehensions
would
not
be
justified
and
that
the
presence
of
this
vessel
in
the
vicinity
of
the
island
was
fraught
with
no
danger
pencroft
after
a
minute
examination
was
able
positively
to
affirm
that
the
vessel
was
rigged
as
a
brig
and
that
she
was
standing
obliquely
towards
the
coast
on
the
starboard
tack
under
her
topsails
and
topgallantsails
this
was
confirmed
by
ayrton
but
by
continuing
in
this
direction
she
must
soon
disappear
behind
claw
cape
as
the
wind
was
from
the
southwest
and
to
watch
her
it
would
be
then
necessary
to
ascend
the
height
of
washington
bay
near
port
balloona
provoking
circumstance
for
it
was
already
five
oclock
in
the
evening
and
the
twilight
would
soon
make
any
observation
extremely
difficult
what
shall
we
do
when
night
comes
on
asked
gideon
spilett
shall
we
light
a
fire
so
as
to
signal
our
presence
on
the
coast
this
was
a
serious
question
and
yet
although
the
engineer
still
retained
some
of
his
presentiments
it
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
during
the
night
the
ship
might
disappear
and
leave
for
ever
and
this
ship
gone
would
another
ever
return
to
the
waters
of
lincoln
island
who
could
foresee
what
the
future
would
then
have
in
store
for
the
colonists
yes
said
the
reporter
we
ought
to
make
known
to
that
vessel
whoever
she
may
be
that
the
island
is
inhabited
to
neglect
the
opportunity
which
is
offered
to
us
might
be
to
create
everlasting
regrets
it
was
therefore
decided
that
neb
and
pencroft
should
go
to
port
balloon
and
that
there
at
nightfall
they
should
light
an
immense
fire
the
blaze
of
which
would
necessarily
attract
the
attention
of
the
brig
but
at
the
moment
when
neb
and
the
sailor
were
preparing
to
leave
granite
house
the
vessel
suddenly
altered
her
course
and
stood
directly
for
union
bay
the
brig
was
a
good
sailer
for
she
approached
rapidly
neb
and
pencroft
put
off
their
departure
therefore
and
the
glass
was
put
into
ayrtons
hands
that
he
might
ascertain
for
certain
whether
the
ship
was
or
was
not
the
duncan
the
scotch
yacht
was
also
rigged
as
a
brig
the
question
was
whether
a
chimney
could
be
discerned
between
the
two
masts
of
the
vessel
which
was
now
at
a
distance
of
only
five
miles
the
horizon
was
still
very
clear
the
examination
was
easy
and
ayrton
soon
let
the
glass
fall
again
saying
it
is
not
the
duncan
it
could
not
be
pencroft
again
brought
the
brig
within
the
range
of
the
telescope
and
could
see
that
she
was
of
between
three
and
four
hundred
tons
burden
wonderfully
narrow
wellmasted
admirably
built
and
must
be
a
very
rapid
sailer
but
to
what
nation
did
she
belong
that
was
difficult
to
say
and
yet
added
the
sailor
a
flag
is
floating
from
her
peak
but
i
cannot
distinguish
the
colors
of
it
in
half
an
hour
we
shall
be
certain
about
that
answered
the
reporter
besides
it
is
very
evident
that
the
intention
of
the
captain
of
this
ship
is
to
land
and
consequently
if
not
today
tomorrow
at
the
latest
we
shall
make
his
acquaintance
never
mind
said
pencroft
it
is
best
to
know
whom
we
have
to
deal
with
and
i
shall
not
be
sorry
to
recognize
that
fellows
colors
and
while
thus
speaking
the
sailor
never
left
the
glass
the
day
began
to
fade
and
with
the
day
the
breeze
fell
also
the
brigs
ensign
hung
in
folds
and
it
became
more
and
more
difficult
to
observe
it
it
is
not
the
american
flag
said
pencroft
from
time
to
time
nor
the
english
the
red
of
which
could
be
easily
seen
nor
the
french
or
german
colors
nor
the
white
flag
of
russia
nor
the
yellow
of
spain
one
would
say
it
was
all
one
color
lets
see
in
these
seas
what
do
we
generally
meet
with
the
chilean
flagbut
that
is
tricolor
brazilianit
is
green
japaneseit
is
yellow
and
black
while
this
at
that
moment
the
breeze
blew
out
the
unknown
flag
ayrton
seizing
the
telescope
which
the
sailor
had
put
down
put
it
to
his
eye
and
in
a
hoarse
voice
the
black
flag
he
exclaimed
and
indeed
the
somber
bunting
was
floating
from
the
mast
of
the
brig
and
they
had
now
good
reason
for
considering
her
to
be
a
suspicious
vessel
had
the
engineer
then
been
right
in
his
presentiments
was
this
a
pirate
vessel
did
she
scour
the
pacific
competing
with
the
malay
proas
which
still
infest
it
for
what
had
she
come
to
look
at
the
shores
of
lincoln
island
was
it
to
them
an
unknown
island
ready
to
become
a
magazine
for
stolen
cargoes
had
she
come
to
find
on
the
coast
a
sheltered
port
for
the
winter
months
was
the
settlers
honest
domain
destined
to
be
transformed
into
an
infamous
refugethe
headquarters
of
the
piracy
of
the
pacific
all
these
ideas
instinctively
presented
themselves
to
the
colonists
imaginations
there
was
no
doubt
besides
of
the
signification
which
must
be
attached
to
the
color
of
the
hoisted
flag
it
was
that
of
pirates
it
was
that
which
the
duncan
would
have
carried
had
the
convicts
succeeded
in
their
criminal
design
no
time
was
lost
before
discussing
it
my
friends
said
cyrus
harding
perhaps
this
vessel
only
wishes
to
survey
the
coast
of
the
island
perhaps
her
crew
will
not
land
there
is
a
chance
of
it
however
that
may
be
we
ought
to
do
everything
we
can
to
hide
our
presence
here
the
windmill
on
prospect
heights
is
too
easily
seen
let
ayrton
and
neb
go
and
take
down
the
sails
we
must
also
conceal
the
windows
of
granite
house
with
thick
branches
all
the
fires
must
be
extinguished
so
that
nothing
may
betray
the
presence
of
men
on
the
island
and
our
vessel
said
herbert
oh
answered
pencroft
she
is
sheltered
in
port
balloon
and
i
defy
any
of
those
rascals
there
to
find
her
the
engineers
orders
were
immediately
executed
neb
and
ayrton
ascended
the
plateau
and
took
the
necessary
precautions
to
conceal
any
indication
of
a
settlement
while
they
were
thus
occupied
their
companions
went
to
the
border
of
jacamar
wood
and
brought
back
a
large
quantity
of
branches
and
creepers
which
would
at
some
distance
appear
as
natural
foliage
and
thus
disguise
the
windows
in
the
granite
cliff
at
the
same
time
the
ammunition
and
guns
were
placed
ready
so
as
to
be
at
hand
in
case
of
an
unexpected
attack
when
all
these
precautions
had
been
taken
my
friends
said
harding
and
his
voice
betrayed
some
emotion
if
the
wretches
endeavor
to
seize
lincoln
island
we
shall
defend
itshall
we
not
yes
cyrus
replied
the
reporter
and
if
necessary
we
will
die
to
defend
it
the
engineer
extended
his
hand
to
his
companions
who
pressed
it
warmly
ayrton
remained
in
his
corner
not
joining
the
colonists
perhaps
he
the
former
convict
still
felt
himself
unworthy
to
do
so
cyrus
harding
understood
what
was
passing
in
ayrtons
mind
and
going
to
him
and
you
ayrton
he
asked
what
will
you
do
my
duty
answered
ayrton
he
then
took
up
his
station
near
the
window
and
gazed
through
the
foliage
it
was
now
halfpast
seven
the
sun
had
disappeared
twenty
minutes
ago
behind
granite
house
consequently
the
eastern
horizon
was
becoming
obscured
in
the
meanwhile
the
brig
continued
to
advance
towards
union
bay
she
was
now
not
more
than
two
miles
off
and
exactly
opposite
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
for
after
having
tacked
off
claw
cape
she
had
drifted
towards
the
north
in
the
current
of
the
rising
tide
one
might
have
said
that
at
this
distance
she
had
already
entered
the
vast
bay
for
a
straight
line
drawn
from
claw
cape
to
cape
mandible
would
have
rested
on
her
starboard
quarter
was
the
brig
about
to
penetrate
far
into
the
bay
that
was
the
first
question
when
once
in
the
bay
would
she
anchor
there
that
was
the
second
would
she
not
content
herself
with
only
surveying
the
coast
and
stand
out
to
sea
again
without
landing
her
crew
they
would
know
this
in
an
hour
the
colonists
could
do
nothing
but
wait
cyrus
harding
had
not
seen
the
suspected
vessel
hoist
the
black
flag
without
deep
anxiety
was
it
not
a
direct
menace
against
the
work
which
he
and
his
companions
had
till
now
conducted
so
successfully
had
these
piratesfor
the
sailors
of
the
brig
could
be
nothing
elsealready
visited
the
island
since
on
approaching
it
they
had
hoisted
their
colors
had
they
formerly
invaded
it
so
that
certain
unaccountable
peculiarities
might
be
explained
in
this
way
did
there
exist
in
the
as
yet
unexplored
parts
some
accomplice
ready
to
enter
into
communication
with
them
to
all
these
questions
which
he
mentally
asked
himself
harding
knew
not
what
to
reply
but
he
felt
that
the
safety
of
the
colony
could
not
but
be
seriously
threatened
by
the
arrival
of
the
brig
however
he
and
his
companions
were
determined
to
fight
to
the
last
gasp
it
would
have
been
very
important
to
know
if
the
pirates
were
numerous
and
better
armed
than
the
colonists
but
how
was
this
information
to
be
obtained
night
fell
the
new
moon
had
disappeared
profound
darkness
enveloped
the
island
and
the
sea
no
light
could
pierce
through
the
heavy
piles
of
clouds
on
the
horizon
the
wind
had
died
away
completely
with
the
twilight
not
a
leaf
rustled
on
the

not
a

on
the
shore
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
ship
all
her
lights
being
extinguished
and
if
she
was
still
in
sight
of
the

her
whereabouts
could
not
be
discovered
well
who
knows
said
pencroft
perhaps
that
cursed
craft
will
stand
off
during
the
night
and
we
shall
see
nothing
of
her
at
daybreak

if
in
reply
to
the
sailors
observation
a
bright
light
flashed
in
the
darkness
and
a
cannonshot
was
heard
the

was
still
there
and
had
guns
on
board
six
seconds
elapsed
between
the
flash
and
the

therefore
the

was
about
a
mile
and
a
quarter
from
the
coast
at
the

time
the
chains
were
heard
rattling
through
the

the

had
just
anchored
in

of

chapter

there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
as
to
the
pirates
intentions
they
had
dropped
anchor
at
a
short
distance
from
the
island
and
it
was
evident
that
the
next
day
by
means
of
their
boats
they
purposed
to
land
on
the
beach
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
were
ready
to
act
but
determined
though
they
were
they
must
not
forget
to
be
prudent
perhaps
their
presence
might
still
be
concealed
in
the
event
of
the
pirates
contenting
themselves
with
landing
on
the
shore
without
examining
the
interior
of
the
island
it
might
be
indeed
that
their
only
intention
was
to
obtain
fresh
water
from
the
mercy
and
it
was
not
impossible
that
the
bridge
thrown
across
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
mouth
and
the
manufactory
at
the
chimneys
might
escape
their
notice
but
why
was
that
flag
hoisted
at
the
brigs
peak
what
was
that
shot
fired
for
pure
bravado
doubtless
unless
it
was
a
sign
of
the
act
of
taking
possession
harding
knew
now
that
the
vessel
was
well
armed
and
what
had
the
colonists
of
lincoln
island
to
reply
to
the
pirates
guns
a
few
muskets
only
however
observed
cyrus
harding
here
we
are
in
an
impregnable
position
the
enemy
cannot
discover
the
mouth
of
the
outlet
now
that
it
is
hidden
under
reeds
and
grass
and
consequently
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
penetrate
into
granite
house
but
our
plantations
our
poultryyard
our
corral
all
everything
exclaimed
pencroft
stamping
his
foot
they
may
spoil
everything
destroy
everything
in
a
few
hours
everything
pencroft
answered
harding
and
we
have
no
means
of
preventing
them
are
they
numerous
that
is
the
question
said
the
reporter
if
they
are
not
more
than
a
dozen
we
shall
be
able
to
stop
them
but
forty
fifty
more
perhaps
captain
harding
then
said
ayrton
advancing
towards
the
engineer
will
you
give
me
leave
for
what
my
friend
to
go
to
that
vessel
to
find
out
the
strength
of
her
crew
but
ayrton
answered
the
engineer
hesitating
you
will
risk
your
life
why
not
sir
that
is
more
than
your
duty
i
have
more
than
my
duty
to
do
replied
ayrton
will
you
go
to
the
ship
in
the
boat
asked
gideon
spilett
no
sir
but
i
will
swim
a
boat
would
be
seen
where
a
man
may
glide
between
wind
and
water
do
you
know
that
the
brig
is
a
mile
and
a
quarter
from
the
shore
said
herbert
i
am
a
good
swimmer
mr
herbert
i
tell
you
it
is
risking
your
life
said
the
engineer
that
is
no
matter
answered
ayrton
captain
harding
i
ask
this
as
a
favor
perhaps
it
will
be
a
means
of
raising
me
in
my
own
eyes
go
ayrton
replied
the
engineer
who
felt
sure
that
a
refusal
would
have
deeply
wounded
the
former
convict
now
become
an
honest
man
i
will
accompany
you
said
pencroft
you
mistrust
me
said
ayrton
quickly
then
more
humbly
alas
no
no
exclaimed
harding
with
animation
no
ayrton
pencroft
does
not
mistrust
you
you
interpret
his
words
wrongly
indeed
returned
the
sailor
i
only
propose
to
accompany
ayrton
as
far
as
the
islet
it
may
be
although
it
is
scarcely
possible
that
one
of
these
villains
has
landed
and
in
that
case
two
men
will
not
be
too
many
to
hinder
him
from
giving
the
alarm
i
will
wait
for
ayrton
on
the
islet
and
he
shall
go
alone
to
the
vessel
since
he
has
proposed
to
do
so
these
things
agreed
to
ayrton
made
preparations
for
his
departure
his
plan
was
bold
but
it
might
succeed
thanks
to
the
darkness
of
the
night
once
arrived
at
the
vessels
side
ayrton
holding
on
to
the
main
chains
might
reconnoiter
the
number
and
perhaps
overhear
the
intentions
of
the
pirates
ayrton
and
pencroft
followed
by
their
companions
descended
to
the
beach
ayrton
undressed
and
rubbed
himself
with
grease
so
as
to
suffer
less
from
the
temperature
of
the
water
which
was
still
cold
he
might
indeed
be
obliged
to
remain
in
it
for
several
hours
pencroft
and
neb
during
this
time
had
gone
to
fetch
the
boat
moored
a
few
hundred
feet
higher
up
on
the
bank
of
the
mercy
and
by
the
time
they
returned
ayrton
was
ready
to
start
a
coat
was
thrown
over
his
shoulders
and
the
settlers
all
came
round
him
to
press
his
hand
ayrton
then
shoved
off
with
pencroft
in
the
boat
it
was
halfpast
ten
in
the
evening
when
the
two
adventurers
disappeared
in
the
darkness
their
companions
returned
to
wait
at
the
chimneys
the
channel
was
easily
traversed
and
the
boat
touched
the
opposite
shore
of
the
islet
this
was
not
done
without
precaution
for
fear
lest
the
pirates
might
be
roaming
about
there
but
after
a
careful
survey
it
was
evident
that
the
islet
was
deserted
ayrton
then
followed
by
pencroft
crossed
it
with
a
rapid
step
scaring
the
birds
nestled
in
the
holes
of
the
rocks
then
without
hesitating
he
plunged
into
the
sea
and
swam
noiselessly
in
the
direction
of
the
ship
in
which
a
few
lights
had
recently
appeared
showing
her
exact
situation
as
to
pencroft
he
crouched
down
in
a
cleft
of
the
rock
and
awaited
the
return
of
his
companion
in
the
meanwhile
ayrton
swimming
with
a
vigorous
stroke
glided
through
the
sheet
of
water
without
producing
the
slightest
ripple
his
head
just
emerged
above
it
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
dark
hull
of
the
brig
from
which
the
lights
were
reflected
in
the
water
he
thought
only
of
the
duty
which
he
had
promised
to
accomplish
and
nothing
of
the
danger
which
he
ran
not
only
on
board
the
ship
but
in
the
sea
often
frequented
by
sharks
the
current
bore
him
along
and
he
rapidly
receded
from
the
shore
half
an
hour
afterwards
ayrton
without
having
been
either
seen
or
heard
arrived
at
the
ship
and
caught
hold
of
the
mainchains
he
took
breath
then
hoisting
himself
up
he
managed
to
reach
the
extremity
of
the
cutwater
there
were
drying
several
pairs
of
sailors
trousers
he
put
on
a
pair
then
settling
himself
firmly
he
listened
they
were
not
sleeping
on
board
the
brig
on
the
contrary
they
were
talking
singing
laughing
and
these
were
the
sentences
accompanied
with
oaths
which
principally
struck
ayrton
our
brig
is
a
famous
acquisition
she
sails
well
and
merits
her
name
of
the
speedy
she
would
show
all
the
navy
of
norfolk
a
clean
pair
of
heels
hurrah
for
her
captain
hurrah
for
bob
harvey
what
ayrton
felt
when
he
overheard
this
fragment
of
conversation
may
be
understood
when
it
is
known
that
in
this
bob
harvey
he
recognized
one
of
his
old
australian
companions
a
daring
sailor
who
had
continued
his
criminal
career
bob
harvey
had
seized
on
the
shores
of
norfolk
island
this
brig
which
was
loaded
with
arms
ammunition
utensils
and
tools
of
all
sorts
destined
for
one
of
the
sandwich
islands
all
his
gang
had
gone
on
board
and
pirates
after
having
been
convicts
these
wretches
more
ferocious
than
the
malays
themselves
scoured
the
pacific
destroying
vessels
and
massacring
their
crews
the
convicts
spoke
loudly
they
recounted
their
deeds
drinking
deeply
at
the
same
time
and
this
is
what
ayrton
gathered
the
actual
crew
of
the
speedy
was
composed
solely
of
english
prisoners
escaped
from
norfolk
island
here
it
may
be
well
to
explain
what
this
island
was
in
29deg
2
south
latitude
and
165deg
42
east
longitude
to
the
east
of
australia
is
found
a
little
island
six
miles
in
circumference
overlooked
by
mount
pitt
which
rises
to
a
height
of
1100
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
this
is
norfolk
island
once
the
seat
of
an
establishment
in
which
were
lodged
the
most
intractable
convicts
from
the
english
penitentiaries
they
numbered
500
under
an
iron
discipline
threatened
with
terrible
punishments
and
were
guarded
by
150
soldiers
and
150
employed
under
the
orders
of
the
governor
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
collection
of
greater
ruffians
sometimesalthough
very
rarelynotwithstanding
the
extreme
surveillance
of
which
they
were
the
object
many
managed
to
escape
and
seizing
vessels
which
they
surprised
they
infested
the
polynesian
archipelagoes
thus
had
bob
harvey
and
his
companions
done
thus
had
ayrton
formerly
wished
to
do
bob
harvey
had
seized
the
brig
speedy
anchored
in
sight
of
norfolk
island
the
crew
had
been
massacred
and
for
a
year
this
ship
had
scoured
the
pacific
under
the
command
of
harvey
now
a
pirate
and
well
known
to
ayrton
the
convicts
were
for
the
most
part
assembled
under
the
poop
but
a
few
stretched
on
the
deck
were
talking
loudly
the
conversation
still
continued
amid
shouts
and
libations
ayrton
learned
that
chance
alone
had
brought
the
speedy
in
sight
of
lincoln
island
bob
harvey
had
never
yet
set
foot
on
it
but
as
cyrus
harding
had
conjectured
finding
this
unknown
land
in
his
course
its
position
being
marked
on
no
chart
he
had
formed
the
project
of
visiting
it
and
if
he
found
it
suitable
of
making
it
the
brigs
headquarters
as
to
the
black
flag
hoisted
at
the
speedys
peak
and
the
gun
which
had
been
fired
in
imitation
of
menofwar
when
they
lower
their
colors
it
was
pure
piratical
bravado
it
was
in
no
way
a
signal
and
no
communication
yet
existed
between
the
convicts
and
lincoln
island
the
settlers
domain
was
now
menaced
with
terrible
danger
evidently
the
island
with
its
water
its
harbor
its
resources
of
all
kinds
so
increased
in
value
by
the
colonists
and
the
concealment
afforded
by
granite
house
could
not
but
be
convenient
for
the
convicts
in
their
hands
it
would
become
an
excellent
place
of
refuge
and
being
unknown
it
would
assure
them
for
a
long
time
perhaps
impunity
and
security
evidently
also
the
lives
of
the
settlers
would
not
be
respected
and
bob
harvey
and
his
accomplices
first
care
would
be
to
massacre
them
without
mercy
harding
and
his
companions
had
therefore
not
even
the
choice
of
flying
and
hiding
themselves
in
the
island
since
the
convicts
intended
to
reside
there
and
since
in
the
event
of
the
speedy
departing
on
an
expedition
it
was
probable
that
some
of
the
crew
would
remain
on
shore
so
as
to
settle
themselves
there
therefore
it
would
be
necessary
to
fight
to
destroy
every
one
of
these
scoundrels
unworthy
of
pity
and
against
whom
any
means
would
be
right
so
thought
ayrton
and
he
well
knew
that
cyrus
harding
would
be
of
his
way
of
thinking
but
was
resistance
and
in
the
last
place
victory
possible
that
would
depend
on
the
equipment
of
the
brig
and
the
number
of
men
which
she
carried
this
ayrton
resolved
to
learn
at
any
cost
and
as
an
hour
after
his
arrival
the
vociferations
had
begun
to
die
away
and
as
a
large
number
of
the
convicts
were
already
buried
in
a
drunken
sleep
ayrton
did
not
hesitate
to
venture
onto
the
speedys
deck
which
the
extinguished
lanterns
now
left
in
total
darkness
he
hoisted
himself
onto
the
cutwater
and
by
the
bowsprit
arrived
at
the
forecastle
then
gliding
among
the
convicts
stretched
here
and
there
he
made
the
round
of
the
ship
and
found
that
the
speedy
carried
four
guns
which
would
throw
shot
of
from
eight
to
ten
pounds
in
weight
he
found
also
on
touching
them
that
these
guns
were
breechloaders
they
were
therefore
of
modern
make
easily
used
and
of
terrible
effect
as
to
the
men
lying
on
the
deck
they
were
about
ten
in
number
but
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
more
were
sleeping
down
below
besides
by
listening
to
them
ayrton
had
understood
that
there
were
fifty
on
board
that
was
a
large
number
for
the
six
settlers
of
lincoln
island
to
contend
with
but
now
thanks
to
ayrtons
devotion
cyrus
harding
would
not
be
surprised
he
would
know
the
strength
of
his
adversaries
and
would
make
his
arrangements
accordingly
there
was
nothing
more
for
ayrton
to
do
but
to
return
and
render
to
his
companions
an
account
of
the
mission
with
which
he
had
charged
himself
and
he
prepared
to
regain
the
bows
of
the
brig
so
that
he
might
let
himself
down
into
the
water
but
to
this
man
whose
wish
was
as
he
had
said
to
do
more
than
his
duty
there
came
an
heroic
thought
this
was
to
sacrifice
his
own
life
but
save
the
island
and
the
colonists
cyrus
harding
evidently
could
not
resist
fifty
ruffians
all
well
armed
who
either
by
penetrating
by
main
force
into
granite
house
or
by
starving
out
the
besieged
could
obtain
from
them
what
they
wanted
and
then
he
thought
of
his
preserversthose
who
had
made
him
again
a
man
and
an
honest
mm
those
to
whom
he
owed
allmurdered
without
pity
their
works
destroyed
their
island
turned
into
a
pirates
den
he
said
to
himself
that
he
ayrton
was
the
principal
cause
of
so
many
disasters
since
his
old
companion
bob
harvey
had
but
realized
his
own
plans
and
a
feeling
of
horror
took
possession
of
him
then
he
was
seized
with
an
irresistible
desire
to
blow
up
the
brig
and
with
her
all
whom
she
had
on
board
he
would
perish
in
the
explosion
but
he
would
have
done
his
duty
ayrton
did
not
hesitate
to
reach
the
powderroom
which
is
always
situated
in
the
afterpart
of
a
vessel
was
easy
there
would
be
no
want
of
powder
in
a
vessel
which
followed
such
a
trade
and
a
spark
would
be
enough
to
destroy
it
in
an
instant
ayrton
stole
carefully
along
the
betweendecks
strewn
with
numerous
sleepers
overcome
more
by
drunkenness
than
sleep
a
lantern
was
lighted
at
the
foot
of
the
mainmast
round
which
was
hung
a
gunrack
furnished
with
weapons
of
all
sorts
ayrton
took
a
revolver
from
the
rack
and
assured
himself
that
it
was
loaded
and
primed
nothing
more
was
needed
to
accomplish
the
work
of
destruction
he
then
glided
towards
the
stern
so
as
to
arrive
under
the
brigs
poop
at
the
powdermagazine
it
was
difficult
to
proceed
along
the
dimly
lighted
deck
without
stumbling
over
some
halfsleeping
convict
who
retorted
by
oaths
and
kicks
ayrton
was
therefore
more
than
once
obliged
to
halt
but
at
last
he
arrived
at
the
partition
dividing
the
aftercabin
and
found
the
door
opening
into
the
magazine
itself
ayrton
compelled
to
force
it
open
set
to
work
it
was
a
difficult
operation
to
perform
without
noise
for
he
had
to
break
a
padlock
but
under
his
vigorous
hand
the
padlock
broke
and
the
door
was
open
at
that
moment
a
hand
was
laid
on
ayrtons
shoulder
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
a
tall
man
in
a
harsh
voice
who
standing
in
the
shadow
quickly
threw
the
light
of
a
lantern
in
ayrtons
face
ayrton
drew
back
in
the
rapid
flash
of
the
lantern
he
had
recognized
his
former
accomplice
bob
harvey
who
could
not
have
known
him
as
he
must
have
thought
ayrton
long
since
dead
what
are
you
doing
here
again
said
bob
harvey
seizing
ayrton
by
the
waistband
but
ayrton
without
replying
wrenched
himself
from
his
grasp
and
attempted
to
rush
into
the
magazine
a
shot
fired
into
the
midst
of
the
powdercasks
and
all
would
be
over
help
lads
shouted
bob
harvey
at
his
shout
two
or
three
pirates
awoke
jumped
up
and
rushing
on
ayrton
endeavored
to
throw
him
down
he
soon
extricated
himself
from
their
grasp
he
fired
his
revolver
and
two
of
the
convicts
fell
but
a
blow
from
a
knife
which
he
could
not
ward
off
made
a
gash
in
his
shoulder
ayrton
perceived
that
he
could
no
longer
hope
to
carry
out
his
project
bob
harvey
had
reclosed
the
door
of
the
powdermagazine
and
a
movement
on
the
deck
indicated
a
general
awakening
of
the
pirates
ayrton
must
reserve
himself
to
fight
at
the
side
of
cyrus
harding
there
was
nothing
for
him
but
flight
but
was
flight
still
possible
it
was
doubtful
yet
ayrton
resolved
to
dare
everything
in
order
to
rejoin
his
companions
four
barrels
of
the
revolver
were
still
undischarged
two
were
firedone
aimed
at
bob
harvey
did
not
wound
him
or
at
any
rate
only
slightly
and
ayrton
profiting
by
the
momentary
retreat
of
his
adversaries
rushed
towards
the
companionladder
to
gain
the
deck
passing
before
the
lantern
he
smashed
it
with
a
blow
from
the
butt
of
his
revolver
a
profound
darkness
ensued
which
favored
his
flight
two
or
three
pirates
awakened
by
the
noise
were
descending
the
ladder
at
the
same
moment
a
fifth
shot
from
ayrton
laid
one
low
and
the
others
drew
back
not
understanding
what
was
going
on
ayrton
was
on
deck
in
two
bounds
and
three
seconds
later
having
discharged
his
last
barrel
in
the
face
of
a
pirate
who
was
about
to
seize
him
by
the
throat
he
leaped
over
the
bulwarks
into
the
sea
ayrton
had
not
made
six
strokes
before
shots
were
splashing
around
him
like
hail

under

the
reporter
herbert
and
neb
crouched
in
the
chimneys
when
they
heard
the
reports
on
board
the
brig
they
rushed
out
on
to
the
beach
and
their
guns
shouldered
they
stood
ready
to
repel
any
attack
they
had
no
doubt
about
it
themselves
ayrton
surprised
by
the
pirates
had
been
murdered
and
perhaps
the
wretches
would
profit
by
the
night
to
make
a
descent
on
the
island
half
an
hour
was
passed
in
terrible
anxiety
the
firing
had
ceased
and
yet
neither
ayrton
nor
pencroft
had
reappeared
was
the
islet
invaded
ought
they
not
to
fly
to
the
help
of
ayrton
and
pencroft
but
how
the
tide
being
high
at
that
time
rendered
the
channel
impassable
the
boat
was
not
there
we
may
imagine
the
horrible
anxiety
which
took
possession
of
harding
and
his
companions
at
last
towards
halfpast
twelve
a
boat
carrying
two
men
touched
the
beach
it
was
ayrton
slightly
wounded
in
the
shoulder
and
pencroft
safe
and
sound
whom
their
friends
received
with
open
arms
all
immediately
took
refuge
in
the
chimneys
there
ayrton
recounted
all
that
had
passed
even
to
his
plan
for
blowing
up
the
brig
which
he
had
attempted

put
into
execution
all

extended
to

from

chapter
3
the
night
passed
without
incident
the
colonists
were
on
the
qui
vive
and
did
not
leave
their
post
at
the
chimneys
the
pirates
on
their
side
did
not
appear
to
have
made
any
attempt
to
land
since
the
last
shots
fired
at
ayrton
not
a
report
not
even
a
sound
had
betrayed
the
presence
of
the
brig
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
island
it
might
have
been
fancied
that
she
had
weighed
anchor
thinking
that
she
had
to
deal
with
her
match
and
had
left
the
coast
but
it
was
no
such
thing
and
when
day
began
to
dawn
the
settlers
could
see
a
confused
mass
through
the
morning
mist
it
was
the
speedy
these
my
friends
said
the
engineer
are
the
arrangements
which
appear
to
me
best
to
make
before
the
fog
completely
clears
away
it
hides
us
from
the
eyes
of
the
pirates
and
we
can
act
without
attracting
their
attention
the
most
important
thing
is
that
the
convicts
should
believe
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
are
numerous
and
consequently
capable
of
resisting
them
i
therefore
propose
that
we
divide
into
three
parties
the
first
of
which
shall
be
posted
at
the
chimneys
the
second
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
as
to
the
third
i
think
it
would
be
best
to
place
it
on
the
islet
so
as
to
prevent
or
at
all
events
delay
any
attempt
at
landing
we
have
the
use
of
two
rifles
and
four
muskets
each
of
us
will
be
armed
and
as
we
are
amply
provided
with
powder
and
shot
we
need
not
spare
our
fire
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
muskets
nor
even
from
the
guns
of
the
brig
what
can
they
do
against
these
rocks
and
as
we
shall
not
fire
from
the
windows
of
granite
house
the
pirates
will
not
think
of
causing
irreparable
damage
by
throwing
shell
against
it
what
is
to
be
feared
is
the
necessity
of
meeting
handtohand
since
the
convicts
have
numbers
on
their
side
we
must
therefore
try
to
prevent
them
from
landing
but
without
discovering
ourselves
therefore
do
not
economize
the
ammunition
fire
often
but
with
a
sure
aim
we
have
each
eight
or
ten
enemies
to
kill
and
they
must
be
killed
cyrus
harding
had
clearly
represented
their
situation
although
he
spoke
in
the
calmest
voice
as
if
it
was
a
question
of
directing
a
piece
of
work
and
not
ordering
a
battle
his
companions
approved
these
arrangements
without
even
uttering
a
word
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
but
for
each
to
take
his
place
before
the
fog
should
be
completely
dissipated
neb
and
pencroft
immediately
ascended
to
granite
house
and
brought
back
a
sufficient
quantity
of
ammunition
gideon
spilett
and
ayrton
both
very
good
marksmen
were
armed
with
the
two
rifles
which
carried
nearly
a
mile
the
four
other
muskets
were
divided
among
harding
neb
pencroft
and
herbert
the
posts
were
arranged
in
the
following
manner
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
remained
in
ambush
at
the
chimneys
thus
commanding
the
shore
to
the
foot
of
granite
house
gideon
spilett
and
neb
crouched
among
the
rocks
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
from
which
the
drawbridges
had
been
raised
so
as
to
prevent
any
one
from
crossing
in
a
boat
or
landing
on
the
opposite
shore
as
to
ayrton
and
pencroft
they
shoved
off
in
the
boat
and
prepared
to
cross
the
channel
and
to
take
up
two
separate
stations
on
the
islet
in
this
way
shots
being
fired
from
four
different
points
at
once
the
convicts
would
be
led
to
believe
that
the
island
was
both
largely
peopled
and
strongly
defended
in
the
event
of
a
landing
being
effected
without
their
having
been
able
to
prevent
it
and
also
if
they
saw
that
they
were
on
the
point
of
being
cut
off
by
the
brigs
boat
ayrton
and
pencroft
were
to
return
in
their
boat
to
the
shore
and
proceed
towards
the
threatened
spot
before
starting
to
occupy
their
posts
the
colonists
for
the
last
time
wrung
each
others
hands
pencroft
succeeded
in
controlling
himself
sufficiently
to
suppress
his
emotion
when
he
embraced
herbert
his
boy
and
then
they
separated
in
a
few
moments
harding
and
herbert
on
one
side
the
reporter
and
neb
on
the
other
had
disappeared
behind
the
rocks
and
five
minutes
later
ayrton
and
pencroft
having
without
difficulty
crossed
the
channel
disembarked
on
the
islet
and
concealed
themselves
in
the
clefts
of
its
eastern
shore
none
of
them
could
have
been
seen
for
they
themselves
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
brig
in
the
fog
it
was
halfpast
six
in
the
morning
soon
the
fog
began
to
clear
away
and
the
topmasts
of
the
brig
issued
from
the
vapor
for
some
minutes
great
masses
rolled
over
the
surface
of
the
sea
then
a
breeze
sprang
up
which
rapidly
dispelled
the
mist
the
speedy
now
appeared
in
full
view
with
a
spring
on
her
cable
her
head
to
the
north
presenting
her
larboard
side
to
the
island
just
as
harding
had
calculated
she
was
not
more
than
a
mile
and
a
quarter
from
the
coast
the
sinister
black
flag
floated
from
the
peak
the
engineer
with
his
telescope
could
see
that
the
four
guns
on
board
were
pointed
at
the
island
they
were
evidently
ready
to
fire
at
a
moments
notice
in
the
meanwhile
the
speedy
remained
silent
about
thirty
pirates
could
be
seen
moving
on
the
deck
a
few
more
on
the
poop
two
others
posted
in
the
shrouds
and
armed
with
spyglasses
were
attentively
surveying
the
island
certainly
bob
harvey
and
his
crew
would
not
be
able
easily
to
give
an
account
of
what
had
happened
during
the
night
on
board
the
brig
had
this
halfnaked
man
who
had
forced
the
door
of
the
powdermagazine
and
with
whom
they
had
struggled
who
had
six
times
discharged
his
revolver
at
them
who
had
killed
one
and
wounded
two
others
escaped
their
shot
had
he
been
able
to
swim
to
shore
whence
did
he
come
what
had
been
his
object
had
his
design
really
been
to
blow
up
the
brig
as
bob
harvey
had
thought
all
this
must
be
confused
enough
to
the
convicts
minds
but
what
they
could
no
longer
doubt
was
that
the
unknown
island
before
which
the
speedy
had
cast
anchor
was
inhabited
and
that
there
was
perhaps
a
numerous
colony
ready
to
defend
it
and
yet
no
one
was
to
be
seen
neither
on
the
shore
nor
on
the
heights
the
beach
appeared
to
be
absolutely
deserted
at
any
rate
there
was
no
trace
of
dwellings
had
the
inhabitants
fled
into
the
interior
thus
probably
the
pirate
captain
reasoned
and
doubtless
like
a
prudent
man
he
wished
to
reconnoiter
the
locality
before
he
allowed
his
men
to
venture
there
during
an
hour
and
a
half
no
indication
of
attack
or
landing
could
be
observed
on
board
the
brig
evidently
bob
harvey
was
hesitating
even
with
his
strongest
telescopes
he
could
not
have
perceived
one
of
the
settlers
crouched
among
the
rocks
it
was
not
even
probable
that
his
attention
had
been
awakened
by
the
screen
of
green
branches
and
creepers
hiding
the
windows
of
granite
house
and
showing
rather
conspicuously
on
the
bare
rock
indeed
how
could
he
imagine
that
a
dwelling
was
hollowed
out
at
that
height
in
the
solid
granite
from
claw
cape
to
the
mandible
capes
in
all
the
extent
of
union
bay
there
was
nothing
to
lead
him
to
suppose
that
the
island
was
or
could
be
inhabited
at
eight
oclock
however
the
colonists
observed
a
movement
on
board
the
speedy
a
boat
was
lowered
and
seven
men
jumped
into
her
they
were
armed
with
muskets
one
took
the
yokelines
four
others
the
oars
and
the
two
others
kneeling
in
the
bows
ready
to
fire
reconnoitered
the
island
their
object
was
no
doubt
to
make
an
examination
but
not
to
land
for
in
the
latter
case
they
would
have
come
in
larger
numbers
the
pirates
from
their
lookout
could
have
seen
that
the
coast
was
sheltered
by
an
islet
separated
from
it
by
a
channel
half
a
mile
in
width
however
it
was
soon
evident
to
cyrus
harding
on
observing
the
direction
followed
by
the
boat
that
they
would
not
attempt
to
penetrate
into
the
channel
but
would
land
on
the
islet
pencroft
and
ayrton
each
hidden
in
a
narrow
cleft
of
the
rock
saw
them
coming
directly
towards
them
and
waited
till
they
were
within
range
the
boat
advanced
with
extreme
caution
the
oars
only
dipped
into
the
water
at
long
intervals
it
could
now
be
seen
that
one
of
the
convicts
held
a
leadline
in
his
hand
and
that
he
wished
to
fathom
the
depth
of
the
channel
hollowed
out
by
the
current
of
the
mercy
this
showed
that
it
was
bob
harveys
intention
to
bring
his
brig
as
near
as
possible
to
the
coast
about
thirty
pirates
scattered
in
the
rigging
followed
every
movement
of
the
boat
and
took
the
bearings
of
certain
landmarks
which
would
allow
them
to
approach
without
danger
the
boat
was
not
more
than
two
cableslengths
off
the
islet
when
she
stopped
the
man
at
the
tiller
stood
up
and
looked
for
the
best
place
at
which
to
land
at
that
moment
two
shots
were
heard
smoke
curled
up
from
among
the
rocks
of
the
islet
the
man
at
the
helm
and
the
man
with
the
leadline
fell
backwards
into
the
boat
ayrtons
and
pencrofts
balls
had
struck
them
both
at
the
same
moment
almost
immediately
a
louder
report
was
heard
a
cloud
of
smoke
issued
from
the
brigs
side
and
a
ball
striking
the
summit
of
the
rock
which
sheltered
ayrton
and
pencroft
made
it
fly
in
splinters
but
the
two
marksmen
remained
unhurt
horrible
imprecations
burst
from
the
boat
which
immediately
continued
its
way
the
man
who
had
been
at
the
tiller
was
replaced
by
one
of
his
comrades
and
the
oars
were
rapidly
plunged
into
the
water
however
instead
of
returning
on
board
as
might
have
been
expected
the
boat
coasted
along
the
islet
so
as
to
round
its
southern
point
the
pirates
pulled
vigorously
at
their
oars
that
they
might
get
out
of
range
of
the
bullets
they
advanced
to
within
five
cableslengths
of
that
part
of
the
shore
terminated
by
flotsam
point
and
after
having
rounded
it
in
a
semicircular
line
still
protected
by
the
brigs
guns
they
proceeded
towards
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
their
evident
intention
was
to
penetrate
into
the
channel
and
cut
off
the
colonists
posted
on
the
islet
in
such
a
way
that
whatever
their
number
might
be
being
placed
between
the
fire
from
the
boat
and
the
fire
from
the
brig
they
would
find
themselves
in
a
very
disadvantageous
position
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
while
the
boat
advanced
in
this
direction
absolute
silence
perfect
calm
reigned
in
the
air
and
on
the
water
pencroft
and
ayrton
although
they
knew
they
ran
the
risk
of
being
cut
off
had
not
left
their
post
both
that
they
did
not
wish
to
show
themselves
as
yet
to
their
assailants
and
expose
themselves
to
the
speedys
guns
and
that
they
relied
on
neb
and
gideon
spilett
watching
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
on
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
in
ambush
among
the
rocks
at
the
chimneys
twenty
minutes
after
the
first
shots
were
fired
the
boat
was
less
than
two
cableslengths
off
the
mercy
as
the
tide
was
beginning
to
rise
with
its
accustomed
violence
caused
by
the
narrowness
of
the
straits
the
pirates
were
drawn
towards
the
river
and
it
was
only
by
dint
of
hard
rowing
that
they
were
able
to
keep
in
the
middle
of
the
channel
but
as
they
were
passing
within
good
range
of
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
two
balls
saluted
them
and
two
more
of
their
number
were
laid
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
neb
and
spilett
had
not
missed
their
aim
the
brig
immediately
sent
a
second
ball
on
the
post
betrayed
by
the
smoke
but
without
any
other
result
than
that
of
splintering
the
rock
the
boat
now
contained
only
three
able
men
carried
on
by
the
current
it
shot
through
the
channel
with
the
rapidity
of
an
arrow
passed
before
harding
and
herbert
who
not
thinking
it
within
range
withheld
their
fire
then
rounding
the
northern
point
of
the
islet
with
the
two
remaining
oars
they
pulled
towards
the
brig
hitherto
the
settlers
had
nothing
to
complain
of
their
adversaries
had
certainly
had
the
worst
of
it
the
latter
already
counted
four
men
seriously
wounded
if
not
dead
they
on
the
contrary
unwounded
had
not
missed
a
shot
if
the
pirates
continued
to
attack
them
in
this
way
if
they
renewed
their
attempt
to
land
by
means
of
a
boat
they
could
be
destroyed
one
by
one
it
was
now
seen
how
advantageous
the
engineers
arrangements
had
been
the
pirates
would
think
that
they
had
to
deal
with
numerous
and
wellarmed
adversaries
whom
they
could
not
easily
get
the
better
of
half
an
hour
passed
before
the
boat
having
to
pull
against
the
current
could
get
alongside
the
speedy
frightful
cries
were
heard
when
they
returned
on
board
with
the
wounded
and
two
or
three
guns
were
fired
with
no
results
but
now
about
a
dozen
other
convicts
maddened
with
rage
and
possibly
by
the
effect
of
the
evenings
potations
threw
themselves
into
the
boat
a
second
boat
was
also
lowered
in
which
eight
men
took
their
places
and
while
the
first
pulled
straight
for
the
islet
to
dislodge
the
colonists
from
thence
the
second
maneuvered
so
as
to
force
the
entrance
of
the
mercy
the
situation
was
evidently
becoming
very
dangerous
for
pencroft
and
ayrton
and
they
saw
that
they
must
regain
the
mainland
however
they
waited
till
the
first
boat
was
within
range
when
two
welldirected
balls
threw
its
crew
into
disorder
then
pencroft
and
ayrton
abandoning
their
posts
under
fire
from
the
dozen
muskets
ran
across
the
islet
at
full
speed
jumped
into
their
boat
crossed
the
channel
at
the
moment
the
second
boat
reached
the
southern
end
and
ran
to
hide
themselves
in
the
chimneys
they
had
scarcely
rejoined
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
before
the
islet
was
overrun
with
pirates
in
every
direction
almost
at
the
same
moment
fresh
reports
resounded
from
the
mercy
station
to
which
the
second
boat
was
rapidly
approaching
two
out
of
the
eight
men
who
manned
her
were
mortally
wounded
by
gideon
spilett
and
neb
and
the
boat
herself
carried
irresistibly
onto
the
reefs
was
stove
in
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
but
the
six
survivors
holding
their
muskets
above
their
heads
to
preserve
them
from
contact
with
the
water
managed
to
land
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
then
finding
they
were
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
ambush
there
they
fled
in
the
direction
of
flotsam
point
out
of
range
of
the
balls
the
actual
situation
was
this
on
the
islet
were
a
dozen
convicts
of
whom
some
were
no
doubt
wounded
but
who
had
still
a
boat
at
their
disposal
on
the
island
were
six
but
who
could
not
by
any
possibility
reach
granite
house
as
they
could
not
cross
the
river
all
the
bridges
being
raised
hallo
exclaimed
pencroft
as
he
rushed
into
the
chimneys
hallo
captain
what
do
you
think
of
it
now
i
think
answered
the
engineer
that
the
combat
will
now
take
a
new
form
for
it
cannot
be
supposed
that
the
convicts
will
be
so
foolish
as
to
remain
in
a
position
so
unfavorable
for
them
they
wont
cross
the
channel
said
the
sailor
ayrton
and
mr
spiletts
rifles
are
there
to
prevent
them
you
know
that
they
carry
more
than
a
mile
no
doubt
replied
herbert
but
what
can
two
rifles
do
against
the
brigs
guns
well
the
brig
isnt
in
the
channel
yet
i
fancy
said
pencroft
but
suppose
she
does
come
there
said
harding
thats
impossible
for
she
would
risk
running
aground
and
being
lost
it
is
possible
said
ayrton
the
convicts
might
profit
by
the
high
tide
to
enter
the
channel
with
the
risk
of
grounding
at
low
tide
it
is
true
but
then
under
the
fire
from
her
guns
our
posts
would
be
no
longer
tenable
confound
them
exclaimed
pencroft
it
really
seems
as
if
the
blackguards
were
preparing
to
weigh
anchor
perhaps
we
shall
be
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
granite
house
observed
herbert
we
must
wait
answered
cyrus
harding
but
mr
spilett
and
neb
said
pencroft
they
will
know
when
it
is
best
to
rejoin
us
be
ready
ayrton
it
is
yours
and
spiletts
rifles
which
must
speak
now
it
was
only
too
true
the
speedy
was
beginning
to
weigh
her
anchor
and
her
intention
was
evidently
to
approach
the
islet
the
tide
would
be
rising
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
the
ebb
current
being
already
weakened
it
would
be
easy
for
the
brig
to
advance
but
as
to
entering
the
channel
pencroft
contrary
to
ayrtons
opinion
could
not
believe
that
she
would
dare
to
attempt
it
in
the
meanwhile
the
pirates
who
occupied
the
islet
had
gradually
advanced
to
the
opposite
shore
and
were
now
only
separated
from
the
mainland
by
the
channel
being
armed
with
muskets
alone
they
could
do
no
harm
to
the
settlers
in
ambush
at
the
chimneys
and
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
but
not
knowing
the
latter
to
be
supplied
with
longrange
rifles
they
on
their
side
did
not
believe
themselves
to
be
exposed
quite
uncovered
therefore
they
surveyed
the
islet
and
examined
the
shore
their
illusion
was
of
short
duration
ayrtons
and
gideon
spiletts
rifles
then
spoke
and
no
doubt
imparted
some
very
disagreeable
intelligence
to
two
of
the
convicts
for
they
fell
backwards
then
there
was
a
general
helterskelter
the
ten
others
not
even
stopping
to
pick
up
their
dead
or
wounded
companions
fled
to
the
other
side
of
the
islet
tumbled
into
the
boat
which
had
brought
them
and
pulled
away
with
all
their
strength
eight
less
exclaimed
pencroft
really
one
would
have
thought
that
mr
spilett
and
ayrton
had
given
the
word
to
fire
together
gentlemen
said
ayrton
as
he
reloaded
his
gun
this
is
becoming
more
serious
the
brig
is
making
sail
the
anchor
is
weighed
exclaimed
pencroft
yes
and
she
is
already
moving
in
fact
they
could
distinctly
hear
the
creaking
of
the
windlass
the
speedy
was
at
first
held
by
her
anchor
then
when
that
had
been
raised
she
began
to
drift
towards
the
shore
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
sea
the
jib
and
the
foretopsail
were
hoisted
and
the
vessel
gradually
approached
the
island
from
the
two
posts
of
the
mercy
and
the
chimneys
they
watched
her
without
giving
a
sign
of
life
but
not
without
some
emotion
what
could
be
more
terrible
for
the
colonists
than
to
be
exposed
at
a
short
distance
to
the
brigs
guns
without
being
able
to
reply
with
any
effect
how
could
they
then
prevent
the
pirates
from
landing
cyrus
harding
felt
this
strongly
and
he
asked
himself
what
it
would
be
possible
to
do
before
long
he
would
be
called
upon
for
his
determination
but
what
was
it
to
be
to
shut
themselves
up
in
granite
house
to
be
besieged
there
to
remain
there
for
weeks
for
months
even
since
they
had
an
abundance
of
provisions
so
far
good
but
after
that
the
pirates
would
not
the
less
be
masters
of
the
island
which
they
would
ravage
at
their
pleasure
and
in
time
they
would
end
by
having
their
revenge
on
the
prisoners
in
granite
house
however
one
chance
yet
remained
it
was
that
bob
harvey
after
all
would
not
venture
his
ship
into
the
channel
and
that
he
would
keep
outside
the
islet
he
would
be
still
separated
from
the
coast
by
half
a
mile
and
at
that
distance
his
shot
could
not
be
very
destructive
never
repeated
pencroft
bob
harvey
will
never
if
he
is
a
good
seaman
enter
that
channel
he
knows
well
that
it
would
risk
the
brig
if
the
sea
got
up
ever
so
little
and
what
would
become
of
him
without
his
vessel
in
the
meanwhile
the
brig
approached
the
islet
and
it
could
be
seen
that
she
was
endeavoring
to
make
the
lower
end
the
breeze
was
light
and
as
the
current
had
then
lost
much
of
its
force
bob
harvey
had
absolute
command
over
his
vessel
the
route
previously
followed
by
the
boats
had
allowed
her
to
reconnoiter
the
channel
and
she
boldly
entered
it
the
pirates
design
was
now
only
too
evident
he
wished
to
bring
her
broadside
to
bear
on
the
chimneys
and
from
there
to
reply
with
shell
and
ball
to
the
shot
which
had
till
then
decimated
her
crew
soon
the
speedy
reached
the
point
of
the
islet
she
rounded
it
with
ease
the
mainsail
was
braced
up
and
the
brig
hugging
the
wind
stood
across
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
the
scoundrels
they
are
coming
said
pencroft
at
that
moment
cyrus
harding
ayrton
the
sailor
and
herbert
were
rejoined
by
neb
and
gideon
spilett
the
reporter
and
his
companion
had
judged
it
best
to
abandon
the
post
at
the
mercy
from
which
they
could
do
nothing
against
the
ship
and
they
had
acted
wisely
it
was
better
that
the
colonists
should
be
together
at
the
moment
when
they
were
about
to
engage
in
a
decisive
action
gideon
spilett
and
neb
had
arrived
by
dodging
behind
the
rocks
though
not
without
attracting
a
shower
of
bullets
which
had
not
however
reached
them
spilett
neb
cried
the
engineer
you
are
not
wounded
no
answered
the
reporter
a
few
bruises
only
from
the
ricochet
but
that
cursed
brig
has
entered
the
channel
yes
replied
pencroft
and
in
ten
minutes
she
will
have
anchored
before
granite
house
have
you
formed
any
plan
cyrus
asked
the
reporter
we
must
take
refuge
in
granite
house
while
there
is
still
time
and
the
convicts
cannot
see
us
that
is
my
opinion
too
replied
gideon
spilett
but
once
shut
up
we
must
be
guided
by
circumstances
said
the
engineer
let
us
be
off
then
and
make
haste
said
the
reporter
would
you
not
wish
captain
that
ayrton
and
i
should
remain
here
asked
the
sailor
what
would
be
the
use
of
that
pencroft
replied
harding
no
we
will
not
separate
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
the
colonists
left
the
chimneys
a
bend
of
the
cliff
prevented
them
from
being
seen
by
those
in
the
brig
but
two
or
three
reports
and
the
crash
of
bullets
on
the
rock
told
them
that
the
speedy
was
at
no
great
distance
to
spring
into
the
lift
hoist
themselves
up
to
the
door
of
granite
house
where
top
and
jup
had
been
shut
up
since
the
evening
before
to
rush
into
the
large
room
was
the
work
of
a
minute
only
it
was
quite
time
for
the
settlers
through
the
branches
could
see
the
speedy
surrounded
with
smoke
gliding
up
the
channel
the
firing
was
incessant
and
shot
from
the
four
guns
struck
blindly
both
on
the
mercy
post
although
it
was
not
occupied
and
on
the
chimneys
the
rocks
were
splintered
and
cheers
accompanied
each
discharge
however
they
were
hoping
that
granite
house
would
be
spared
thanks
to
hardings
precaution
of
concealing
the
windows
when
a
shot
piercing
the
door
penetrated
into
the
passage
we
are
discovered
exclaimed
pencroft
the
colonists
had
not
perhaps
been
seen
but
it
was
certain
that
bob
harvey
had
thought
proper
to
send
a
ball
through
the
suspected
foliage
which
concealed
that
part
of
the
cliff
soon
he
redoubled
his
attack
when
another
ball
having
torn
away
the
leafy
screen
disclosed
a
gaping
aperture
in
the
granite
the
colonists
situation
was
desperate
their
retreat
was
discovered
they
could
not
oppose
any
obstacle
to
these
missiles
nor
protect
the
stone
which
flew
in
splinters
around
them
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
take
refuge
in
the
upper
passage
of
granite
house
and
leave
their
dwelling
to
be
devastated
when
a
deep
roar
was
heard
followed
by
frightful
cries
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
rushed
to
one
of
the
windows
the
brig
irresistibly
raised
on
a
sort
of
waterspout
had
just
split
in
two
and
in
less
than
ten
seconds
she
was
swallowed
up
with
all
her
criminal
crew
chapter
4
she
has
blown
up
cried
herbert
yes
blown
up
just
as
if
ayrton
had
set
fire
to
the
powder
returned
pencroft
throwing
himself
into
the
lift
together
with
neb
and
the
lad
but
what
has
happened
asked
gideon
spilett
quite
stunned
by
this
unexpected
catastrophe
oh
this
time
we
shall
know
answered
the
engineer
quickly
what
shall
we
know
later
later
come
spilett
the
main
point
is
that
these
pirates
have
been
exterminated
and
cyrus
harding
hurrying
away
the
reporter
and
ayrton
joined
pencroft
neb
and
herbert
on
the
beach
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
brig
not
even
her
masts
after
having
been
raised
by
the
waterspout
she
had
fallen
on
her
side
and
had
sunk
in
that
position
doubtless
in
consequence
of
some
enormous
leak
but
as
in
that
place
the
channel
was
not
more
than
twenty
feet
in
depth
it
was
certain
that
the
sides
of
the
submerged
brig
would
reappear
at
low
water
a
few
things
from
the
wreck
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
water
a
raft
could
be
seen
consisting
of
spare
spars
coops
of
poultry
with
their
occupants
still
living
boxes
and
barrels
which
gradually
came
to
the
surface
after
having
escaped
through
the
hatchways
but
no
pieces
of
the
wreck
appeared
neither
planks
from
the
deck
nor
timber
from
the
hullwhich
rendered
the
sudden
disappearance
of
the
speedy
perfectly
inexplicable
however
the
two
masts
which
had
been
broken
and
escaped
from
the
shrouds
and
stays
came
up
and
with
their
sails
some
furled
and
the
others
spread
but
it
was
not
necessary
to
wait
for
the
tide
to
bring
up
these
riches
and
ayrton
and
pencroft
jumped
into
the
boat
with
the
intention
of
towing
the
pieces
of
wreck
either
to
the
beach
or
to
the
islet
but
just
as
they
were
shoving
off
an
observation
from
gideon
spilett
arrested
them
what
about
those
six
convicts
who
disembarked
on
the
right
bank
of
the
mercy
said
he
in
fact
it
would
not
do
to
forget
that
the
six
men
whose
boat
had
gone
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
had
landed
at
flotsam
point
they
looked
in
that
direction
none
of
the
fugitives
were
visible
it
was
probable
that
having
seen
their
vessel
engulfed
in
the
channel
they
had
fled
into
the
interior
of
the
island
we
will
deal
with
them
later
said
harding
as
they
are
armed
they
will
still
be
dangerous
but
as
it
is
six
against
six
the
chances
are
equal
to
the
most
pressing
business
first
ayrton
and
pencroft
pulled
vigorously
towards
the
wreck
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
tide
very
high
as
there
had
been
a
new
moon
but
two
days
before
a
whole
hour
at
least
would
elapse
before
the
hull
of
the
brig
could
emerge
from
the
water
of
the
channel
ayrton
and
pencroft
were
able
to
fasten
the
masts
and
spars
by
means
of
ropes
the
ends
of
which
were
carried
to
the
beach
there
by
the
united
efforts
of
the
settlers
the
pieces
of
wreck
were
hauled
up
then
the
boat
picked
up
all
that
was
floating
coops
barrels
and
boxes
which
were
immediately
carried
to
the
chimneys
several
bodies
floated
also
among
them
ayrton
recognized
that
of
bob
harvey
which
he
pointed
out
to
his
companion
saying
with
some
emotion
that
is
what
i
have
been
pencroft
but
what
you
are
no
longer
brave
ayrton
returned
the
sailor
warmly
it
was
singular
enough
that
so
few
bodies
floated
only
five
or
six
were
counted
which
were
already
being
carried
by
the
current
towards
the
open
sea
very
probably
the
convicts
had
not
had
time
to
escape
and
the
ship
lying
over
on
her
side
the
greater
number
of
them
had
remained
below
now
the
current
by
carrying
the
bodies
of
these
miserable
men
out
to
sea
would
spare
the
colonists
the
sad
task
of
burying
them
in
some
corner
of
their
island
for
two
hours
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
were
solely
occupied
in
hauling
up
the
spars
on
to
the
sand
and
then
in
spreading
the
sails
which
were
perfectly
uninjured
to
dry
they
spoke
little
for
they
were
absorbed
in
their
work
but
what
thoughts
occupied
their
minds
the
possession
of
this
brig
or
rather
all
that
she
contained
was
a
perfect
mine
of
wealth
in
fact
a
ship
is
like
a
little
world
in
miniature
and
the
stores
of
the
colony
would
be
increased
by
a
large
number
of
useful
articles
it
would
be
on
a
large
scale
equivalent
to
the
chest
found
at
flotsam
point
and
besides
thought
pencroft
why
should
it
be
impossible
to
refloat
the
brig
if
she
has
only
a
leak
that
may
be
stopped
up
a
vessel
from
three
to
four
hundred
tons
why
she
is
a
regular
ship
compared
to
our
bonadventure
and
we
could
go
a
long
distance
in
her
we
could
go
anywhere
we
liked
captain
harding
ayrton
and
i
must
examine
her
she
would
be
well
worth
the
trouble
in
fact
if
the
brig
was
still
fit
to
navigate
the
colonists
chances
of
returning
to
their
native
land
were
singularly
increased
but
to
decide
this
important
question
it
was
necessary
to
wait
until
the
tide
was
quite
low
so
that
every
part
of
the
brigs
hull
might
be
examined
when
their
treasures
had
been
safely
conveyed
on
shore
harding
and
his
companions
agreed
to
devote
some
minutes
to
breakfast
they
were
almost
famished
fortunately
the
larder
was
not
far
off
and
neb
was
noted
for
being
an
expeditious
cook
they
breakfasted
therefore
near
the
chimneys
and
during
their
repast
as
may
be
supposed
nothing
was
talked
of
but
the
event
which
had
so
miraculously
saved
the
colony
miraculous
is
the
word
repeated
pencroft
for
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
those
rascals
blew
up
just
at
the
right
moment
granite
house
was
beginning
to
be
uncomfortable
as
a
habitation
and
can
you
guess
pencroft
asked
the
reporter
how
it
happened
or
what
can
have
occasioned
the
explosion
oh
mr
spilett
nothing
is
more
simple
answered
pencroft
a
convict
vessel
is
not
disciplined
like
a
manofwar
convicts
are
not
sailors
of
course
the
powdermagazine
was
open
and
as
they
were
firing
incessantly
some
careless
or
clumsy
fellow
just
blew
up
the
vessel
captain
harding
said
herbert
what
astonishes
me
is
that
the
explosion
has
not
produced
more
effect
the
report
was
not
loud
and
besides
there
are
so
few
planks
and
timbers
torn
out
it
seems
as
if
the
ship
had
rather
foundered
than
blown
up
does
that
astonish
you
my
boy
asked
the
engineer
yes
captain
and
it
astonishes
me
also
herbert
replied
he
but
when
we
visit
the
hull
of
the
brig
we
shall
no
doubt
find
the
explanation
of
the
matter
why
captain
said
pencroft
you
dont
suppose
that
the
speedy
simply
foundered
like
a
ship
which
has
struck
on
a
rock
why
not
observed
neb
if
there
are
rocks
in
the
channel
nonsense
neb
answered
pencroft
you
did
not
look
at
the
right
moment
an
instant
before
she
sank
the
brig
as
i
saw
perfectly
well
rose
on
an
enormous
wave
and
fell
back
on
her
larboard
side
now
if
she
had
only
struck
she
would
have
sunk
quietly
and
gone
to
the
bottom
like
an
honest
vessel
it
was
just
because
she
was
not
an
honest
vessel
returned
neb
well
we
shall
soon
see
pencroft
said
the
engineer
we
shall
soon
see
rejoined
the
sailor
but
i
would
wager
my
head
there
are
no
rocks
in
the
channel
look
here
captain
to
speak
candidly
do
you
mean
to
say
that
there
is
anything
marvelous
in
the
occurrence
cyrus
harding
did
not
answer
at
any
rate
said
gideon
spilett
whether
rock
or
explosion
you
will
agree
pencroft
that
it
occurred
just
in
the
nick
of
time
yes
yes
replied
the
sailor
but
that
is
not
the
question
i
ask
captain
harding
if
he
sees
anything
supernatural
in
all
this
i
cannot
say
pencroft
said
the
engineer
that
is
all
the
answer
i
can
make
a
reply
which
did
not
satisfy
pencroft
at
all
he
stuck
to
an
explosion
and
did
not
wish
to
give
it
up
he
would
never
consent
to
admit
that
in
that
channel
with
its
fine
sandy
bed
just
like
the
beach
which
he
had
often
crossed
at
low
water
there
could
be
an
unknown
rock
and
besides
at
the
time
the
brig
foundered
it
was
high
water
that
is
to
say
there
was
enough
water
to
carry
the
vessel
clear
over
any
rocks
which
would
not
be
uncovered
at
low
tide
therefore
there
could
not
have
been
a
collision
therefore
the
vessel
had
not
struck
so
she
had
blown
up
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
sailors
arguments
were
reasonable
towards
halfpast
one
the
colonists
embarked
in
the
boat
to
visit
the
wreck
it
was
to
be
regretted
that
the
brigs
two
boats
had
not
been
saved
but
one
as
has
been
said
had
gone
to
pieces
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
and
was
absolutely
useless
the
other
had
disappeared
when
the
brig
went
down
and
had
not
again
been
seen
having
doubtless
been
crushed
the
hull
of
the
speedy
was
just
beginning
to
issue
from
the
water
the
brig
was
lying
right
over
on
her
side
for
her
masts
being
broken
pressed
down
by
the
weight
of
the
ballast
displaced
by
the
shock
the
keel
was
visible
along
her
whole
length
she
had
been
regularly
turned
over
by
the
inexplicable
but
frightful
submarine
action
which
had
been
at
the
same
time
manifested
by
an
enormous
waterspout
the
settlers
rowed
round
the
hull
and
in
proportion
as
the
tide
went
down
they
could
ascertain
if
not
the
cause
which
had
occasioned
the
catastrophe
at
least
the
effect
produced
towards
the
bows
on
both
sides
of
the
keel
seven
or
eight
feet
from
the
beginning
of
the
stem
the
sides
of
the
brig
were
frightfully
torn
over
a
length
of
at
least
twenty
feet
there
opened
two
large
leaks
which
would
be
impossible
to
stop
up
not
only
had
the
copper
sheathing
and
the
planks
disappeared
reduced
no
doubt
to
powder
but
also
the
ribs
the
iron
bolts
and
treenails
which
united
them
from
the
entire
length
of
the
hull
to
the
stern
the
false
keel
had
been
separated
with
an
unaccountable
violence
and
the
keel
itself
torn
from
the
carline
in
several
places
was
split
in
all
its
length
ive
a
notion
exclaimed
pencroft
that
this
vessel
will
be
difficult
to
get
afloat
again
it
will
be
impossible
said
ayrton
at
any
rate
observed
gideon
spilett
to
the
sailor
the
explosion
if
there
has
been
one
has
produced
singular
effects
it
has
split
the
lower
part
of
the
hull
instead
of
blowing
up
the
deck
and
topsides
these
great
rents
appear
rather
to
have
been
made
by
a
rock
than
by
the
explosion
of
a
powdermagazine
there
is
not
a
rock
in
the
channel
answered
the
sailor
i
will
admit
anything
you
like
except
the
rock
let
us
try
to
penetrate
into
the
interior
of
the
brig
said
the
engineer
perhaps
we
shall
then
know
what
to
think
of
the
cause
of
her
destruction
this
was
the
best
thing
to
be
done
and
it
was
agreed
besides
to
take
an
inventory
of
all
the
treasures
on
board
and
to
arrange
their
preservation
access
to
the
interior
of
the
brig
was
now
easy
the
tide
was
still
going
down
and
the
deck
was
practicable
the
ballast
composed
of
heavy
masses
of
iron
had
broken
through
in
several
places
the
noise
of
the
sea
could
be
heard
as
it
rushed
out
at
the
holes
in
the
hull
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
hatchets
in
hand
advanced
along
the
shattered
deck
cases
of
all
sorts
encumbered
it
and
as
they
had
been
but
a
very
short
time
in
the
water
their
contents
were
perhaps
uninjured
they
then
busied
themselves
in
placing
all
this
cargo
in
safety
the
water
would
not
return
for
several
hours
and
these
hours
must
be
employed
in
the
most
profitable
way
ayrton
and
pencroft
had
at
the
entrance
made
in
the
hull
discovered
tackle
which
would
serve
to
hoist
up
the
barrels
and
chests
the
boat
received
them
and
transported
them
to
the
shore
they
took
the
articles
as
they
came
intending
to
sort
them
afterwards
at
any
rate
the
settlers
saw
at
once
with
extreme
satisfaction
that
the
brig
possessed
a
very
varied
cargoan
assortment
of
all
sorts
of
articles
utensils
manufactured
goods
and
toolssuch
as
the
ships
which
make
the
great
coastingtrade
of
polynesia
are
usually
laden
with
it
was
probable
that
they
would
find
a
little
of
everything
and
they
agreed
that
it
was
exactly
what
was
necessary
for
the
colony
of
lincoln
island
howeverand
cyrus
harding
observed
it
in
silent
astonishmentnot
only
as
has
been
said
had
the
hull
of
the
brig
enormously
suffered
from
the
shock
whatever
it
was
that
had
occasioned
the
catastrophe
but
the
interior
arrangements
had
been
destroyed
especially
towards
the
bows
partitions
and
stanchions
were
smashed
as
if
some
tremendous
shell
had
burst
in
the
interior
of
the
brig
the
colonists
could
easily
go
fore
and
aft
after
having
removed
the
cases
as
they
were
extricated
they
were
not
heavy
bales
which
would
have
been
difficult
to
remove
but
simple
packages
of
which
the
stowage
besides
was
no
longer
recognizable
the
colonists
then
reached
the
stern
of
the
brigthe
part
formerly
surmounted
by
the
poop
it
was
there
that
following
ayrtons
directions
they
must
look
for
the
powdermagazine
cyrus
harding
thought
that
it
had
not
exploded
that
it
was
possible
some
barrels
might
be
saved
and
that
the
powder
which
is
usually
enclosed
in
metal
coverings
might
not
have
suffered
from
contact
with
the
water
this
in
fact
was
just
what
had
happened
they
extricated
from
among
a
large
number
of
shot
twenty
barrels
the
insides
of
which
were
lined
with
copper
pencroft
was
convinced
by
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
that
the
destruction
of
the
speedy
could
not
be
attributed
to
an
explosion
that
part
of
the
hull
in
which
the
magazine
was
situated
was
moreover
that
which
had
suffered
least
it
may
be
so
said
the
obstinate
sailor
but
as
to
a
rock
there
is
not
one
in
the
channel
then
how
did
it
happen
asked
herbert
i
dont
know
answered
pencroft
captain
harding
doesnt
know
and
nobody
knows
or
ever
will
know
several
hours
had
passed
during
these
researches
and
the
tide
began
to
flow
work
must
be
suspended
for
the
present
there
was
no
fear
of
the
brig
being
carried
away
by
the
sea
for
she
was
already
fixed
as
firmly
as
if
moored
by
her
anchors
they
could
therefore
without
inconvenience
wait
until
the
next
day
to
resume
operations
but
as
to
the
vessel
itself
she
was
doomed
and
it
would
be
best
to
hasten
to
save
the
remains
of
her
hull
as
she
would
not
be
long
in
disappearing
in
the
quicksands
of
the
channel
it
was
now
five
oclock
in
the
evening
it
had
been
a
hard
days
work
for
the
men
they
ate
with
good
appetite
and
notwithstanding
their
fatigue
they
could
not
resist
after
dinner
their
desire
of
inspecting
the
cases
which
composed
the
cargo
of
the
speedy
most
of
them
contained
clothes
which
as
may
be
believed
was
well
received
there
were
enough
to
clothe
a
whole
colonylinen
for
every
ones
use
shoes
for
every
ones
feet
we
are
too
rich
exclaimed
pencroft
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
all
this
and
every
moment
burst
forth
the
hurrahs
of
the
delighted
sailor
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
barrels
of
gunpowder
firearms
and
sidearms
balls
of
cotton
implements
of
husbandry
carpenters
joiners
and
blacksmiths
tools
and
boxes
of
all
kinds
of
seeds
not
in
the
least
injured
by
their
short
sojourn
in
the
water
ah
two
years
before
how
these
things
would
have
been
prized
and
now
even
though
the
industrious
colonists
had
provided
themselves
with
tools
these
treasures
would
find
their
use
there
was
no
want
of
space
in
the
storerooms
of
granite
house
but
that
daytime
would
not
allow
them
to
stow
away
the
whole
it
would
not
do
also
to
forget
that
the
six
survivors
of
the
speedys
crew
had
landed
on
the
island
for
they
were
in
all
probability
scoundrels
of
the
deepest
dye
and
it
was
necessary
that
the
colonists
should
be
on
their
guard
against
them
although
the
bridges
over
the
mercy
were
raised
the
convicts
would
not
be
stopped
by
a
river
or
a
stream
and
rendered
desperate
these
wretches
would
be
capable
of
anything
they
would
see
later
what
plan
it
would
be
best
to
follow
but
in
the
meantime
it
was
necessary
to
mount
guard
over
cases
and
packages
heaped
up
near
the
chimneys
and
thus
the
settlers
employed
themselves
in
turn
during
the
night
the
morning
came
however
without
the
convicts
having
attempted
any
attack
master
jup

at
the

and
21st
of

of

whatever
either
from

of

at
low

they
overhauled
the

high
tide
they
stowed
away
the
rescued
articles
a
great
part
of
the
copper
sheathing
had
been
torn
from
the
hull
which
every
day
sank
lower
but
before
the
sand
had
swallowed
the
heavy
things
which
had
fallen
through
the
bottom
ayrton
and
pencroft
diving
to
the
bed
of
the
channel
recovered
the
chains
and
anchors
of
the
brig
the
iron
of
her
ballast
and
even
four
guns
which
floated
by
means
of
empty
casks
were
brought
to
shore
it
may
be
seen
that
the
arsenal
of
the
colony
had
gained
by
the
wreck
as
well
as
the
storerooms
of
granite
house
pencroft
always
enthusiastic
in
his
projects
already
spoke
of
constructing
a
battery
to
command
the
channel
and
the
mouth
of
the
river
with
four
guns
he
engaged
to
prevent
any
fleet
however
powerful
it
might
be
from
venturing
into
the
waters
of
lincoln
island
in
the
meantime
when
nothing
remained
of
the
brig
but
a
useless
hulk
bad
weather
came
on
which
soon
finished
her
cyrus
harding
had
intended
to
blow
her
up
so
as
to
collect
the
remains
on
the
shore
but
a
strong
gale
from
the
northeast
and
a
heavy
sea
compelled
him
to
economize
his
powder
in
fact
on
the
night
of
the
23rd
the
hull
entirely
broke
up
and
some
of
the
wreck
was
cast
up
on
the
beach
as
to
the
papers
on
board
it
is
useless
to
say
that
although
he
carefully
searched
the
lockers
of
the
poop
harding
did
not
discover
any
trace
of
them
the
pirates
had
evidently
destroyed
everything
that
concerned
either
the
captain
or
the
owners
of
the
speedy
and
as
the
name
of
her
port
was
not
painted
on
her
counter
there
was
nothing
which
would
tell
them
her
nationality
however
by
the
shape
of
her
boats
ayrton
and
pencroft
believed
that
the
brig
was
of
english
build
a
week
after
the
castropheor
rather
after
the
fortunate
though
inexplicable
event
to
which
the
colony
owed
its
preservationnothing
more
could
be
seen
of
the
vessel
even
at
low
tide
the
wreck
had
disappeared
and
granite
house
was
enriched
by
nearly
all
it
had
contained
however
the
mystery
which
enveloped
its
strange
destruction
would
doubtless
never
have
been
cleared
away
if
on
the
30th
of
november
neb
strolling
on
the
beach
had
not
found
a
piece
of
a
thick
iron
cylinder
bearing
traces
of
explosion
the
edges
of
this
cylinder
were
twisted
and
broken
as
if
they
had
been
subjected
to
the
action
of
some
explosive
substance
neb
brought
this
piece
of
metal
to
his
master
who
was
then
occupied
with
his
companions
in
the
workshop
of
the
chimneys
cyrus
harding
examined
the
cylinder
attentively
then
turning
to
pencroft
you
persist
my
friend
said
he
in
maintaining
that
the
speedy
was
not
lost
in
consequence
of
a
collision
yes
captain
answered
the
sailor
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
there
are
no
rocks
in
the
channel
but
suppose
she
had
run
against
this
piece
of
iron
said
the
engineer
showing
the
broken
cylinder
what
that
bit
of
pipe
exclaimed
pencroft
in
a
tone
of
perfect
incredulity
my
friends
resumed
harding
you
remember
that
before
she
foundered
the
brig
rose
on
the
summit
of
a
regular
waterspout
yes
captain
replied
herbert
well
would
you
like
to
know
what
occasioned
that
waterspout
it
was
this
said
the
engineer
holding
up
the
broken
tube
that
returned
pencroft
yes
this
cylinder
is
all
that
remains
of
a
torpedo
a
torpedo
exclaimed
the
engineers
companions
and
who
put
the
torpedo
there
demanded
pencroft
who
did
not
like
to
yield
all
that
i
can
tell
you
is
that
it
was
not
i
answered
cyrus
harding
but
it
was
there
and
you
have
been
able
to
judge
of
its
incomparable
power
chapter
5
so
then
all
was
explained
by
the
submarine
explosion
of
this
torpedo
cyrus
harding
could
not
be
mistaken
as
during
the
war
of
the
union
he
had
had
occasion
to
try
these
terrible
engines
of
destruction
it
was
under
the
action
of
this
cylinder
charged
with
some
explosive
substance
nitroglycerine
picrate
or
some
other
material
of
the
same
nature
that
the
water
of
the
channel
had
been
raised
like
a
dome
the
bottom
of
the
brig
crushed
in
and
she
had
sunk
instantly
the
damage
done
to
her
hull
being
so
considerable
that
it
was
impossible
to
refloat
her
the
speedy
had
not
been
able
to
withstand
a
torpedo
that
would
have
destroyed
an
ironclad
as
easily
as
a
fishingboat
yes
all
was
explained
everythingexcept
the
presence
of
the
torpedo
in
the
waters
of
the
channel
my
friends
then
said
cyrus
harding
we
can
no
longer
be
in
doubt
as
to
the
presence
of
a
mysterious
being
a
castaway
like
us
perhaps
abandoned
on
our
island
and
i
say
this
in
order
that
ayrton
may
be
acquainted
with
all
the
strange
events
which
have
occurred
during
these
two
years
who
this
beneficent
stranger
is
whose
intervention
has
so
fortunately
for
us
been
manifested
on
many
occasions
i
cannot
imagine
what
his
object
can
be
in
acting
thus
in
concealing
himself
after
rendering
us
so
many
services
i
cannot
understand
but
his
services
are
not
the
less
real
and
are
of
such
a
nature
that
only
a
man
possessed
of
prodigious
power
could
render
them
ayrton
is
indebted
to
him
as
much
as
we
are
for
if
it
was
the
stranger
who
saved
me
from
the
waves
after
the
fall
from
the
balloon
evidently
it
was
he
who
wrote
the
document
who
placed
the
bottle
in
the
channel
and
who
has
made
known
to
us
the
situation
of
our
companion
i
will
add
that
it
was
he
who
guided
that
chest
provided
with
everything
we
wanted
and
stranded
it
on
flotsam
point
that
it
was
he
who
lighted
that
fire
on
the
heights
of
the
island
which
permitted
you
to
land
that
it
was
he
who
fired
that
bullet
found
in
the
body
of
the
peccary
that
it
was
he
who
plunged
that
torpedo
into
the
channel
which
destroyed
the
brig
in
a
word
that
all
those
inexplicable
events
for
which
we
could
not
assign
a
reason
are
due
to
this
mysterious
being
therefore
whoever
he
may
be
whether
shipwrecked
or
exiled
on
our
island
we
shall
be
ungrateful
if
we
think
ourselves
freed
from
gratitude
towards
him
we
have
contracted
a
debt
and
i
hope
that
we
shall
one
day
pay
it
you
are
right
in
speaking
thus
my
dear
cyrus
replied
gideon
spilett
yes
there
is
an
almost
allpowerful
being
hidden
in
some
part
of
the
island
and
whose
influence
has
been
singularly
useful
to
our
colony
i
will
add
that
the
unknown
appears
to
possess
means
of
action
which
border
on
the
supernatural
if
in
the
events
of
practical
life
the
supernatural
were
recognizable
is
it
he
who
is
in
secret
communication
with
us
by
the
well
in
granite
house
and
has
he
thus
a
knowledge
of
all
our
plans
was
it
he
who
threw
us
that
bottle
when
the
vessel
made
her
first
cruise
was
it
he
who
threw
top
out
of
the
lake
and
killed
the
dugong
was
it
he
who
as
everything
leads
us
to
believe
saved
you
from
the
waves
and
that
under
circumstances
in
which
any
one
else
would
not
have
been
able
to
act
if
it
was
he
he
possesses
a
power
which
renders
him
master
of
the
elements
the
reporters
reasoning
was
just
and
every
one
felt
it
to
be
so
yes
rejoined
cyrus
harding
if
the
intervention
of
a
human
being
is
not
more
questionable
for
us
i
agree
that
he
has
at
his
disposal
means
of
action
beyond
those
possessed
by
humanity
there
is
a
mystery
still
but
if
we
discover
the
man
the
mystery
will
be
discovered
also
the
question
then
is
ought
we
to
respect
the
incognito
of
this
generous
being
or
ought
we
to
do
everything
to
find
him
out
what
is
your
opinion
on
the
matter
my
opinion
said
pencroft
is
that
whoever
he
may
be
he
is
a
brave
man
and
he
has
my
esteem
be
it
so
answered
harding
but
that
is
not
an
answer
pencroft
master
then
said
neb
my
idea
is
that
we
may
search
as
long
as
we
like
for
this
gentleman
whom
you
are
talking
about
but
that
we
shall
not
discover
him
till
he
pleases
thats
not
bad
what
you
say
neb
observed
pencroft
i
am
of
nebs
opinion
said
gideon
spilett
but
that
is
no
reason
for
not
attempting
the
adventure
whether
we
find
this
mysterious
being
or
not
we
shall
at
least
have
fulfilled
our
duty
towards
him
and
you
my
boy
give
us
your
opinion
said
the
engineer
turning
to
herbert
oh
cried
herbert
his
countenance
full
of
animation
how
i
should
like
to
thank
him
he
who
saved
you
first
and
who
has
now
saved
us
of
course
my
boy
replied
pencroft
so
would
i
and
all
of
us
i
am
not
inquisitive
but
i
would
give
one
of
my
eyes
to
see
this
individual
face
to
face
it
seems
to
me
that
he
must
be
handsome
tall
strong
with
a
splendid
beard
radiant
hair
and
that
he
must
be
seated
on
clouds
a
great
ball
in
his
hands
but
pencroft
answered
spilett
you
are
describing
a
picture
of
the
creator
possibly
mr
spilett
replied
the
sailor
but
that
is
how
i
imagine
him
and
you
ayrton
asked
the
engineer
captain
harding
replied
ayrton
i
can
give
you
no
better
advice
in
this
matter
whatever
you
do
will
be
best
when
you
wish
me
to
join
you
in
your
researches
i
am
ready
to
follow
you
i
thank
you
ayrton
answered
cyrus
harding
but
i
should
like
a
more
direct
answer
to
the
question
i
put
to
you
you
are
our
companion
you
have
already
endangered
your
life
several
times
for
us
and
you
as
well
as
the
rest
ought
to
be
consulted
in
the
matter
of
any
important
decision
speak
therefore
captain
harding
replied
ayrton
i
think
that
we
ought
to
do
everything
to
discover
this
unknown
benefactor
perhaps
he
is
alone
perhaps
he
is
suffering
perhaps
he
has
a
life
to
be
renewed
i
too
as
you
said
have
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
pay
him
it
was
he
it
could
be
only
he
who
must
have
come
to
tabor
island
who
found
there
the
wretch
you
knew
and
who
made
known
to
you
that
there
was
an
unfortunate
man
there
to
be
saved
therefore
it
is
thanks
to
him
that
i
have
become
a
man
again
no
i
will
never
forget
him
that
is
settled
then
said
cyrus
harding
we
will
begin
our
researches
as
soon
as
possible
we
will
not
leave
a
corner
of
the
island
unexplored
we
will
search
into
its
most
secret
recesses
and
will
hope
that
our
unknown
friend
will
pardon
us
in
consideration
of
our
intentions
for
several
days
the
colonists
were
actively
employed
in
haymaking
and
the
harvest
before
putting
their
project
of
exploring
the
yet
unknown
parts
of
the
island
into
execution
they
wished
to
get
all
possible
work
finished
it
was
also
the
time
for
collecting
the
various
vegetables
from
the
tabor
island
plants
all
was
stowed
away
and
happily
there
was
no
want
of
room
in
granite
house
in
which
they
might
have
housed
all
the
treasures
of
the
island
the
products
of
the
colony
were
there
methodically
arranged
and
in
a
safe
place
as
may
be
believed
sheltered
as
much
from
animals
as
from
man
there
was
no
fear
of
damp
in
the
middle
of
that
thick
mass
of
granite
many
natural
excavations
situated
in
the
upper
passage
were
enlarged
either
by
pickaxe
or
mine
and
granite
house
thus
became
a
general
warehouse
containing
all
the
provisions
arms
tools
and
spare
utensilsin
a
word
all
the
stores
of
the
colony
as
to
the
guns
obtained
from
the
brig
they
were
pretty
pieces
of
ordnance
which
at
pencrofts
entreaty
were
hoisted
by
means
of
tackle
and
pulleys
right
up
into
granite
house
embrasures
were
made
between
the
windows
and
the
shining
muzzles
of
the
guns
could
soon
be
seen
through
the
granite
cliff
from
this
height
they
commanded
all
union
bay
it
was
like
a
little
gibraltar
and
any
vessel
anchored
off
the
islet
would
inevitably
be
exposed
to
the
fire
of
this
aerial
battery
captain
said
pencroft
one
day
it
was
the
8th
of
november
now
that
our
fortifications
are
finished
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
we
tried
the
range
of
our
guns
do
you
think
that
is
useful
asked
the
engineer
it
is
more
than
useful
it
is
necessary
without
that
how
are
we
to
know
to
what
distance
we
can
send
one
of
those
pretty
shot
with
which
we
are
provided
try
them
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
however
i
think
that
in
making
the
experiment
we
ought
to
employ
not
the
ordinary
powder
the
supply
of
which
i
think
should
remain
untouched
but
the
pyroxyle
which
will
never
fail
us
can
the
cannon
support
the
shock
of
the
pyroxyle
asked
the
reporter
who
was
not
less
anxious
than
pencroft
to
try
the
artillery
of
granite
house
i
believe
so
however
added
the
engineer
we
will
be
prudent
the
engineer
was
right
in
thinking
that
the
guns
were
of
excellent
make
made
of
forged
steel
and
breechloaders
they
ought
consequently
to
be
able
to
bear
a
considerable
charge
and
also
have
an
enormous
range
in
fact
as
regards
practical
effect
the
transit
described
by
the
ball
ought
to
be
as
extended
as
possible
and
this
tension
could
only
be
obtained
under
the
condition
that
the
projectile
should
be
impelled
with
a
very
great
initial
velocity
now
said
harding
to
his
companions
the
initial
velocity
is
in
proportion
to
the
quantity
of
powder
used
in
the
fabrication
of
these
pieces
everything
depends
on
employing
a
metal
with
the
highest
possible
power
of
resistance
and
steel
is
incontestably
that
metal
of
all
others
which
resists
the
best
i
have
therefore
reason
to
believe
that
our
guns
will
bear
without
risk
the
expansion
of
the
pyroxyle
gas
and
will
give
excellent
results
we
shall
be
a
great
deal
more
certain
of
that
when
we
have
tried
them
answered
pencroft
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
the
four
cannons
were
in
perfect
order
since
they
had
been
taken
from
the
water
the
sailor
had
bestowed
great
care
upon
them
how
many
hours
he
had
spent
in
rubbing
greasing
and
polishing
them
and
in
cleaning
the
mechanism
and
now
the
pieces
were
as
brilliant
as
if
they
had
been
on
board
a
frigate
of
the
united
states
navy
on
this
day
therefore
in
presence
of
all
the
members
of
the
colony
including
master
jup
and
top
the
four
cannon
were
successively
tried
they
were
charged
with
pyroxyle
taking
into
consideration
its
explosive
power
which
as
has
been
said
is
four
times
that
of
ordinary
powder
the
projectile
to
be
fired
was
cylindroconic
pencroft
holding
the
end
of
the
quickmatch
stood
ready
to
fire
at
hardings
signal
he
fired
the
shot
passing
over
the
islet
fell
into
the
sea
at
a
distance
which
could
not
be
calculated
with
exactitude
the
second
gun
was
pointed
at
the
rocks
at
the
end
of
flotsam
point
and
the
shot
striking
a
sharp
rock
nearly
three
miles
from
granite
house
made
it
fly
into
splinters
it
was
herbert
who
had
pointed
this
gun
and
fired
it
and
very
proud
he
was
of
his
first
shot
pencroft
only
was
prouder
than
he
such
a
shot
the
honor
of
which
belonged
to
his
dear
boy
the
third
shot
aimed
this
time
at
the
downs
forming
the
upper
side
of
union
bay
struck
the
sand
at
a
distance
of
four
miles
then
having
ricocheted
was
lost
in
the
sea
in
a
cloud
of
spray
for
the
fourth
piece
cyrus
harding
slightly
increased
the
charge
so
as
to
try
its
extreme
range
then
all
standing
aside
for
fear
of
its
bursting
the
match
was
lighted
by
means
of
a
long
cord
a
tremendous
report
was
heard
but
the
piece
had
held
good
and
the
colonists
rushing
to
the
windows
saw
the
shot
graze
the
rocks
of
mandible
cape
nearly
five
miles
from
granite
house
and
disappear
in
shark
gulf
well
captain
exclaimed
pencroft
whose
cheers
might
have
rivaled
the
reports
themselves
what
do
you
say
of
our
battery
all
the
pirates
in
the
pacific
have
only
to
present
themselves
before
granite
house
not
one
can
land
there
now
without
our
permission
believe
me
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
it
would
be
better
not
to
have
to
make
the
experiment
well
said
the
sailor
what
ought
to
be
done
with
regard
to
those
six
villains
who
are
roaming
about
the
island
are
we
to
leave
them
to
overrun
our
forests
our
fields
our
plantations
these
pirates
are
regular
jaguars
and
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
not
to
hesitate
to
treat
them
as
such
what
do
you
think
ayrton
added
pencroft
turning
to
his
companion
ayrton
hesitated
at
first
to
reply
and
cyrus
harding
regretted
that
pencroft
had
so
thoughtlessly
put
this
question
and
he
was
much
moved
when
ayrton
replied
in
a
humble
tone
i
have
been
one
of
those
jaguars
mr
pencroft
i
have
no
right
to
speak
and
with
a
slow
step
he
walked
away
pencroft
understood
what
a
brute
i
am
he
exclaimed
poor
ayrton
he
has
as
much
right
to
speak
here
as
any
one
yes
said
gideon
spilett
but
his
reserve
does
him
honor
and
it
is
right
to
respect
the
feeling
which
he
has
about
his
sad
past
certainly
mr
spilett
answered
the
sailor
and
there
is
no
fear
of
my
doing
so
again
i
would
rather
bite
my
tongue
off
than
cause
ayrton
any
pain
but
to
return
to
the
question
it
seems
to
me
that
these
ruffians
have
no
right
to
any
pity
and
that
we
ought
to
rid
the
island
of
them
as
soon
as
possible
is
that
your
opinion
pencroft
asked
the
engineer
quite
my
opinion
and
before
hunting
them
mercilessly
you
would
not
wait
until
they
had
committed
some
fresh
act
of
hostility
against
us
isnt
what
they
have
done
already
enough
asked
pencroft
who
did
not
understand
these
scruples
they
may
adopt
other
sentiments
said
harding
and
perhaps
repent
they
repent
exclaimed
the
sailor
shrugging
his
shoulders
pencroft
think
of
ayrton
said
herbert
taking
the
sailors
hand
he
became
an
honest
man
again
pencroft
looked
at
his
companions
one
after
the
other
he
had
never
thought
of
his
proposal
being
met
with
any
objection
his
rough
nature
could
not
allow
that
they
ought
to
come
to
terms
with
the
rascals
who
had
landed
on
the
island
with
bob
harveys
accomplices
the
murderers
of
the
crew
of
the
speedy
and
he
looked
upon
them
as
wild
beasts
which
ought
to
be
destroyed
without
delay
and
without
remorse
come
said
be
everybody
is
against
me
you
wish
to
be
generous
to
those
villains
very
well
i
hope
we
maynt
repent
it
what
danger
shall
we
run
said
herbert
if
we
take
care
to
be
always
on
our
guard
hum
observed
the
reporter
who
had
not
given
any
decided
opinion
they
are
six
and
well
armed
if
they
each
lay
hid
in
a
corner
and
each
fired
at
one
of
us
they
would
soon
be
masters
of
the
colony
why
have
they
not
done
so
said
herbert
no
doubt
because
it
was
not
their
interest
to
do
it
besides
we
are
six
also
well
well
replied
pencroft
whom
no
reasoning
could
have
convinced
let
us
leave
these
good
people
to
do
what
they
like
and
dont
think
anything
more
about
them
come
pencroft
said
neb
dont
make
yourself
out
so
bad
as
all
that
suppose
one
of
these
unfortunate
men
were
here
before
you
within
good
range
of
your
guns
you
would
not
fire
i
would
fire
on
him
as
i
would
on
a
mad
dog
neb
replied
pencroft
coldly
pencroft
said
the
engineer
you
have
always
shown
much
deference
to
my
advice
will
you
in
this
matter
yield
to
me
i
will
do
as
you
please
captain
harding
answered
the
sailor
who
was
not
at
all
convinced
very
well
wait
and
we
will
not
attack
them
unless
we
are
attacked
first
thus
their
behavior
towards
the
pirates
was
agreed
upon
although
pencroft
augured
nothing
good
from
it
they
were
not
to
attack
them
but
were
to
be
on
their
guard
after
all
the
island
was
large
and
fertile
if
any
sentiment
of
honesty
yet
remained
in
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
these
wretches
might
perhaps
be
reclaimed
was
it
not
their
interest
in
the
situation
in
which
they
found
themselves
to
begin
a
new
life
at
any
rate
for
humanitys
sake
alone
it
would
be
right
to
wait
the
colonists
would
no
longer
as
before
be
able
to
go
and
come
without
fear
hitherto
they
had
only
wild
beasts
to
guard
against
and
now
six
convicts
of
the
worst
description
perhaps
were
roaming
over
their
island
it
was
serious
certainly
and
to
less
brave
men
it
would
have
been
security
lost
no
matter
at
present
the
colonists
had
reason
on
their
side
against
pencroft
would
they
be
right
in
the
future
that
remained
to
be
seen
chapter
6
however
the
chief
business
of
the
colonists
was
to
make
that
complete
exploration
of
the
island
which
had
been
decided
upon
and
which
would
have
two
objects
to
discover
the
mysterious
being
whose
existence
was
now
indisputable
and
at
the
same
time
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
the
pirates
what
retreat
they
had
chosen
what
sort
of
life
they
were
leading
and
what
was
to
be
feared
from
them
cyrus
harding
wished
to
set
out
without
delay
but
as
the
expedition
would
be
of
some
days
duration
it
appeared
best
to
load
the
cart
with
different
materials
and
tools
in
order
to
facilitate
the
organization
of
the
encampments
one
of
the
onagers
however
having
hurt
its
leg
could
not
be
harnessed
at
present
and
a
few
days
rest
was
necessary
the
departure
was
therefore
put
off
for
a
week
until
the
20th
of
november
the
month
of
november
in
this
latitude
corresponds
to
the
month
of
may
in
the
northern
zones
it
was
therefore
the
fine
season
the
sun
was
entering
the
tropic
of
capricorn
and
gave
the
longest
days
in
the
year
the
time
was
therefore
very
favorable
for
the
projected
expedition
which
if
it
did
not
accomplish
its
principal
object
would
at
any
rate
be
fruitful
in
discoveries
especially
of
natural
productions
since
harding
proposed
to
explore
those
dense
forests
of
the
far
west
which
stretched
to
the
extremity
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
during
the
nine
days
which
preceded
their
departure
it
was
agreed
that
the
work
on
prospect
heights
should
be
finished
off
moreover
it
was
necessary
for
ayrton
to
return
to
the
corral
where
the
domesticated
animals
required
his
care
it
was
decided
that
he
should
spend
two
days
there
and
return
to
granite
house
after
having
liberally
supplied
the
stables
as
he
was
about
to
start
harding
asked
him
if
he
would
not
like
one
of
them
to
accompany
him
observing
that
the
island
was
less
safe
than
formerly
ayrton
replied
that
this
was
unnecessary
as
he
was
enough
for
the
work
and
that
besides
he
apprehended
no
danger
if
anything
occurred
at
the
corral
or
in
the
neighborhood
he
could
instantly
warn
the
colonists
by
sending
a
telegram
to
granite
house
ayrton
departed
at
dawn
on
the
9th
taking
the
cart
drawn
by
one
onager
and
two
hours
after
the
electric
wire
announced
that
he
had
found
all
in
order
at
the
corral
during
these
two
days
harding
busied
himself
in
executing
a
project
which
would
completely
guard
granite
house
against
any
surprise
it
was
necessary
to
completely
conceal
the
opening
of
the
old
outlet
which
was
already
walled
up
and
partly
hidden
under
grass
and
plants
at
the
southern
angle
of
lake
grant
nothing
was
easier
since
if
the
level
of
the
lake
was
raised
two
or
three
feet
the
opening
would
be
quite
beneath
it
now
to
raise
this
level
they
had
only
to
establish
a
dam
at
the
two
openings
made
by
the
lake
and
by
which
were
fed
creek
glycerine
and
falls
river
the
colonists
worked
with
a
will
and
the
two
dams
which
besides
did
not
exceed
eight
feet
in
width
by
three
in
height
were
rapidly
erected
by
means
of
wellcemented
blocks
of
stone
this
work
finished
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
guess
that
at
that
part
of
the
lake
there
existed
a
subterranean
passage
through
which
the
overflow
of
the
lake
formerly
escaped
of
course
the
little
stream
which
fed
the
reservoir
of
granite
house
and
worked
the
lift
had
been
carefully
preserved
and
the
water
could
not
fail
the
lift
once
raised
this
sure
and
comfortable
retreat
would
be
safe
from
any
surprise
this
work
had
been
so
quickly
done
that
pencroft
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
found
time
to
make
an
expedition
to
port
balloon
the
sailor
was
very
anxious
to
know
if
the
little
creek
in
which
the
bonadventure
was
moored
had
been
visited
by
the
convicts
these
gentlemen
he
observed
landed
on
the
south
coast
and
if
they
followed
the
shore
it
is
to
be
feared
that
they
may
have
discovered
the
little
harbor
and
in
that
case
i
wouldnt
give
halfadollar
for
our
bonadventure
pencrofts
apprehensions
were
not
without
foundation
and
a
visit
to
port
balloon
appeared
to
be
very
desirable
the
sailor
and
his
companions
set
off
on
the
10th
of
november
after
dinner
well
armed
pencroft
ostentatiously
slipping
two
bullets
into
each
barrel
of
his
rifle
shook
his
head
in
a
way
which
betokened
nothing
good
to
any
one
who
approached
too
near
him
whether
man
or
beast
as
he
said
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
also
took
their
guns
and
about
three
oclock
all
three
left
granite
house
neb
accompanied
them
to
the
turn
of
the
mercy
and
after
they
had
crossed
he
raised
the
bridge
it
was
agreed
that
a
gunshot
should
announce
the
colonists
return
and
that
at
the
signal
neb
should
return
and
reestablish
the
communication
between
the
two
banks
of
the
river
the
little
band
advanced
directly
along
the
road
which
led
to
the
southern
coast
of
the
island
this
was
only
a
distance
of
three
miles
and
a
half
but
gideon
spilett
and
his
companions
took
two
hours
to
traverse
it
they
examined
all
the
border
of
the
road
the
thick
forest
as
well
as
tabor
marsh
they
found
no
trace
of
the
fugitives
who
no
doubt
not
having
yet
discovered
the
number
of
the
colonists
or
the
means
of
defense
which
they
had
at
their
disposal
had
gained
the
less
accessible
parts
of
the
island
arrived
at
port
balloon
pencroft
saw
with
extreme
satisfaction
that
the
bonadventure
was
tranquilly
floating
in
the
narrow
creek
however
port
balloon
was
so
well
hidden
among
high
rocks
that
it
could
scarcely
be
discovered
either
from
the
land
or
the
sea
come
said
pencroft
the
blackguards
have
not
been
there
yet
long
grass
suits
reptiles
best
and
evidently
we
shall
find
them
in
the
far
west
and
its
very
lucky
for
if
they
had
found
the
bonadventure
added
herbert
they
would
have
gone
off
in
her
and
we
should
have
been
prevented
from
returning
to
tabor
island
indeed
remarked
the
reporter
it
will
be
important
to
take
a
document
there
which
will
make
known
the
situation
of
lincoln
island
and
ayrtons
new
residence
in
case
the
scotch
yacht
returns
to
fetch
him
well
the
bonadventure
is
always
there
mr
spilett
answered
the
sailor
she
and
her
crew
are
ready
to
start
at
a
moments
notice
i
think
pencroft
that
that
is
a
thing
to
be
done
after
our
exploration
of
the
island
is
finished
it
is
possible
after
all
that
the
stranger
if
we
manage
to
find
him
may
know
as
much
about
tabor
island
as
about
lincoln
island
do
not
forget
that
he
is
certainly
the
author
of
the
document
and
he
may
perhaps
know
how
far
we
may
count
on
the
return
of
the
yacht
but
exclaimed
pencroft
who
in
the
world
can
he
be
the
fellow
knows
us
and
we
know
nothing
about
him
if
he
is
a
simple
castaway
why
should
he
conceal
himself
we
are
honest
men
i
suppose
and
the
society
of
honest
men
isnt
unpleasant
to
any
one
did
he
come
here
voluntarily
can
he
leave
the
island
if
he
likes
is
he
here
still
will
he
remain
any
longer
chatting
thus
pencroft
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
got
on
board
and
looked
about
the
deck
of
the
bonadventure
all
at
once
the
sailor
having
examined
the
bitts
to
which
the
cable
of
the
anchor
was
secured
hallo
he
cried
this
is
queer
what
is
the
matter
pencroft
asked
the
reporter
the
matter
is
that
it
was
not
i
who
made
this
knot
and
pencroft
showed
a
rope
which
fastened
the
cable
to
the
bitt
itself
what
it
was
not
you
asked
gideon
spilett
no
i
can
swear
to
it
this
is
a
reef
knot
and
i
always
make
a
running
bowline
you
must
be
mistaken
pencroft
i
am
not
mistaken
declared
the
sailor
my
hand
does
it
so
naturally
and
ones
hand
is
never
mistaken
then
can
the
convicts
have
been
on
board
asked
herbert
i
know
nothing
about
that
answered
pencroft
but
what
is
certain
is
that
some
one
has
weighed
the
bonadventures
anchor
and
dropped
it
again
and
look
here
here
is
another
proof
the
cable
of
the
anchor
has
been
run
out
and
its
service
is
no
longer
at
the
hawsehole
i
repeat
that
some
one
has
been
using
our
vessel
but
if
the
convicts
had
used
her
they
would
have
pillaged
her
or
rather
gone
off
with
her
gone
off
where
toto
tabor
island
replied
pencroft
do
you
think
they
would
risk
themselves
in
a
boat
of
such
small
tonnage
we
must
besides
be
sure
that
they
know
of
the
islet
rejoined
the
reporter
however
that
may
be
said
the
sailor
as
sure
as
my
name
is
bonadventure
pencroft
of
the
vineyard
our
bonadventure
has
sailed
without
us
the
sailor
was
positive
that
neither
gideon
spilett
nor
herbert
could
dispute
his
statement
it
was
evident
that
the
vessel
had
been
moved
more
or
less
since
pencroft
had
brought
her
to
port
balloon
as
to
the
sailor
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
anchor
had
been
raised
and
then
dropped
again
now
what
was
the
use
of
these
two
maneuvers
unless
the
vessel
had
been
employed
in
some
expedition
but
how
was
it
we
did
not
see
the
bonadventure
pass
in
the
sight
of
the
island
observed
the
reporter
who
was
anxious
to
bring
forward
every
possible
objection
why
mr
spilett
replied
the
sailor
they
would
only
have
to
start
in
the
night
with
a
good
breeze
and
they
would
be
out
of
sight
of
the
island
in
two
hours
well
resumed
gideon
spilett
i
ask
again
what
object
could
the
convicts
have
had
in
using
the
bonadventure
and
why
after
they
had
made
use
of
her
should
they
have
brought
her
back
to
port
why
mr
spilett
replied
the
sailor
we
must
put
that
among
the
unaccountable
things
and
not
think
anything
more
about
it
the
chief
thing
is
that
the
bonadventure
was
there
and
she
is
there
now
only
unfortunately
if
the
convicts
take
her
a
second
time
we
shall
very
likely
not
find
her
again
in
her
place
then
pencroft
said
herbert
would
it
not
be
wisest
to
bring
the
bonadventure
off
to
granite
house
yes
and
no
answered
pencroft
or
rather
no
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
is
a
bad
place
for
a
vessel
and
the
sea
is
heavy
there
but
by
hauling
her
up
on
the
sand
to
the
foot
of
the
chimneys
perhaps
yes
replied
pencroft
at
any
rate
since
we
must
leave
granite
house
for
a
long
expedition
i
think
the
bonadventure
will
be
safer
here
during
our
absence
and
we
shall
do
best
to
leave
her
here
until
the
island
is
rid
of
these
blackguards
that
is
exactly
my
opinion
said
the
reporter
at
any
rate
in
the
event
of
bad
weather
she
will
not
be
exposed
here
as
she
would
be
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
but
suppose
the
convicts
pay
her
another
visit
said
herbert
well
my
boy
replied
pencroft
not
finding
her
here
they
would
not
be
long
in
finding
her
on
the
sands
of
granite
house
and
during
our
absence
nothing
could
hinder
them
from
seizing
her
i
agree
therefore
with
mr
spilett
that
she
must
be
left
in
port
balloon
but
if
on
our
return
we
have
not
rid
the
island
of
those
rascals
it
will
be
prudent
to
bring
our
boat
to
granite
house
until
the
time
when
we
need
not
fear
any
unpleasant
visits
thats
settled
let
us
be
off
said
the
reporter
pencroft
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
on
their
return
to
granite
house
told
the
engineer
all
that
had
passed
and
the
latter
approved
of
their
arrangements
both
for
the
present
and
the
future
he
also
promised
the
sailor
that
he
would
study
that
part
of
the
channel
situated
between
the
islet
and
the
coast
so
as
to
ascertain
if
it
would
not
be
possible
to
make
an
artificial
harbor
there
by
means
of
dams
in
this
way
the
bonadventure
would
be
always
within
reach
under
the
eyes
of
the
colonists
and
if
necessary
under
lock
and
key
that
evening
a
telegram
was
sent
to
ayrton
requesting
him
to
bring
from
the
corral
a
couple
of
goats
which
neb
wished
to
acclimatize
to
the
plateau
singularly
enough
ayrton
did
not
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
the
despatch
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
this
could
not
but
astonish
the
engineer
but
it
might
be
that
ayrton
was
not
at
that
moment
in
the
corral
or
even
that
he
was
on
his
way
back
to
granite
house
in
fact
two
days
had
already
passed
since
his
departure
and
it
had
been
decided
that
on
the
evening
of
the
10th
or
at
the
latest
the
morning
of
the
11th
he
should
return
the
colonists
waited
therefore
for
ayrton
to
appear
on
prospect
heights
neb
and
herbert
even
watched
at
the
bridge
so
as
to
be
ready
to
lower
it
the
moment
their
companion
presented
himself
but
up
to
ten
in
the
evening
there
were
no
signs
of
ayrton
it
was
therefore
judged
best
to
send
a
fresh
despatch
requiring
an
immediate
reply
the
bell
of
the
telegraph
at
granite
house
remained
mute
the
colonists
uneasiness
was
great
what
had
happened
was
ayrton
no
longer
at
the
corral
or
if
he
was
still
there
had
he
no
longer
control
over
his
movements
could
they
go
to
the
corral
in
this
dark
night
they
consulted
some
wished
to
go
the
others
to
remain
but
said
herbert
perhaps
some
accident
has
happened
to
the
telegraphic
apparatus
so
that
it
works
no
longer
that
may
be
said
the
reporter
wait
till
tomorrow
replied
cyrus
harding
it
is
possible
indeed
that
ayrton
has
not
received
our
despatch
or
even

tried
again

same
result
off
to
the
corral
said
he
and
well
armed
added
pencroft
it
was
immediately
decided
that
granite
house
should
not
be
left
alone
and
that
neb
should
remain
there
after
having
accompanied
his
friends
to
creek
glycerine
he
raised
the
bridge
and
waiting
behind
a
tree
he
watched
for
the
return
of
either
his
companions
or
ayrton
in
the
event
of
the
pirates
presenting
themselves
and
attempting
to
force
the
passage
he
was
to
endeavor
to
stop
them
by
firing
on
them
and
as
a
last
resource
he
was
to
take
refuge
in
granite
house
where
the
lift
once
raised
he
would
be
in
safety
cyrus

gideon
spilett
herbert
and
pencroft
were
to
repair
to
the
corral
and
if
they
did
not
find
ayrton
search
the
neighboring
woods
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
the
engineer
and
his
three
companions
had
passed
creek
glycerine
and
neb
posted
himself
behind
a
small
mound
crowned
by
several
dragon
trees
on
the
left
bank
of
the
stream
the
colonists
after
leaving
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
immediately
took
the
road
to
the
corral
they
shouldered
their
guns
ready
to
fire
on
the
slightest
hostile
demonstration
the
two
rifles
and
the
two
guns
had
been
loaded
with
ball
the
wood
was
thick
on
each
side
of
the
road
and
might
easily
have
concealed
the
convicts
who
owing
to
their
weapons
would
have
been
really
formidable
the
colonists
walked
rapidly
and
in
silence
top
preceded
them
sometimes
running
on
the
road
sometimes
taking
a
ramble
into
the
wood
but
always
quiet
and
not
appearing
to
fear
anything
unusual
and
they
could
be
sure
that
the
faithful
dog
would
not
allow
them
to
be
surprised
but
would
bark
at
the
least
appearance
of
danger
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
followed
beside
the
road
the
wire
which
connected
the
corral
with
granite
house
after
walking
for
nearly
two
miles
they
had
not
as
yet
discovered
any
explanation
of
the
difficulty
the
posts
were
in
good
order
the
wire
regularly
extended
however
at
that
moment
the
engineer
observed
that
the
wire
appeared
to
be
slack
and
on
arriving
at
post
no
74
herbert
who
was
in
advance
stopped
exclaiming
the
wire
is
broken
his
companions
hurried
forward
and
arrived
at
the
spot
where
the
lad
was
standing
the
post
was
rooted
up
and
lying
across
the
path
the
unexpected
explanation
of
the
difficulty
was
here
and
it
was
evident
that
the
despatches
from
granite
house
had
not
been
received
at
the
corral
nor
those
from
the
corral
at
granite
house
it
wasnt
the
wind
that
blew
down
this
post
observed
pencroft
no
replied
gideon
spilett
the
earth
has
been
dug
up
round
its
foot
and
it
has
been
torn
up
by
the
hand
of
man
besides
the
wire
is
broken
added
herbert
showing
that
the
wire
had
been
snapped

the
fracture

harding
yes
answered
herbert
it
has
certainly
been
done
quite
lately

the
corral
to
the
corral
exclaimed
the
sailor
the
colonists
were
now
half
way
between
granite
house
and
the
corral
having
still
two
miles
and
a
half
to
go
they
pressed
forward
with
redoubled
speed
indeed
it
was
to
be
feared
that
some
serious
accident
had
occurred
in
the
corral
no
doubt
ayrton
might
have
sent
a
telegram
which
had
not
arrived
but
this
was
not
the
reason
why
his
companions
were
so
uneasy
for
a
more
unaccountable
circumstance
ayrton
who
had
promised
to
return
the
evening
before
had
not
reappeared
in
short
it
was
not
without
a
motive
that
all
communication
had
been
stopped
between
the
corral
and
granite
house
and
who
but
the
convicts
could
have
any
interest
in
interrupting
this
communication
the
settlers
hastened
on
their
hearts
oppressed
with
anxiety
they
were
sincerely
attached
to
their
new
companion
were
they
to
find
him
struck
down
by
the
hands
of
those
of
whom
he
was
formerly
the
leader
soon
they
arrived
at
the
place
where
the
road
led
along
the
side
of
the
little
stream
which
flowed
from
the
red
creek
and
watered
the
meadows
of
the
corral
they
then
moderated
their
pace
so
that
they
should
not
be
out
of
breath
at
the
moment
when
a
struggle
might
be
necessary
their
guns
were
in
their
hands
ready
cocked
the
forest
was
watched
on
every
side
top
uttered
sullen
groans
which
were
rather
ominous
at
last
the
palisade
appeared
through
the
trees
no
trace
of
any
damage
could
be
seen
the
gate
was
shut
as
usual
deep
silence
reigned
in
the
corral
neither
the
accustomed
bleating
of
the
sheep
nor
ayrtons
voice
could
be
heard
let
us
enter
said
cyrus
harding
and
the
engineer
advanced
while
his
companions
keeping
watch
about
twenty
paces
behind
him
were
ready
to
fire
at
a
moments
notice
harding
raised
the
inner
latch
of
the
gate
and
was
about
to
push
it
back
when
top
barked
loudly
a
report
sounded
and
was
responded
to
by
a
cry
of
pain
herbert
struck
by
a
bullet
lay
stretched
on
the

gideon

ran
to

the

listened
to
ascertain
if
the
poor
lads
heart
was
still
beating
he
lives
said
he
but
he
must
be
carried
to
granite

that
is
impossible
replied
the
engineer
into
the
corral
then
said
pencroft
in
a
moment
said
harding
and
he
ran
round
the
left
corner
of
the
palisade
there
he
found
a
convict
who
aiming
at
him
sent
a
ball
through
his
hat
in
a
few
seconds
before
he
had
even
time
to
fire
his
second
barrel
he
fell
struck
to
the
heart
by

dagger
more
sure
even
than
his
gun
during
this
time
gideon
spilett
and
the
sailor
hoisted
themselves
over
the
palisade
leaped
into
the
enclosure
threw
down
the
props
which
supported
the
inner
door
ran
into
the
empty
house
and
soon
poor
herbert
was
lying
on
ayrtons
bed
in
a
few
moments
harding
was
by
his
side
on
seeing
herbert
senseless
the
sailors
grief
was
terrible
he
sobbed
he
cried
he
tried
to
beat
his
head
against
the
wall
neither
the
engineer
nor
the
reporter
could
calm
him
they
themselves
were
choked
with
emotion
they
could
not
speak
however
they
knew
that
it
depended
on
them
to
rescue
from
death
the
poor
boy
who
was
suffering
beneath
their
eyes
gideon
spilett
had
not
passed
through
the
many
incidents
by
which
his
life
had
been
checkered
without
acquiring
some
slight
knowledge
of
medicine
he
knew
a
little
of
everything
and
several
times
he
had
been
obliged
to
attend
to
wounds
produced
either
by
a
swordbayonet
or
shot
assisted
by
cyrus
harding
he
proceeded
to
render
the
aid
herbert
required
the
reporter
was
immediately
struck
by
the
complete
stupor
in
which
herbert
lay
a
stupor
owing
either
to
the
hemorrhage
or
to
the
shock
the
ball
having
struck
a
bone
with
sufficient
force
to
produce
a
violent
concussion
herbert
was
deadly
pale
and
his
pulse
so
feeble
that
spilett
only
felt
it
beat
at
long
intervals
as
if
it
was
on
the
point
of
stopping
these
symptoms
were
very
serious
herberts
chest
was
laid
bare
and
the
blood
having
been
stanched
with
handkerchiefs
it
was
bathed
with
cold
water
the
contusion
or
rather
the
contused
wound
appearedan
oval
below
the
chest
between
the
third
and
fourth
ribs
it
was
there
that
herbert
had
been
hit
by
the
bullet
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
then
turned
the
poor
boy
over
as
they
did
so
he
uttered
a
moan
so
feeble
that
they
almost
thought
it
was
his
last
sigh
herberts
back
was
covered
with
blood
from
another
contused
wound
by
which
the
ball
had
immediately
escaped
god
be
praised
said
the
reporter
the
ball
is
not
in
the
body
and
we
shall
not
have
to
extract
it
but
the
heart
asked
harding
the
heart
has
not
been
touched
if
it
had
been
herbert
would
be
dead
dead
exclaimed
pencroft
with
a
groan
the
sailor
had
only
heard
the
last
words
uttered
by
the
reporter
no
pencroft
replied
cyrus
harding
no
he
is
not
dead
his
pulse
still
beats
he
has
even
uttered
a
moan
but
for
your
boys
sake
calm
yourself
we
have
need
of
all
our
selfpossession
do
not
make
us
lose
it
my
friend
pencroft
was
silent
but
a
reaction
set
in
and
great
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
in
the
meanwhile
gideon
spilett
endeavored
to
collect
his
ideas
and
proceed
methodically
after
his
examination
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
ball
entering
in
front
between
the
seventh
and
eighth
ribs
had
issued
behind
between
the
third
and
fourth
but
what
mischief
had
the
ball
committed
in
its
passage
what
important
organs
had
been
reached
a
professional
surgeon
would
have
had
difficulty
in
determining
this
at
once
and
still
more
so
the
reporter
however
he
knew
one
thing
this
was
that
he
would
have
to
prevent
the
inflammatory
strangulation
of
the
injured
parts
then
to
contend
with
the
local
inflammation
and
fever
which
would
result
from
the
wound
perhaps
mortal
now
what
styptics
what
antiphlogistics
ought
to
be
employed
by
what
means
could
inflammation
be
prevented
at
any
rate
the
most
important
thing
was
that
the
two
wounds
should
be
dressed
without
delay
it
did
not
appear
necessary
to
gideon
spilett
that
a
fresh
flow
of
blood
should
be
caused
by
bathing
them
in
tepid
water
and
compressing
their
lips
the
hemorrhage
had
been
very
abundant
and
herbert
was
already
too
much
enfeebled
by
the
loss
of
blood
the
reporter
therefore
thought
it
best
to
simply
bathe
the
two
wounds
with
cold
water
herbert
was
placed
on
his
left
side
and
was
maintained
in
that
position
he
must
not
be
moved
said
gideon
spilett
he
is
in
the
most
favorable
position
for
the
wounds
in
his
back
and
chest
to
suppurate
easily
and
absolute
rest
is
necessary
what
cant
we
carry
him
to
granite
house
asked
pencroft
no
pencroft
replied
the
reporter
ill
pay
the
villains
off
cried
the
sailor
shaking
his
fist
in
a
menacing
manner
pencroft
said
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
had
resumed
his
examination
of
the
wounded
boy
herbert
was
still
so
frightfully
pale
that
the
reporter
felt
anxious
cyrus
said
he
i
am
not
a
surgeon
i
am
in
terrible
perplexity
you
must
aid
me
with
your
advice
your
experience
take
courage
my
friend
answered
the
engineer
pressing
the
reporters
hand
judge
coolly
think
only
of
this
herbert
must
be
saved
these
words
restored
to
gideon
spilett
that
selfpossession
which
he
had
lost
in
a
moment
of
discouragement
on
feeling
his
great
responsibility
he
seated
himself
close
to
the
bed
cyrus
harding
stood
near
pencroft
had
torn
up
his
shirt
and
was
mechanically
making
lint
spilett
then
explained
to
cyrus
harding
that
he
thought
he
ought
first
of
all
to
stop
the
hemorrhage
but
not
close
the
two
wounds
or
cause
their
immediate
cicatrization
for
there
had
been
internal
perforation
and
the
suppuration
must
not
be
allowed
to
accumulate
in
the
chest
harding
approved
entirely
and
it
was
decided
that
the
two
wounds
should
be
dressed
without
attempting
to
close
them
by
immediate
coaptation
and
now
did
the
colonists
possess
an
efficacious
agent
to
act
against
the
inflammation
which
might
occur
yes
they
had
one
for
nature
had
generously
lavished
it
they
had
cold
water
that
is
to
say
the
most
powerful
sedative
that
can
be
employed
against
inflammation
of
wounds
the
most
efficacious
therapeutic
agent
in
grave
cases
and
the
one
which
is
now
adopted
by
all
physicians
cold
water
has
moreover
the
advantage
of
leaving
the
wound
in
absolute
rest
and
preserving
it
from
all
premature
dressing
a
considerable
advantage
since
it
has
been
found
by
experience
that
contact
with
the
air
is
dangerous
during
the
first
days
gideon
spilett
and
cyrus
harding
reasoned
thus
with
their
simple
good
sense
and
they
acted
as
the
best
surgeon
would
have
done
compresses
of
linen
were
applied
to
poor
herberts
two
wounds
and
were
kept
constantly
wet
with
cold
water
the
sailor
had
at
first
lighted
a
fire
in
the
hut
which
was
not
wanting
in
things
necessary
for
life
maple
sugar
medicinal
plants
the
same
which
the
lad
had
gathered
on
the
banks
of
lake
grant
enabled
them
to
make
some
refreshing
drinks
which
they
gave
him
without
his
taking
any
notice
of
it
his
fever
was
extremely
high
and
all
that
day
and
night
passed
without
his
becoming
conscious
herberts
life
hung
on
a
thread
and
this
thread
might
break
at
any
moment
the
next
day
the
12th
of
november
the
hopes
of
harding
and
his
companions
slightly
revived
herbert
had
come
out
of
his
long
stupor
he
opened
his
eyes
he
recognized
cyrus
harding
the
reporter
and
pencroft
he
uttered
two
or
three
words
he
did
not
know
what
had
happened
they
told
him
and
spilett
begged
him
to
remain
perfectly
still
telling
him
that
his
life
was
not
in
danger
and
that
his
wounds
would
heal
in
a
few
days
however
herbert
scarcely
suffered
at
all
and
the
cold
water
with
which
they
were
constantly
bathed
prevented
any
inflammation
of
the
wounds
the
suppuration
was
established
in
a
regular
way
the
fever
did
not
increase
and
it
might
now
be
hoped
that
this
terrible
wound
would
not
involve
any
catastrophe
pencroft
felt
the
swelling
of
his
heart
gradually
subside
he
was
like
a
sister
of
mercy
like
a
mother
by
the
bed
of
her
child
herbert
dozed
again
but
his
sleep
appeared
more
natural
tell
me
again
that
you
hope
mr
spilett
said
pencroft
tell
me
again
that
you
will
save
herbert
yes
we
will
save
him
replied
the
reporter
the
wound
is
serious
and
perhaps
even
the
ball
has
traversed
the
lungs
but
the
perforation
of
this
organ
is
not
fatal
god
bless
you
answered
pencroft
as
may
be
believed
during
the
fourandtwenty
hours
they
had
been
in
the
corral
the
colonists
had
no
other
thought
than
that
of
nursing
herbert
they
did
not
think
either
of
the
danger
which
threatened
them
should
the
convicts
return
or
of
the
precautions
to
be
taken
for
the
future
but
on
this
day
while
pencroft
watched
by
the
sickbed
cyrus
harding
and
the
reporter
consulted
as
to
what
it
would
be
best
to
do
first
of
all
they
examined
the
corral
there
was
not
a
trace
of
ayrton
had
the
unhappy
man
been
dragged
away
by
his
former
accomplices
had
he
resisted
and
been
overcome
in
the
struggle
this
last
supposition
was
only
too
probable
gideon
spilett
at
the
moment
he
scaled
the
palisade
had
clearly
seen
some
one
of
the
convicts
running
along
the
southern
spur
of
mount
franklin
towards
whom
top
had
sprung
it
was
one
of
those
whose
object
had
been
so
completely
defeated
by
the
rocks
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
besides
the
one
killed
by
harding
and
whose
body
was
found
outside
the
enclosure
of
course
belonged
to
bob
harveys
crew
as
to
the
corral
it
had
not
suffered
any
damage
the
gates
were
closed
and
the
animals
had
not
been
able
to
disperse
in
the
forest
nor
could
they
see
traces
of
any
struggle
any
devastation
either
in
the
hut
or
in
the
palisade
the
ammunition
only
with
which
ayrton
had
been
supplied
had
disappeared
with
him
the
unhappy
man
has
been
surprised
said
harding
and
as
he
was
a
man
to
defend
himself
he
must
have
been
overpowered
yes
that
is
to
be
feared
said
the
reporter
then
doubtless
the
convicts
installed
themselves
in
the
corral
where
they
found
plenty
of
everything
and
only
fled
when
they
saw
us
coming
it
is
very
evident
too
that
at
this
moment
ayrton
whether
living
or
dead
is
not
here
we
shall
have
to
beat
the
forest
said
the
engineer
and
rid
the
island
of
these
wretches
pencrofts
presentiments
were
not
mistaken
when
he
wished
to
hunt
them
as
wild
beasts
that
would
have
spared
us
all
these
misfortunes
yes
answered
the
reporter
but
now
we
have
the
right
to
be
merciless
at
any
rate
said
the
engineer
we
are
obliged
to
wait
some
time
and
to
remain
at
the
corral
until
we
can
carry
herbert
without
danger
to
granite
house
but
neb
asked
the
reporter
neb
is
in
safety
but
if
uneasy
at
our
absence
he
would
venture
to
come
he
must
not
come
returned
cyrus
harding
quickly
he
would
be
murdered
on
the
road
it
is
very
probable
however
that
he
will
attempt
to
rejoin
us
ah
if
the
telegraph
still
acted
he
might
be
warned
but
that
is
impossible
now
as
to
leaving
pencroft
and
herbert
here
alone
we
could
not
do
it
well
i
will
go
alone
to
granite
house
no
no
cyrus
answered
the
reporter
you
must
not
expose
yourself
your
courage
would
be
of
no
avail
the
villains
are
evidently
watching
the
corral
they
are
hidden
in
the
thick
woods
which
surround
it
and
if
you
go
we
shall
soon
have
to
regret
two
misfortunes
instead
of
one
but
neb
repeated
the
engineer
it
is
now
fourandtwenty
hours
since
he
has
had
any
news
of
us
he
will
be
sure
to
come
and
as
he
will
be
less
on
his
guard
than
we
should
be
ourselves
added
spilett
he
will
be
killed
is
there
really
no
way
of
warning
him
while
the
engineer
thought
his
eyes
fell
on
top
who
going
backwards
and
forwards
seemed
to
say
am
not

exclaimed
cyrus
harding
the
animal
sprang
at
his
masters
call
yes
top
will
go
said
the
reporter
who
had
understood
the
engineer
top
can
go
where
we
cannot
he
will
carry
to
granite
house
the
news
of
the
corral
and
he
will
bring
back
to
us
that
from
granite
house
quick
said
harding
quick
spilett
rapidly
tore
a
leaf
from
his
notebook
and
wrote
these
words
herbert
wounded
we
are
at
the
corral

not
leave

the
convicts
appeared
in
the
neighborhood
reply
by
top
this
laconic
note
contained
all
that
neb
ought
to
know
and
at
the
same
time
asked
all

the
colonists
wished
to

folded
and
fastened
to

the

caressing
the
animal

bounded
at
these
words
he
understood
he
knew
what
was
expected
of
him
the
road
to
the
corral
was
familiar
to
him
in
less
than
an
hour
he
could
clear
it
and
it
might
be
hoped
that
where
neither
cyrus
harding
nor
the
reporter
could
have
ventured
without
danger
top
running
among
the
grass
or
in
the
wood
would
pass
unperceived
the
engineer
went
to
the
gate
of
the
corral
and
opened
it

repeated
the
engineer
again
pointing
in
the
direction
of

top
sprang
forwards
then
almost
immediately
disappeared
he
will
get
there
said
the
reporter
yes
and
he
will
come
back
the
faithful
animal
what
oclock
is
it
asked
gideon
spilett
ten
in
an
hour
he
may
be
here
we
will
watch
for
his
return
the
gate
of
the
corral
was
closed
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
reentered
the
house
herbert
was
still
in
a
sleep
pencroft
kept
the
compresses
always
wet
spilett
seeing
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
at
that
moment
busied
himself
in
preparing
some
nourishment
while
attentively
watching
that
part
of
the
enclosure
against
the
hill
at
which
an
attack
might
be
expected
the
settlers
awaited
tops
return
with
much
anxiety
a
little
before
eleven
oclock
cyrus
harding
and
the
reporter
rifle
in
hand
were
behind
the
gate
ready
to
open
it
at
the
first
bark
of
their
dog
they
did
not
doubt
that
if
top
had
arrived
safely
at
granite
house
neb
would
have
sent
him
back
immediately
they
had
both
been
there
for
about
ten
minutes
when
a
report
was
heard
followed
by
repeated
barks
the
engineer
opened
the
gate
and
seeing
smoke
a
hundred
feet
off
in
the
wood
he
fired
in
that
direction
almost
immediately
top
bounded
into
the

the

the

taking

chapter
8
so
the
convicts
were
still
there
watching
the
corral
and
determined
to
kill
the
settlers
one
after
the
other
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
treat
them
as
wild
beasts
but
great
precautions
must
be
taken
for
just
now
the
wretches
had
the
advantage
on
their
side
seeing
and
not
being
seen
being
able
to
surprise
by
the
suddenness
of
their
attack
yet
not
to
be
surprised
themselves
harding
made
arrangements
therefore
for
living
in
the
corral
of
which
the
provisions
would
last
for
a
tolerable
length
of
time
ayrtons
house
had
been
provided
with
all
that
was
necessary
for
existence
and
the
convicts
scared
by
the
arrival
of
the
settlers
had
not
had
time
to
pillage
it
it
was
probable
as
gideon
spilett
observed
that
things
had
occurred
as
follows
the
six
convicts
disembarking
on
the
island
had
followed
the
southern
shore
and
after
having
traversed
the
double
shore
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
not
being
inclined
to
venture
into
the
far
west
woods
they
had
reached
the
mouth
of
falls
river
from
this
point
by
following
the
right
bank
of
the
watercourse
they
would
arrive
at
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
among
which
they
would
naturally
seek
a
retreat
and
they
could
not
have
been
long
in
discovering
the
corral
then
uninhabited
there
they
had
regularly
installed
themselves
awaiting
the
moment
to
put
their
abominable
schemes
into
execution
ayrtons
arrival
had
surprised
them
but
they
had
managed
to
overpower
the
unfortunate
man
andthe
rest
may
be
easily
imagined
now
the
convictsreduced
to
five
it
is
true
but
well
armedwere
roaming
the
woods
and
to
venture
there
was
to
expose
themselves
to
their
attacks
which
could
be
neither
guarded
against
nor
prevented
wait
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
repeated
cyrus
harding
when
herbert
is
cured
we
can
organize
a
general
battle
of
the
island
and
have
satisfaction
of
these
convicts
that
will
be
the
object
of
our
grand
expedition
at
the
same
time
as
the
search
for
our
mysterious
protector
added
gideon
spilett
finishing
the
engineers
sentence
and
it
must
be
acknowledged
my
dear
cyrus
that
this
time
his
protection
was
wanting
at
the
very
moment
when
it
was
most
necessary
to
us
who
knows
replied
the
engineer
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
reporter
that
we
are
not
at
the
end
of
our
trouble
yet
my
dear
spilett
and
that
his
powerful
intervention
may
have
another
opportunity
of
exercising
itself
but
that
is
not
the
question
now
herberts
life
before
everything
this
was
the
colonists
saddest
thought
several
days
passed
and
the
poor
boys
state
was
happily
no
worse
cold
water
always
kept
at
a
suitable
temperature
had
completely
prevented
the
inflammation
of
the
wounds
it
even
seemed
to
the
reporter
that
this
water
being
slightly
sulphurouswhich
was
explained
by
the
neighborhood
of
the
volcano
had
a
more
direct
action
on
the
healing
the
suppuration
was
much
less
abundant
and
thanks
to
the
incessant
care
by
which
he
was
surroundedherbert
returned
to
life
and
his
fever
abated
he
was
besides
subjected
to
a
severe
diet
and
consequently
his
weakness
was
and
would
be
extreme
but
there
was
no
want
of
refreshing
drinks
and
absolute
rest
was
of
the
greatest
benefit
to
him
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
and
pencroft
had
become
very
skilful
in
dressing
the
lads

all
the
linen

herberts
wounds
covered
with
compresses
and
lint
were
pressed
neither
too
much
nor
too
little
so
as
to
cause
their
cicatrization
without
effecting
any
inflammatory
reaction
the
reporter
used
extreme
care
in
the
dressing
knowing
well
the
importance
of
it
and
repeating
to
his
companions
that
which
most
surgeons
willingly
admit
that
it
is
perhaps
rarer
to
see
a
dressing
well
done
than
an
operation
well
performed
in
ten
days
on
the
22nd
of
november
herbert
was
considerably
better
he
had
begun
to
take
some
nourishment
the
color
was
returning
to
his
cheeks
and
his
bright
eyes
smiled
at
his
nurses
he
talked
a
little
notwithstanding
pencrofts
efforts
who
talked
incessantly
to
prevent
him
from
beginning
to
speak
and
told
him
the
most
improbable
stories
herbert
had
questioned
him
on
the
subject
of
ayrton
whom
he
was
astonished
not
to
see
near
him
thinking
that
he
was
at
the
corral
but
the
sailor
not
wishing
to
distress
herbert
contented
himself
by
replying
that
ayrton
had
rejoined

so
as
to
defend
granite
house
humph
said
pencroft
these
pirates
they
are
gentlemen
who
have
no
right
to
any
consideration
and
the
captain
wanted
to
win
them
by
kindness
ill
send
them
some
kindness
but
in
the
shape
of
a
good
bullet
and
have
they
not
been
seen
again
asked
herbert
no
my
boy
answered
the
sailor
but
we
shall
find
them
and
when
you
are
cured
we
shall
see
if
the
cowards
who
strike
us
from
behind
will
dare
to
meet
us
face
to
face
i
am
still
very
weak
my
poor
pencroft
well
your
strength
will
return
gradually
whats
a
ball
through
the
chest
nothing
but
a
joke
ive
seen
many
and
i
dont
think
much
of
them
at
last
things
appeared
to
be
going
on
well
and
if
no
complication
occurred
herberts
recovery
might
be
regarded
as
certain
but
what
would
have
been
the
condition
of
the
colonists
if
his
state
had
been
aggravatedif
for
example
the
ball
had
remained
in
his
body
if
his
arm
or
his
leg
had
had
to
be
amputated
no
said
spilett
more
than
once
i
have
never
thought
of
such
a
contingency
without
shuddering
and
yet
if
it
had
been
necessary
to
operate
said
harding
one
day
to
him
you
would
not
have
hesitated
no
cyrus
said
gideon
spilett
but
thank
god
that
we
have
been
spared
this
complication
as
in
so
many
other
conjectures
the
colonists
had
appealed
to
the
logic
of
that
simple
good
sense
of
which
they
had
made
use
so
often
and
once
more
thanks
to
their
general
knowledge
it
had
succeeded
but
might
not
a
time
come
when
all
their
science
would
be
at
fault
they
were
alone
on
the
island
now
men
in
all
states
of
society
are
necessary
to
each
other
cyrus
harding
knew
this
well
and
sometimes
he
asked
if
some
circumstance
might
not
occur
which
they
would
be
powerless
to
surmount
it
appeared
to
him
besides
that
he
and
his
companions
till
then
so
fortunate
had
entered
into
an
unlucky
period
during
the
two
years
and
a
half
which
had
elapsed
since
their
escape
from
richmond
it
might
be
said
that
they
had
had
everything
their
own
way
the
island
had
abundantly
supplied
them
with
minerals
vegetables
animals
and
as
nature
had
constantly
loaded
them
their
science
had
known
how
to
take
advantage
of
what
she
offered
them
the
wellbeing
of
the
colony
was
therefore
complete
moreover
in
certain
occurrences
an
inexplicable
influence
had
come
to
their
aid
but
all
that
could
only
be
for
a
time
in
short
cyrus
harding
believed
that
fortune
had
turned
against
them
in
fact
the
convicts
ship
had
appeared
in
the
waters
of
the
island
and
if
the
pirates
had
been
so
to
speak
miraculously
destroyed
six
of
them
at
least
had
escaped
the
catastrophe
they
had
disembarked
on
the
island
and
it
was
almost
impossible
to
get
at
the
five
who
survived
ayrton
had
no
doubt
been
murdered
by
these
wretches
who
possessed
firearms
and
at
the
first
use
that
they
had
made
of
them
herbert
had
fallen
wounded
almost
mortally
were
these
the
first
blows
aimed
by
adverse
fortune
at
the
colonists
this
was
often
asked
by
harding
this
was
often
repeated
by
the
reporter
and
it
appeared
to
him
also
that
the
intervention
so
strange
yet
so
efficacious
which
till
then
had
served
them
so
well
had
now
failed
them
had
this
mysterious
being
whatever
he
was
whose
existence
could
not
be
denied
abandoned
the
island
had
he
in
his
turn
succumbed
no
reply
was
possible
to
these
questions
but
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
because
harding
and
his
companions
spoke
of
these
things
they
were
men
to
despair
far
from
that
they
looked
their
situation
in
the
face
they
analyzed
the
chances
they
prepared
themselves
for
any
event
they
stood
firm
and
straight
before
the
future
and
if
adversity
was
at
last
to
strike
them
it
would
find
in
them
men
prepared
to
struggle
against
it
chapter
9
the
convalescence
of
the
young
invalid
was
regularly
progressing
one
thing
only
was
now
to
be
desired
that
his
state
would
allow
him
to
be
brought
to
granite
house
however
well
built
and
supplied
the
corral
house
was
it
could
not
be
so
comfortable
as
the
healthy
granite
dwelling
besides
it
did
not
offer
the
same
security
and
its
tenants
notwithstanding
their
watchfulness
were
here
always
in
fear
of
some
shot
from
the
convicts
there
on
the
contrary
in
the
middle
of
that
impregnable
and
inaccessible
cliff
they
would
have
nothing
to
fear
and
any
attack
on
their
persons
would
certainly
fail
they
therefore
waited
impatiently
for
the
moment
when
herbert
might
be
moved
without
danger
from
his
wound
and
they
were
determined
to
make
this
move
although
the
communication
through
jacamar
wood
was
very
difficult
they
had
no
news
from
neb
but
were
not
uneasy
on
that
account
the
courageous
negro
well
entrenched
in
the
depths
of
granite
house
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
surprised
top
had
not
been
sent
again
to
him
as
it
appeared
useless
to
expose
the
faithful
dog
to
some
shot
which
might
deprive
the
settlers
of
their
most
useful
auxiliary
they
waited
therefore
although
they
were
anxious
to
be
reunited
at
granite
house
it
pained
the
engineer
to
see
his
forces
divided
for
it
gave
great
advantage
to
the
pirates
since
ayrtons
disappearance
they
were
only
four
against
five
for
herbert
could
not
yet
be
counted
and
this
was
not
the
least
care
of
the
brave
boy
who
well
understood
the
trouble
of
which
he
was
the
cause
the
question
of
knowing
how
in
their
condition
they
were
to
act
against
the
pirates
was
thoroughly
discussed
on
the
29th
of
november
by
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
and
pencroft
at
a
moment
when
herbert
was
asleep
and
could
not
hear
them
my
friends
said
the
reporter
after
they
had
talked
of
neb
and
of
the
impossibility
of
communicating
with
him
i
thinklike
you
that
to
venture
on
the
road
to
the
corral
would
be
to
risk
receiving
a
gunshot
without
being
able
to
return
it
but
do
you
not
think
that
the
best
thing
to
be
done
now
is
to
openly
give
chase
to
these
wretches
that
is
just
what
i
was
thinking
answered
pencroft
i
believe
were
not
fellows
to
be
afraid
of
a
bullet
and
as
for
me
if
captain
harding
approves
im
ready
to
dash
into
the
forest
why
hang
it
one
man
is
equal
to
another
but
is
he
equal
to
five
asked
the
engineer
i
will
join
pencroft
said
the
reporter
and
both
of
us
wellarmed
and
accompanied
by
top
my
dear
spilett
and
you
pencroft
answered
harding
let
us
reason
coolly
if
the
convicts
were
hid
in
one
spot
of
the
island
if
we
knew
that
spot
and
had
only
to
dislodge
them
i
would
undertake
a
direct
attack
but
is
there
not
occasion
to
fear
on
the
contrary
that
they
are
sure
to
fire
the
first
shot
well
captain
cried
pencroft
a
bullet
does
not
always
reach
its
mark
that
which
struck
herbert
did
not
miss
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
besides
observe
that
if
both
of
you
left
the
corral
i
should
remain
here
alone
to
defend
it
do
you
imagine
that
the
convicts
will
not
see
you
leave
it
that
they
will
not
allow
you
to
enter
the
forest
and
that
they
will
not
attack
it
during
your
absence
knowing
that
there
is
no
one
here
but
a
wounded
boy
and
a
man
you
are
right
captain
replied
pencroft
his
chest
swelling
with
sullen
anger
you
are
right
they
will
do
all
they
can
to
retake
the
corral
which
they
know
to
be
well
stored
and
alone
you
could
not
hold
it
against
them
oh
if
we
were
only
at
granite
house
if
we
were
at
granite
house
answered
the
engineer
the
case
would
be
very
different
there
i
should
not
be
afraid
to
leave
herbert
with
one
while
the
other
three
went
to
search
the
forests
of
the
island
but
we
are
at
the
corral
and
it
is
best
to
stay
here
until
we
can
leave
it
together
cyrus
hardings
reasoning
was
unanswerable
and
his
companions
understood
it
well
if
only
ayrton
was
still
one
of
us
said
gideon
spilett
poor
fellow
his
return
to
social
life
will
have
been
but
of
short
duration
if
he
is
dead
added
pencroft
in
a
peculiar
tone
do
you
hope
then
pencroft
that
the
villains
have
spared
him
asked
gideon
spilett
yes
if
they
had
any
interest
in
doing
so
what
you
suppose
that
ayrton
finding
his
old
companions
forgetting
all
that
he
owes
us
who
knows
answered
the
sailor
who
did
not
hazard
this
shameful
supposition
without
hesitating
pencroft
said
harding
taking
the
sailors
arm
that
is
a
wicked
idea
of
yours
and
you
will
distress
me
much
if
you
persist
in
speaking
thus
i
will
answer
for
ayrtons
fidelity
and
i
also
added
the
reporter
quickly
yes
yes
captain
i
was
wrong
replied
pencroft
it
was
a
wicked
idea
indeed
that
i
had
and
nothing
justifies
it
but
what
can
i
do
im
not
in
my
senses
this
imprisonment
in
the
corral
wearies
me
horribly
and
i
have
never
felt
so
excited
as
i
do
now
be
patient
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
how
long
will
it
be
my
dear
spilett
before
you
think
herbert
may
be
carried
to
granite
house
that
is
difficult
to
say
cyrus
answered
the
reporter
for
any
imprudence
might
involve
terrible
consequences
but
his
convalescence
is
progressing
and
if
he
continues
to
gain
strength
in
eight
days
from
nowwell
we
shall
see
eight
days
that
would
put
off
the
return
to
granite
house
until
the
first
days
of
december
at
this
time
two
months
of
spring
had
already
passed
the
weather
was
fine
and
the
heat
began
to
be
great
the
forests
of
the
island
were
in
full
leaf
and
the
time
was
approaching
when
the
usual
crops
ought
to
be
gathered
the
return
to
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
would
therefore
be
followed
by
extensive
agricultural
labors
interrupted
only
by
the
projected
expedition
through
the
island
it
can
therefore
be
well
understood
how
injurious
this
seclusion
in
the
corral
must
have
been
to
the
colonists
but
if
they
were
compelled
to
bow
before
necessity
they
did
not
do
so
without
impatience
once
or
twice
the
reporter
ventured
out
into
the
road
and
made
the
tour
of
the
palisade
top
accompanied
him
and
gideon
spilett
his
gun
cocked
was
ready
for
any
emergency
he
met
with
no
misadventure
and
found
no
suspicious
traces
his
dog
would
have
warned
him
of
any
danger
and
as
top
did
not
bark
it
might
be
concluded
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
at
the
moment
at
least
and
that
the
convicts
were
occupied
in
another
part
of
the
island
however
on
his
second
sortie
on
the
27th
of
november
gideon
spilett
who
had
ventured
a
quarter
of
a
mile
into
the
woods
towards
the
south
of
the
mountain
remarked
that
top
scented
something
the
dog
had
no
longer
his
unconcerned
manner
he
went
backwards
and
forwards
ferreting
among
the
grass
and
bushes
as
if
his
smell
had
revealed
some
suspicious
object
to
him
gideon
spilett
followed
top
encouraged
him
excited
him
by
his
voice
while
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
his
gun
ready
to
fire
and
sheltering
himself
behind
the
trees
it
was
not
probable
that
top
scented
the
presence
of
man
for
in
that
case
he
would
have
announced
it
by
halfuttered
sullen
angry
barks
now
as
he
did
not
growl
it
was
because
danger
was
neither
near
nor
approaching
nearly
five
minutes
passed
thus
top
rummaging
the
reporter
following
him
prudently
when
all
at
once
the
dog
rushed
towards
a
thick
bush
and
drew
out
a
rag
it
was
a
piece
of
cloth
stained
and
torn
which
spilett
immediately
brought
back
to
the
corral
there
it
was
examined
by
the
colonists
who
found
that
it
was
a
fragment
of
ayrtons
waistcoat
a
piece
of
that
felt
manufactured
solely
by
the
granite
house
factory
you
see
pencroft
observed
harding
there
has
been
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
unfortunate
ayrton
the
convicts
have
dragged
him
away
in
spite
of
himself
do
you
still
doubt
his
honesty
no
captain
answered
the
sailor
and
i
repented
of
my
suspicion
a
long
time
ago
but
it
seems
to
me
that
something
may
be
learned
from
the
incident
what
is
that
asked
the
reporter
it
is
that
ayrton
was
not
killed
at
the
corral
that
they
dragged
him
away
living
since
he
has
resisted
therefore
perhaps
he
is
still
living
perhaps
indeed
replied
the
engineer
who
remained
thoughtful
this
was
a
hope
to
which
ayrtons
companions
could
still
hold
indeed
they
had
before
believed
that
surprised
in
the
corral
ayrton
had
fallen
by
a
bullet
as
herbert
had
fallen
but
if
the
convicts
had
not
killed
him
at
first
if
they
had
brought
him
living
to
another
part
of
the
island
might
it
not
be
admitted
that
he
was
still
their
prisoner
perhaps
even
one
of
them
had
found
in
ayrton
his
old
australian
companion
ben
joyce
the
chief
of
the
escaped
convicts
and
who
knows
but
that
they
had
conceived
the
impossible
hope
of
bringing
back
ayrton
to
themselves
he
would
have
been
very
useful
to
them
if
they
had
been
able
to
make
him
turn
traitor
this
incident
was
therefore
favorably
interpreted
at
the
corral
and
it
no
longer
appeared
impossible
that
they
should
find
ayrton
again
on
his
side
if
he
was
only
a
prisoner
ayrton
would
no
doubt
do
all
he
could
to
escape
from
the
hands
of
the
villains
and
this
would
be
a
powerful
aid
to
the
settlers
at
any
rate
observed
gideon
spilett
if
happily
ayrton
did
manage
to
escape
he
would
go
directly
to
granite
house
for
he
could
not
know
of
the
attempted
assassination
of
which
herbert
has
been
a
victim
and
consequently
would
never
think
of
our
being
imprisoned
in
the
corral
oh
i
wish
that
he
was
there
at
granite
house
cried
pencroft
and
that
we
were
there
too
for
although
the
rascals
can
do
nothing
to
our
house
they
may
plunder
the
plateau
our
plantations
our
poultryyard
pencroft
had
become
a
thorough
farmer
heartily
attached
to
his
crops
but
it
must
be
said
that
herbert
was
more
anxious
than
any
to
return
to
granite
house
for
he
knew
how
much
the
presence
of
the
settlers
was
needed
there
and
it
was
he
who
was
keeping
them
at
the
corral
therefore
one
idea
occupied
his
mindto
leave
the
corral
and
when
he
believed
he
could
bear
removal
to
granite
house
he
was
sure
his
strength
would
return
more
quickly
in
his
room
with
the
air
and
sight
of
the
sea
several
times
he
pressed
gideon
spilett
but
the
latter
fearing
with
good
reason
that
herberts
wounds
half
healed
might
reopen
on
the
way
did
not
give
the
order
to
start
however
something
occurred
which
compelled
cyrus
harding
and
his
two
friends
to
yield
to
the
lads
wish
and
god
alone
knew
that
this
determination
might
cause
them
grief
and
remorse
it
was
the
29th
of
november
seven
oclock
in
the
evening
the
three
settlers
were
talking
in
herberts
room
when
they
heard
top
utter
quick
barks
harding
pencroft
and
spilett
seized
their
guns
and
ran
out
of
the
house
top
at
the
foot
of
the
palisade
was
jumping
barking
but
it
was
with
pleasure
not
anger
some
one
is
coming
yes
it
is
not
an
enemy
neb
perhaps
or
ayrton
these
words
had
hardly
been
exchanged
between
the
engineer
and
his
two
companions
when
a
body
leaped
over
the
palisade
and
fell
on
the
ground
inside
the
corral
it
was
jup
master
jup
in
person
to
whom
top
immediately
gave
a
most
cordial
reception
jup
exclaimed
pencroft
neb
has
sent
him
to
us
said
the
reporter
then
replied
the
engineer
he
must
have
some
note
on
him
pencroft
rushed
up
to
the
orang
certainly
if
neb
had
any
important
matter
to
communicate
to
his
master
he
could
not
employ
a
more
sure
or
more
rapid
messenger
who
could
pass
where
neither
the
colonists
could
nor
even
top
himself
cyrus
harding
was
not
mistaken
at
jups
neck
hung
a
small
bag
and
in
this
bag
was
found
a
little
note
traced
by
nebs
hand
the
despair
of
harding
and
his
companions
may
be
imagined
when
they
read
these
words
friday
six
oclock
in
the
morning
plateau
invaded
by
convicts
neb
they
gazed
at
each
other
without
uttering
a
word
then
they
reentered
the
house
what
were
they
to
do
the
convicts
on
prospect
heights
that
was
disaster
devastation
ruin
herbert
on
seeing
the
engineer
the
reporter
and
pencroft
reenter
guessed
that
their
situation
was
aggravated
and
when
he
saw
jup
he
no
longer
doubted
that
some
misfortune
menaced
granite
house
captain
harding
said
he
i
must
go
i
can
bear
the
journey
i
must
go
gideon
spilett
approached
herbert
then
having
looked
at
him
let
us
go
then
said
he
the
question
was
quickly
decided
whether
herbert
should
be
carried
on
a
litter
or
in
the
cart
which
had
brought
ayrton
to
the
corral
the
motion
of
the
litter
would
have
been
more
easy
for
the
wounded
lad
but
it
would
have
necessitated
two
bearers
that
is
to
say
there
would
have
been
two
guns
less
for
defense
if
an
attack
was
made
on
the
road
would
they
not
on
the
contrary
by
employing
the
cart
leave
every
arm
free
was
it
impossible
to
place
the
mattress
on
which
herbert
was
lying
in
it
and
to
advance
with
so
much
care
that
any
jolt
should
be
avoided
it
could
be
done
the
cart
was
brought
pencroft
harnessed
the
onager
cyrus
harding
and
the
reporter
raised
herberts
mattress
and
placed
it
on
the
bottom
of
the
cart
the
weather
was
fine
the
suns
bright
rays
glanced
through
the
trees
are
the
guns
ready
asked
cyrus
harding
they
were
the
engineer
and
pencroft
each
armed
with
a
doublebarreled
gun
and
gideon
spilett
carrying
his
rifle
had
nothing
to
do
but
start
are
you
comfortable
herbert
asked
the
engineer
ah
captain
replied
the
lad
dont
be
uneasy
i
shall
not
die
on
the
road
while
speaking
thus
it
could
be
seen
that
the
poor
boy
had
called
up
all
his
energy
and
by
the
energy
of
a
powerful
will
had
collected
his
failing
strength
the
engineer
felt
his
heart
sink
painfully
he
still
hesitated
to
give
the
signal
for
departure
but
that
would
have
driven
herbert
to
despairkilled
him
perhaps
forward
said
harding
the
gate
of
the
corral
was
opened
jup
and
top
who
knew
when
to
be
silent
ran
in
advance
the
cart
came
out
the
gate
was
reclosed
and
the
onager
led
by
pencroft
advanced
at
a
slow
pace
certainly
it
would
have
been
safer
to
have
taken
a
different
road
than
that
which
led
straight
from
the
corral
to
granite
house
but
the
cart
would
have
met
with
great
difficulties
in
moving
under
the
trees
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
follow
this
way
although
it
was
well
known
to
the
convicts
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
walked
one
on
each
side
of
the
cart
ready
to
answer
to
any
attack
however
it
was
not
probable
that
the
convicts
would
have
yet
left
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
nebs
note
had
evidently
been
written
and
sent
as
soon
as
the
convicts
had
shown
themselves
there
now
this
note
was
dated
six
oclock
in
the
morning
and
the
active
orang
accustomed
to
come
frequently
to
the
corral
had
taken
scarcely
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
cross
the
five
miles
which
separated
it
from
granite
house
they
would
therefore
be
safe
at
that
time
and
if
there
was
any
occasion
for
firing
it
would
probably
not
be
until
they
were
in
the
neighborhood
of
granite
house
however
the
colonists
kept
a
strict
watch
top
and
jup
the
latter
armed
with
his
club
sometimes
in
front
sometimes
beating
the
wood
at
the
sides
of
the
road
signalized
no
danger
the
cart
advanced
slowly
under
pencrofts
guidance
it
had
left
the
corral
at
halfpast
seven
an
hour
after
four
out
of
the
five
miles
had
been
cleared
without
any
incident
having
occurred
the
road
was
as
deserted
as
all
that
part
of
the
jacamar
wood
which
lay
between
the
mercy
and
the
lake
there
was
no
occasion
for
any
warning
the
wood
appeared
as
deserted
as
on
the
day
when
the
colonists
first
landed
on
the
island
they
approached
the
plateau
another
mile
and
they
would
see
the
bridge
over
creek
glycerine
cyrus
harding
expected
to
find
it
in
its
place
supposing
that
the
convicts
would
have
crossed
it
and
that
after
having
passed
one
of
the
streams
which
enclosed
the
plateau
they
would
have
taken
the
precaution
to
lower
it
again
so
as
to
keep
open
a
retreat
at
length
an
opening
in
the
trees
allowed
the
seahorizon
to
be
seen
but
the
cart
continued
its
progress
for
not
one
of
its
defenders
thought
of
abandoning
it
at
that
moment
pencroft
stopped
the
onager
and
in
a
hoarse
voice
oh
the
villains
he
exclaimed
and
he
pointed
to
a
thick
smoke
rising
from
the
mill
the
sheds
and
the
buildings
at
the
poultryyard
a
man
was
moving
about
in
the
midst
of
the
smoke
it
was
neb
his
companions
uttered
a
shout
he
heard
and
ran
to
meet
them
the
convicts
had
left
the
plateau
nearly
halfanhour
before
having
devastated
it
and
mr
herbert
asked
neb
gideon
spilett
returned
to
the
cart
herbert
had
lost
consciousness
chapter
10
of
the
convicts
the
dangers
which
menaced
granite
house
the
ruins
with
which
the
plateau
was
covered
the
colonists
thought
no
longer
herberts
critical
state
outweighed
all
other
considerations
would
the
removal
prove
fatal
to
him
by
causing
some
internal
injury
the
reporter
could
not
affirm
it
but
he
and
his
companions
almost
despaired
of
the
result
the
cart
was
brought
to
the
bend
of
the
river
there
some
branches
disposed
as
a
liner
received
the
mattress
on
which
lay
the
unconscious
herbert
ten
minutes
after
cyrus
harding
spilett
and
pencroft
were
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
leaving
neb
to
take
the
cart
on
to
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
the
lift
was
put
in
motion
and
herbert
was
soon
stretched
on
his
bed
in
granite
house
what
cares
were
lavished
on
him
to
bring
him
back
to
life
he
smiled
for
a
moment
on
finding
himself
in
his
room
but
could
scarcely
even
murmur
a
few
words
so
great
was
his
weakness
gideon
spilett
examined
his
wounds
he
feared
to
find
them
reopened
having
been
imperfectly
healed
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
from
whence
then
came
this
prostration
why
was
herbert
so
much
worse
the
lad
then
fell
into
a
kind
of
feverish
sleep
and
the
reporter
and
pencroft
remained
near
the
bed
during
this
time
harding
told
neb
all
that
had
happened
at
the
corral
and
neb
recounted
to
his
master
the
events
of
which
the
plateau
had
just
been
the
theater
it
was
only
during
the
preceding
night
that
the
convicts
had
appeared
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
at
the
approaches
to
creek
glycerine
neb
who
was
watching
near
the
poultryyard
had
not
hesitated
to
fire
at
one
of
the
pirates
who
was
about
to
cross
the
stream
but
in
the
darkness
he
could
not
tell
whether
the
man
had
been
hit
or
not
at
any
rate
it
was
not
enough
to
frighten
away
the
band
and
neb
had
only
just
time
to
get
up
to
granite
house
where
at
least
he
was
in
safety
but
what
was
he
to
do
there
how
prevent
the
devastations
with
which
the
convicts
threatened
the
plateau
had
neb
any
means
by
which
to
warn
his
master
and
besides
in
what
situation
were
the
inhabitants
of
the
corral
themselves
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
had
left
on
the
11th
of
november
and
it
was
now
the
29th
it
was
therefore
nineteen
days
since
neb
had
had
other
news
than
that
brought
by
topdisastrous
news
ayrton
disappeared
herbert
severely
wounded
the
engineer
reporter
and
sailor
as
it
were
imprisoned
in
the
corral
what
was
he
to
do
asked
poor
neb
personally
he
had
nothing
to
fear
for
the
convicts
could
not
reach
him
in
granite
house
but
the
buildings
the
plantations
all
their
arrangements
at
the
mercy
of
the
pirates
would
it
not
be
best
to
let
cyrus
harding
judge
of
what
he
ought
to
do
and
to
warn
him
at
least
of
the
danger
which
threatened
him
neb
then
thought
of
employing
jup
and
confiding
a
note
to
him
he
knew
the
orangs
great
intelligence
which
had
been
often
put
to
the
proof
jup
understood
the
word
corral
which
had
been
frequently
pronounced
before
him
and
it
may
be
remembered
too
that
he
had
often
driven
the
cart
thither
in
company
with
pencroft
day
had
not
yet
dawned
the
active
orang
would
know
how
to
pass
unperceived
through
the
woods
of
which
the
convicts
besides
would
think
he
was
a
native
neb
did
not
hesitate
he
wrote
the
note
he
tied
it
to
jups
neck
he
brought
the
ape
to
the
door
of
granite
house
from
which
he
let
down
a
long
cord
to
the
ground
then
several
times
he
repeated
these
words
jup
jup
corral
corral
the
creature
understood
seized
the
cord
glided
rapidly
down
the
beach
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
without
the
convicts
attention
having
been
in
the
least
excited
you
did
well
neb
said
harding
but
perhaps
in
not
warning
us
you
would
have
done
still
better
and
in
speaking
thus
cyrus
harding
thought
of
herbert
whose
recovery
the
removal
had
so
seriously
checked
neb
ended
his
account
the
convicts
had
not
appeared
at
all
on
the
beach
not
knowing
the
number
of
the
islands
inhabitants
they
might
suppose
that
granite
house
was
defended
by
a
large
party
they
must
have
remembered
that
during
the
attack
by
the
brig
numerous
shot
had
been
fired
both
from
the
lower
and
upper
rocks
and
no
doubt
they
did
not
wish
to
expose
themselves
but
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
was
open
to
them
and
not
covered
by
the
fire
of
granite
house
they
gave
themselves
up
therefore
to
their
instinct
of
destructionplundering
burning
devastating
everythingand
only
retiring
half
an
hour
before
the
arrival
of
the
colonists
whom
they
believed
still
confined
in
the
corral
on
their
retreat
neb
hurried
out
he
climbed
the
plateau
at
the
risk
of
being
perceived
and
fired
at
tried
to
extinguish
the
fire
which
was
consuming
the
buildings
of
the
poultryyard
and
had
struggled
though
in
vain
against
it
until
the
cart
appeared
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
such
had
been
these
serious
events
the
presence
of
the
convicts
constituted
a
permanent
source
of
danger
to
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
until
then
so
happy
and
who
might
now
expect
still
greater
misfortunes
spilett
remained
in
granite
house
with
herbert
and
pencroft
while
cyrus
harding
accompanied
by
neb
proceeded
to
judge
for
himself
of
the
extent
of
the
disaster
it
was
fortunate
that
the
convicts
had
not
advanced
to
the
foot
of
granite
house
the
workshop
at
the
chimneys
would
in
that
case
not
have
escaped
destruction
but
after
all
this
evil
would
have
been
more
easily
reparable
than
the
ruins
accumulated
on
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
harding
and
neb
proceeded
towards
the
mercy
and
ascended
its
left
bank
without
meeting
with
any
trace
of
the
convicts
nor
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
the
depths
of
the
wood
could
they
perceive
any
suspicious
indications
besides
it
might
be
supposed
that
in
all
probability
either
the
convicts
knew
of
the
return
of
the
settlers
to
granite
house
by
having
seen
them
pass
on
the
road
from
the
corral
or
after
the
devastation
of
the
plateau
they
had
penetrated
into
jacamar
wood
following
the
course
of
the
mercy
and
were
thus
ignorant
of
their
return
in
the
former
case
they
must
have
returned
towards
the
corral
now
without
defenders
and
which
contained
valuable
stores
in
the
latter
they
must
have
regained
their
encampment
and
would
wait
on
opportunity
to
recommence
the
attack
it
was
therefore
possible
to
prevent
them
but
any
enterprise
to
clear
the
island
was
now
rendered
difficult
by
reason
of
herberts
condition
indeed
their
whole
force
would
have
been
barely
sufficient
to
cope
with
the
convicts
and
just
now
no
one
could
leave
granite
house
the
engineer
and
neb
arrived
on
the
plateau
desolation
reigned
everywhere
the
fields
had
been
trampled
over
the
ears
of
wheat
which
were
nearly
fullgrown
lay
on
the
ground
the
other
plantations
had
not
suffered
less
the
kitchengarden
was
destroyed
happily
granite
house
possessed
a
store
of
seed
which
would
enable
them
to
repair
these
misfortunes
as
to
the
wall
and
buildings
of
the
poultryyard
and
the
onagers
stable
the
fire
had
destroyed
all
a
few
terrified
creatures
roamed
over
the
plateau
the
birds
which
during
the
fire
had
taken
refuge
on
the
waters
of
the
lake
had
already
returned
to
their
accustomed
spot
and
were
dabbling
on
the
banks
everything
would
have
to
be
reconstructed
cyrus
hardings
face
which
was
paler
than
usual
expressed
an
internal
anger
which
he
commanded
with
difficulty
but
he
did
not
utter
a
word
once
more
he
looked
at
his
devastated
fields
and
at
the
smoke
which
still
rose
from
the
ruins
then
he
returned
to
granite
house
the
following
days
were
the
saddest
of
any
that
the
colonists
had
passed
on
the
island
herberts
weakness
visibly
increased
it
appeared
that
a
more
serious
malady
the
consequence
of
the
profound
physiological
disturbance
he
had
gone
through
threatened
to
declare
itself
and
gideon
spilett
feared
such
an
aggravation
of
his
condition
that
he
would
be
powerless
to
fight
against
it
in
fact
herbert
remained
in
an
almost
continuous
state
of
drowsiness
and
symptoms
of
delirium
began
to
manifest
themselves
refreshing
drinks
were
the
only
remedies
at
the
colonists
disposal
the
fever
was
not
as
yet
very
high
but
it
soon
appeared
that
it
would
probably
recur
at
regular
intervals
gideon
spilett
first
recognized
this
on
the
6th
of
december
the
poor
boy
whose
fingers
nose
and
ears
had
become
extremely
pale
was
at
first
seized
with
slight
shiverings
horripilations
and
tremblings
his
pulse
was
weak
and
irregular
his
skin
dry
his
thirst
intense
to
this
soon
succeeded
a
hot
fit
his
face
became
flushed
his
skin
reddened
his
pulse
quick
then
a
profuse
perspiration
broke
out
after
which
the
fever
seemed
to
diminish
the
attack
had
lasted
nearly
five
hours
gideon
spilett
had
not
left
herbert
who
it
was
only
too
certain
was
now
seized
by
an
intermittent
fever
and
this
fever
must
be
cured
at
any
cost
before
it
should
assume
a
more
serious
aspect
and
in
order
to
cure
it
said
spilett
to
cyrus
harding
we
need
a
febrifuge
a
febrifuge
answered
the
engineer
we
have
neither
peruvian
bark
nor
sulphate
of
quinine
no
said
gideon
spilett
but
there
are
willows
on
the
border
of
the
lake
and
the
bark
of
the
willow
might
perhaps
prove
to
be
a
substitute
for
quinine
let
us
try
it
without
losing
a
moment
replied
cyrus
harding
the
bark
of
the
willow
has
indeed
been
justly
considered
as
a
succedaneum
for
peruvian
bark
as
has
also
that
of
the
horsechestnut
tree
the
leaf
of
the
holly
the
snakeroot
etc
it
was
evidently
necessary
to
make
trial
of
this
substance
although
not
so
valuable
as
peruvian
bark
and
to
employ
it
in
its
natural
state
since
they
had
no
means
for
extracting
its
essence
cyrus
harding
went
himself
to
cut
from
the
trunk
of
a
species
of
black
willow
a
few
pieces
of
bark
he
brought
them
back
to
granite
house
and
reduced
them
to
a
powder
which
was
administered
that
same
evening
to
herbert
the
night
passed
without
any
important
change
herbert
was
somewhat
delirious
but
the
fever
did
not
reappear
in
the
night
and
did
not
return
either
during
the
following
day
pencroft
again
began
to
hope
gideon
spilett
said
nothing
it
might
be
that
the
fever
was
not
quotidian
but
tertian
and
that
it
would
return
next
day
therefore
he
awaited
the
next
day
with
the
greatest
anxiety
it
might
have
been
remarked
besides
that
during
this
period
herbert
remained
utterly
prostrate
his
head
weak
and
giddy
another
symptom
alarmed
the
reporter
to
the
highest
degree
herberts
liver
became
congested
and
soon
a
more
intense
delirium
showed
that
his
brain
was
also
affected
gideon
spilett
was
overwhelmed
by
this
new
complication
he
took
the
engineer
aside
it
is
a
malignant
fever
said
he
a
malignant
fever
cried
harding
you
are
mistaken
spilett
a
malignant
fever
does
not
declare
itself
spontaneously
its
germ
must
previously
have
existed
i
am
not
mistaken
replied
the
reporter
herbert
no
doubt
contracted
the
germ
of
this
fever
in
the
marshes
of
the
island
he
has
already
had
one
attack
should
a
second
come
on
and
should
we
not
be
able
to
prevent
a
third
he
is
lost
but
the
willow
bark
that
is
insufficient
answered
the
reporter
and
the
third
attack
of
a
malignant
fever
which
is
not
arrested
by
means
of
quinine
is
always
fatal
fortunately
pencroft
heard
nothing
of
this
conversation
or
he
would
have
gone
mad
it
may
be
imagined
what
anxiety
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
suffered
during
the
day
of
the
7th
of
december
and
the
following
night
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
the
second
attack
came
on
the
crisis
was
terrible
herbert
felt
himself
sinking
he
stretched
his
arms
towards
cyrus
harding
towards
spilett
towards
pencroft
he
was
so
young
to
die
the
scene
was
heartrending
they
were
obliged
to
send
pencroft
away
the
fit
lasted
five
hours
it
was
evident
that
herbert
could
not
survive
a
third
the
night
was
frightful
in
his
delirium
herbert
uttered
words
which
went
to
the
hearts
of
his
companions
he
struggled
with
the
convicts
he
called
to
ayrton
he
poured
forth
entreaties
to
that
mysterious
beingthat
powerful
unknown
protectorwhose
image
was
stamped
upon
his
mind
then
he
again
fell
into
a
deep
exhaustion
which
completely
prostrated
him
several
times
gideon
spilett
thought
that
the
poor
boy
was
dead
the
next
day
the
8th
of
december
was
but
a
succession
of
the
fainting
fits
herberts
thin
hands
clutched
the
sheets
they
had
administered
further
doses
of
pounded
bark
but
the
reporter
expected
no
result
from
it
if
before
tomorrow
morning
we
have
not
given
him
a
more
energetic
febrifuge
said
the
reporter
herbert
will
be
dead
night
arrivedthe
last
night
it
was
too
much
to
be
feared
of
the
good
brave
intelligent
boy
so
far
in
advance
of
his
years
and
who
was
loved
by
all
as
their
own
child
the
only
remedy
which
existed
against
this
terrible
malignant
fever
the
only
specific
which
could
overcome
it
was
not
to
be
found
in
lincoln
island
during
the
night
of
the
8th
of
december
herbert
was
seized
by
a
more
violent
delirium
his
liver
was
fearfully
congested
his
brain
affected
and
already
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
recognize
any
one
would
he
live
until
the
next
day
until
that
third
attack
which
must
infallibly
carry
him
off
it
was
not
probable
his
strength
was
exhausted
and
in
the
intervals
of
fever
he
lay
as
one
dead
towards
three
oclock
in
the
morning
herbert
uttered
a
piercing
cry
he
seemed
to
be
torn
by
a
supreme
convulsion
neb
who
was
near
him
terrified
ran
into
the
next
room
where
his
companions
were
watching
top
at
that
moment
barked
in
a
strange
manner
all
rushed
in
immediately
and
managed
to
restrain
the
dying
boy
who
was
endeavoring
to
throw
himself
out
of
his
bed
while
spilett
taking
his
arm
felt
his
pulse
gradually
quicken
it
was
five
in
the
morning
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
began
to
shine
in
at
the
windows
of
granite
house
it
promised
to
be
a
fine
day
and
this
day
was
to
be
poor
herberts
last
a
ray
glanced
on
the
table
placed
near
the
bed
suddenly
pencroft
uttering
a
cry
pointed
to
the
table
on
it
lay
a
little
oblong
box
of
which
the
cover
bore
these
wordssulphate
of
quinine
chapter

gideon
spilett
took
the
box
and
opened
it
it
contained
nearly
two
hundred
grains
of
a
white
powder
a
few
particles
of
which
he
carried
to
his
lips
the
extreme
bitterness
of
the
substance
precluded
all
doubt
it
was
certainly
the
precious
extract
of
quinine
that
preeminent
antifebrile
this
powder
must
be
administered
to
herbert
without
delay
how
it
came
there
might
be
discussed
later
some
coffee
said
spilett
in
a
few
moments
neb
brought
a
cup
of
the
warm
infusion
gideon
spilett
threw
into
it
about
eighteen
grains
of
quinine
and
they
succeeded
in
making
herbert
drink
the
mixture
there
was
still
time
for
the
third
attack
of
the
malignant
fever
had
not
yet
shown
itself
how
they
longed
to
be
able
to
add
that
it
would
not
return
besides
it
must
be
remarked
the
hopes
of
all
had
now
revived
the
mysterious
influence
had
been
again
exerted
and
in
a
critical
moment
when
they
had
despaired
of
it
in
a
few
hours
herbert
was
much
calmer
the
colonists
could
now
discuss
this
incident
the
intervention
of
the
stranger
was
more
evident
than
ever
but
how
had
he
been
able
to
penetrate
during
the
night
into
granite
house
it
was
inexplicable
and
in
truth
the
proceedings
of
the
genius
of
the
island
were
not
less
mysterious
than
was
that
genius
himself
during
this
day
the
sulphate
of
quinine
was
administered
to
herbert
every
three
hours
the
next
day
some
improvement
in
herberts
condition
was
apparent
certainly
he
was
not
out
of
danger
intermittent
fevers
being
subject
to
frequent
and
dangerous
relapses
but
the
most
assiduous
care
was
bestowed
on
him
and
besides
the
specific
was
at
hand
nor
doubtless
was
he
who
had
brought
it
far
distant
and
the
hearts
of
all
were
animated
by
returning
hope
this
hope
was
not
disappointed
ten
days
after
on
the
20th
of
december
herberts
convalescence
commenced
he
was
still
weak
and
strict
diet
had
been
imposed
upon
him
but
no
access
of
fever
supervened
and
then
the
poor
boy
submitted
with
such
docility
to
all
the
prescriptions
ordered
him
he
longed
so
to
get
well
pencroft
was
as
a
man
who
has
been
drawn
up
from
the
bottom
of
an
abyss
fits
of
joy
approaching
delirium
seized
him
when
the
time
for
the
third
attack
had
passed
by
he
nearly
suffocated
the
reporter
in
his
embrace
since
then
he
always
called
him
dr
spilett
the
real
doctor
however
remained
undiscovered
we
will
find
him
repeated
the
sailor
certainly
this
man
whoever
he
was
might
expect
a
somewhat
too
energetic
embrace
from
the
worthy
pencroft
the
month
of
december
ended
and
with
it
the
year
1867
during
which
the
colonists
of
lincoln
island
had
of
late
been
so
severely
tried
they
commenced
the
year
1868
with
magnificent
weather
great
heat
and
a
tropical
temperature
delightfully
cooled
by
the
seabreeze
herberts
recovery
progressed
and
from
his
bed
placed
near
one
of
the
windows
of
granite
house
he
could
inhale
the
fresh
air
charged
with
ozone
which
could
not
fail
to
restore
his
health
his
appetite
returned
and
what
numberless
delicate
savory
little
dishes
neb
prepared
for
him
it
is
enough
to
make
one
wish
to
have
a
fever
oneself
said
pencroft
during
all
this
time
the
convicts
did
not
once
appear
in
the
vicinity
of
granite
house
there
was
no
news
of
ayrton
and
though
the
engineer
and
herbert
still
had
some
hopes
of
finding
him
again
their
companions
did
not
doubt
but
that
the
unfortunate
man
had
perished
however
this
uncertainty
could
not
last
and
when
once
the
lad
should
have
recovered
the
expedition
the
result
of
which
must
be
so
important
would
be
undertaken
but
they
would
have
to
wait
a
month
perhaps
for
all
the
strength
of
the
colony
must
be
put
into
requisition
to
obtain
satisfaction
from
the
convicts
however
herberts
convalescence
progressed
rapidly
the
congestion
of
the
liver
had
disappeared
and
his
wounds
might
be
considered
completely
healed
during
the
month
of
january
important
work
was
done
on
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
but
it
consisted
solely
in
saving
as
much
as
was
possible
from
the
devastated
crops
either
of
corn
or
vegetables
the
grain
and
the
plants
were
gathered
so
as
to
provide
a
new
harvest
for
the
approaching
halfseason
with
regard
to
rebuilding
the
poultryyard
wall
or
stables
cyrus
harding
preferred
to
wait
while
he
and
his
companions
were
in
pursuit
of
the
convicts
the
latter
might
very
probably
pay
another
visit
to
the
plateau
and
it
would
be
useless
to
give
them
an
opportunity
of
recommencing
their
work
of
destruction
when
the
island
should
be
cleared
of
these
miscreants
they
would
set
about
rebuilding
the
young
convalescent
began
to
get
up
in
the
second
week
of
january
at

for
one
hour
a
day
then
two
then
three
his
strength
visibly
returned
so
vigorous
was
his
constitution
he
was
now
eighteen
years
of
age
he
was
tall
and
promised
to
become
a
man
of
noble
and
commanding
presence
from
this
time
his
recovery
while
still
requiring
careand
dr
spilett
was
very
strictmade
rapid
progress
towards
the
end
of
the
month
herbert
was
already
walking
about
on
prospect
heights
and
the
beach
he
derived
from
several
seabaths
which
he
took
in
company
with
pencroft
and
neb
the
greatest
possible
benefit
cyrus
harding
thought
he
might
now
settle
the
day
for
their
departure
for
which
the
15th
of
february
was
fixed
the
nights
very
clear
at
this
time
of
year
would
be
favorable
to
the
researches
they
intended
to
make
all
over
the
island
the
necessary
preparations
for
this
exploration
were
now
commenced
and
were
important
for
the
colonists
had
sworn
not
to
return
to
granite
house
until
their
twofold
object
had
been
achieved
on
the
one
hand
to
exterminate
the
convicts
and
rescue
ayrton
if
he
was
still
living
on
the
other
to
discover
who
it
was
that
presided
so
effectually
over
the
fortunes
of
the
colony
of
lincoln
island
the
settlers
knew
thoroughly
all
the
eastern
coast
from
claw
cape
to
the
mandible
capes
the
extensive
tadorn
marsh
the
neighborhood
of
lake
grant
jacamar
wood
between
the
road
to
the
corral
and
the
mercy
the
courses
of
the
mercy
and
red
creek
and
lastly
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
among
which
the
corral
had
been
established
they
had
explored
though
only
in
an
imperfect
manner
the
vast
shore
of
washington
bay
from
claw
cape
to
reptile
end
the
woody
and
marshy
border
of
the
west
coast
and
the
interminable
downs
ending
at
the
open
mouth
of
shark
gulf
but
they
had
in
no
way
surveyed
the
woods
which
covered
the
serpentine
peninsula
all
to
the
right
of
the
mercy
the
left
bank
of
falls
river
and
the
wilderness
of
spurs
and
valleys
which
supported
three
quarters
of
the
base
of
mount
franklin
to
the
east
the
north
and
the
west
and
where
doubtless
many
secret
retreats
existed
consequently
many
millions
of
acres
of
the
island
had
still
escaped
their
investigations
it
was
therefore
decided
that
the
expedition
should
be
carried
through
the
far
west
so
as
to
include
all
that
region
situated
on
the
right
of
the
mercy
it
might
perhaps
be
better
worth
while
to
go
direct
to
the
corral
where
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
convicts
had
again
taken
refuge
either
to
pillage
or
to
establish
themselves
there
but
either
the
devastation
of
the
corral
would
have
been
an
accomplished
fact
by
this
time
and
it
would
be
too
late
to
prevent
it
or
it
had
been
the
convicts
interest
to
entrench
themselves
there
and
there
would
be
still
time
to
go
and
turn
them
out
on
their
return
therefore
after
some
discussion
the
first
plan
was
adhered
to
and
the
settlers
resolved
to
proceed
through
the
wood
to
reptile
end
they
would
make
their
way
with
their
hatchets
and
thus
lay
the
first
draft
of
a
road
which
would
place
granite
house
in
communication
with
the
end
of
the
peninsula
for
a
length
of
from
sixteen
to
seventeen
miles
the
cart
was
in
good
condition
the
onagers
well
rested
could
go
a
long
journey
provisions
camp
effects
a
portable
stove
and
various
utensils
were
packed
in
the
cart
as
also
weapons
and
ammunition
carefully
chosen
from
the
now
complete
arsenal
of
granite
house
but
it
was
necessary
to
remember
that
the
convicts
were
perhaps
roaming
about
the
woods
and
that
in
the
midst
of
these
thick
forests
a
shot
might
quickly
be
fired
and
received
it
was
therefore
resolved
that
the
little
band
of
settlers
should
remain
together
and
not
separate
under
any
pretext
whatever
it
was
also
decided
that
no
one
should
remain
at
granite
house
top
and
jup
themselves
were
to
accompany
the
expedition
the
inaccessible
dwelling
needed
no
guard
the
14th
of
february
eve
of
the
departure
was
consecrated
entirely
to
repose
andthanksgiving
addressed
by
the
colonists
to
the
creator
a
place
in
the
cart
was
reserved
for
herbert
who
though
thoroughly
convalescent
was
still
a
little
weak
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
cyrus
harding
took
the
necessary
measures
to
protect
granite
house
from
any
invasion
the
ladders
which
were
formerly
used
for
the
ascent
were
brought
to
the
chimneys
and
buried
deep
in
the
sand
so
that
they
might
be
available
on
the
return
of
the
colonists
for
the
machinery
of
the
lift
had
been
taken
to
pieces
and
nothing
of
the
apparatus
remained
pencroft
stayed
the
last
in
granite
house
in
order
to
finish
this
work
and
he
then
lowered
himself
down
by
means
of
a
double
rope
held
below
and
which
when
once
hauled
down
left
no
communication
between
the
upper
landing
and
the
beach
the
weather
was
magnificent
we
shall
have
a
warm
day
of
it
said
the
reporter
laughing
pooh
dr
spilett
answered
pencroft
we
shall
walk
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
shant
even
see
the
sun
forward
said
the
engineer
the
cart
was
waiting
on
the
beach
before
the
chimneys
the
reporter
made
herbert
take
his
place
in
it
during
the
first
hours
at
least
of
the
journey
and
the
lad
was
obliged
to
submit
to
his
doctors
orders
neb
placed
himself
at
the
onagers
heads
cyrus
harding
the
reporter
and
the
sailor
walked
in
front
top
bounded
joyfully
along
herbert
offered
a
seat
in
his
vehicle
to
jup
who
accepted
it
without
ceremony
the
moment
for
departure
had
arrived
and
the
little
band
set
out
the
cart
first
turned
the
angle
of
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
then
having
ascended
the
left
bank
for
a
mile
crossed
the
bridge
at
the
other
side
of
which
commenced
the
road
to
port
balloon
and
there
the
explorers
leaving
this
road
on
their
left
entered
the
cover
of
the
immense
woods
which
formed
the
region
of
the
far
west
for
the
first
two
miles
the
widely
scattered
trees
allowed
the
cart
to

with
ease
from
time
to
time
it
became
necessary
to
cut
away
a
few
creepers
and
bushes
but
no
serious
obstacle
impeded
the
progress
of
the
colonists
the
thick
foliage
of
the
trees
threw
a
grateful
shade
on
the

and

as

and
paroquets
agouties
kangaroos
and
capybaras
fled
swiftly
at
their
approach
and
all
this
reminded
the
settlers
of
the
first
excursions
they
had
made
on
their
arrival
at
the
island
nevertheless
observed
cyrus
harding
i
notice
that
these
creatures
both
birds
and
quadrupeds
are
more
timid
than
formerly
these
woods
have
therefore
been
recently
traversed
by
the
convicts
and
we
shall
certainly
find
some
traces
of
them
and
in
fact
in
several
places
they
could
distinguish
traces
more
or
less
recent
of
the
passage
of
a
band
of
menhere
branches
broken
off
the
trees
perhaps
to
mark
out
the
way
there
the
ashes
of
a
fire
and
footprints
in
clayey
spots
but
nothing
which
appeared
to
belong
to
a
settled
encampment
the
engineer
had
recommended
his
companions
to
refrain
from
hunting
the
reports
of
the
firearms
might
give
the
alarm
to
the
convicts
who
were
perhaps
roaming
through
the
forest
moreover
the
hunters
would
necessarily
ramble
some
distance
from
the
cart
which
it
was
dangerous
to
leave
unguarded
in
the
afterpart
of
the
day
when
about
six
miles
from
granite
house
their
progress
became
much
more
difficult
in
order
to
make
their
way
through
some
thickets
they
were
obliged
to
cut
down
trees
before
entering
such
places
harding
was
careful
to
send
in
top
and
jup
who
faithfully
accomplished
their
commission
and
when
the
dog
and
orang
returned
without
giving
any
warning
there
was
evidently
nothing
to
fear
either
from
convicts
or
wild
beasts
two
varieties
of
the
animal
kingdom
whose
ferocious
instincts
placed
them
on
the
same
level
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
the
colonists
encamped
about
nine
miles
from
granite
house
on
the
border
of
a
little
stream
falling
into
the
mercy
and
of
the
existence
of
which
they
had
till
then
been
ignorant
it
evidently
however
belonged
to
the
hydiographical
system
to
which
the
soil
owed
its
astonishing
fertility
the
settlers
made
a
hearty
meal
for
their
appetites
were
sharpened
and
measures
were
then
taken
that
the
night
might
be
passed
in
safety
if
the
engineer
had
had
only
to
deal
with
wild
beasts
jaguars
or
others
he
would
have
simply
lighted
fires
all
around
his
camp
which
would
have
sufficed
for
its
defense
but
the
convicts
would
be
rather
attracted
than
terrified
by
the
flames
and
it
was
therefore
better
to
be
surrounded
by
the
profound
darkness
of
night
the
watch
was
however
carefully
organized
two
of
the
settlers
were
to
watch
together
and
every
two
hours
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
be
relieved
by
their
comrades
and
so
notwithstanding
his
wish
to
the
contrary
herbert
was
exempted
from
guard
pencroft
and
gideon
spilett
in
one
party
the
engineer
and
neb
in
another
mounted
guard
in
turns
over
the
camp
the
night
however
was
but
of
few
hours
the
darkness
was
due
rather
to
the
thickness
of
the
foliage
than
to
the
disappearance
of
the
sun
the
silence
was
scarcely
disturbed
by
the
howling
of
jaguars
and
the
chattering
of
the
monkeys
the
latter
appearing
to
particularly
irritate
master
jup
the
night
passed
without
incident
and
on
the
next
day
the
15th
of
february
the
journey
through
the
forest
tedious
rather
than
difficult
was
continued
this
day
they
could
not
accomplish
more
than
six
miles
for
every
moment
they
were
obliged
to
cut
a
road
with
their
hatchets
like
true
settlers
the
colonists
spared
the
largest
and
most
beautiful
trees
which
would
besides
have
cost
immense
labor
to
fell
and
the
small
ones
only
were
sacrificed
but
the
result
was
that
the
road
took
a
very
winding
direction
and
lengthened
itself
by
numerous
detours
during
the
day
herbert
discovered
several
new
specimens
not
before
met
with
in
the
island
such
as
the
treefern
with
its
leaves
spread
out
like
the
waters
of
a
fountain
locusttrees
on
the
long
pods
of
which
the
onagers
browsed
greedily
and
which
supplied
a
sweet
pulp
of
excellent
flavor
there
too
the
colonists
again
found
groups
of
magnificent
kauries
their
cylindrical
trunks
crowded
with
a
cone
of
verdure
rising
to
a
height
of
two
hundred
feet
these
were
the
treekings
of
new
zealand
as
celebrated
as
the
cedars
of
lebanon
as
to
the
fauna
there
was
no
addition
to
those
species
already
known
to
the
hunters
nevertheless
they
saw
though
unable
to
get
near
them
a
couple
of
those
large
birds
peculiar
to
australia
a
sort
of
cassowary
called
emu
five
feet
in
height
and
with
brown
plumage
which
belong
to
the
tribe
of
waders
top
darted
after
them
as
fast
as
his
four
legs
could
carry
him
but
the
emus
distanced
him
with
ease
so
prodigious
was
their
speed
as
to
the
traces
left
by
the
convicts
a
few
more
were
discovered
some
footprints
found
near
an
apparently
recently
extinguished
fire
were
attentively
examined
by
the
settlers
by
measuring
them
one
after
the
other
according
to
their
length
and
breadth
the
marks
of
five
mens
feet
were
easily
distinguished
the
five
convicts
had
evidently
camped
on
this
spot
butand
this
was
the
object
of
so
minute
an
examinationa
sixth
footprint
could
not
be
discovered
which
in
that
case
would
have
been
that
of
ayrton
ayrton
was
not
with
them
said
herbert
no
answered
pencroft
and
if
he
was
not
with
them
it
was
because
the
wretches
had
already
murdered
him
but
then
these
rascals
have
not
a
den
to
which
they
may
be
tracked
like
tigers
no
replied
the
reporter
it
is
more
probable
that
they
wander
at
random
and
it
is
their
interest
to
rove
about
until
the
time
when
they
will
be
masters
of
the
island
the
masters
of
the
island
exclaimed
the
sailor
the
masters
of
the
island
he
repeated
and
his
voice
was
choked
as
if
his
throat
was
seized
in
an
iron
grasp
then
in
a
calmer
tone
do
you
know
captain
harding
said
he
what
the
ball
is
which
i
have
rammed
into
my
gun
no
pencroft
it
is
the
ball
that
went
through
herberts
chest
and
i
promise
you
it
wont
miss
its
mark
but
this
just
retaliation
would
not
bring
ayrton
back
to
life
and
from
the
examination
of
the
footprints
left
in
the
ground
they
must
alas
conclude
that
all
hopes
of
ever
seeing
him
again
must
be
abandoned
that
evening
they
encamped
fourteen
miles
from
granite
house
and
cyrus
harding
calculated
that
they
could
not
be
more
than
five
miles
from
reptile
point
and
indeed
the
next
day
the
extremity
of
the
peninsula
was
reached
and
the
whole
length
of
the
forest
had
been
traversed
but
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
the
retreat
in
which
the
convicts
had
taken
refuge
nor
that
no
less
secret
which
sheltered
the
mysterious
unknown
chapter
12
the
next
day
the
18th
of
february
was
devoted
to
the
exploration
of
all
that
wooded
region
forming
the
shore
from
reptile
end
to
falls
river
the
colonists
were
able
to
search
this
forest
thoroughly
for
as
it
was
comprised
between
the
two
shores
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
it
was
only
from
three
to
four
miles
in
breadth
the
trees
both
by
their
height
and
their
thick
foliage
bore
witness
to
the
vegetative
power
of
the
soil
more
astonishing
here
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
island
one
might
have
said
that
a
corner
from
the
virgin
forests
of
america
or
africa
had
been
transported
into
this
temperate
zone
this
led
them
to
conclude
that
the
superb
vegetation
found
a
heat
in
this
soil
damp
in
its
upper
layer
but
warmed
in
the
interior
by
volcanic
fires
which
could
not
belong
to
a
temperate
climate
the
most
frequently
occurring
trees
were
knaries
and
eucalypti
of
gigantic
dimensions
but
the
colonists
object
was
not
simply
to
admire
the
magnificent
vegetation
they
knew
already
that
in
this
respect
lincoln
island
would
have
been
worthy
to
take
the
first
rank
in
the
canary
group
to
which
the
first
name
given
was
that
of
the
happy
isles
now
alas
their
island
no
longer
belonged
to
them
entirely
others
had
taken
possession
of
it
miscreants
polluted
its
shores
and
they
must
be
destroyed
to
the
last
man
no
traces
were
found
on
the
western
coast
although
they
were
carefully
sought
for
no
more
footprints
no
more
broken
branches
no
more
deserted
camps
this
does
not
surprise
me
said
cyrus
harding
to
his
companions
the
convicts
first
landed
on
the
island
in
the
neighborhood
of
flotsam
point
and
they
immediately
plunged
into
the
far
west
forests
after
crossing
tadorn
marsh
they
then
followed
almost
the
same
route
that
we
took
on
leaving
granite
house
this
explains
the
traces
we
found
in
the
wood
but
arriving
on
the
shore
the
convicts
saw
at
once
that
they
would
discover
no
suitable
retreat
there
and
it
was
then
that
going
northwards
again
they
came
upon
the
corral
where
they
have
perhaps
returned
said
pencroft
i
do
not
think
so
answered
the
engineer
for
they
would
naturally
suppose
that
our
researches
would
be
in
that
direction
the
corral
is
only
a
storehouse
to
them
and
not
a
definitive
encampment
i
am
of
cyrus
opinion
said
the
reporter
and
i
think
that
it
is
among
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
that
the
convicts
will
have
made
their
lair
then
captain
straight
to
the
corral
cried
pencroft
we
must
finish
them
off
and
till
now
we
have
only
lost
time
no
my
friend
replied
the
engineer
you
forget
that
we
have
a
reason
for
wishing
to
know
if
the
forests
of
the
far
west
do
not
contain
some
habitation
our
exploration
has
a
double
object
pencroft
if
on
the
one
hand
we
have
to
chastise
crime
we
have
on
the
other
an
act
of
gratitude
to
perform
that
was
well
said
captain
replied
the
sailor
but
all
the
same
it
is
my
opinion
that
we
shall
not
find
the
gentleman
until
he
pleases
and
truly
pencroft
only
expressed
the
opinion
of
all
it
was
probable
that
the
strangers
retreat
was
not
less
mysterious
than
was
he
himself
that
evening
the
cart
halted
at
the
mouth
of
falls
river
the
camp
was
organized
as
usual
and
the
customary
precautions
were
taken
for
the
night
herbert
become
again
the
healthy
and
vigorous
lad
he
was
before
his
illness
derived
great
benefit
from
this
life
in
the
open
air
between
the
sea
breezes
and
the
vivifying
air
from
the
forests
his
place
was
no
longer
in
the
cart
but
at
the
head
of
the
troop
the
next
day
the
19th
of
february
the
colonists
leaving
the
shore
where
beyond
the
mouth
basalts
of
every
shape
were
so
picturesquely
piled
up
ascended
the
river
by
its
left
bank
the
road
had
been
already
partly
cleared
in
their
former
excursions
made
from
the
corral
to
the
west
coast
the
settlers
were
now
about
six
miles
from
mount
franklin
the
engineers
plan
was
thisto
minutely
survey
the
valley
forming
the
bed
of
the
river
and
to
cautiously
approach
the
neighborhood
of
the
corral
if
the
corral
was
occupied
to
seize
it
by
force
if
it
was
not
to
entrench
themselves
there
and
make
it
the
center
of
the
operations
which
had
for
their
object
the
exploration
of
mount
franklin
this
plan
was
unanimously
approved
by
the
colonists
for
they
were
impatient
to
regain
entire
possession
of
their
island
they
made
their
way
then
along
the
narrow
valley
separating
two
of
the
largest
spurs
of
mount
franklin
the
trees
crowded
on
the
rivers
bank
became
rare
on
the
upper
slopes
of
the
mountain
the
ground
was
hilly
and
rough
very
suitable
for
ambushes
and
over
which
they
did
not
venture
without
extreme
precaution

and

on
the
flanks
springing
right
and
left
through
the
thick
brushwood
and
emulating
each
other
in
intelligence
and
activity
but
nothing
showed
that
the
banks
of
the
stream
had
been
recently
frequentednothing
announced
either
the
presence
or
the
proximity
of
the
convicts
towards
five
in
the
evening
the
cart
stopped
nearly
600
feet
from
the
palisade
a
semicircular
screen
of
trees
still
hid
it
it
was
necessary
to
reconnoiter
the
corral
in
order
to
ascertain
if
it
was
occupied
to
go
there
openly
in
broad
daylight
when
the
convicts
were
probably
in
ambush
would
be
to
expose
themselves
as
poor
herbert
had
done
to
the
firearms
of
the
ruffians
it
was
better
then
to
wait
until
night
came
on
however
gideon
spilett
wished
without
further
delay
to
reconnoiter
the
approaches
to
the
corral
and
pencroft
who
was
quite
out
of
patience
volunteered
to
accompany
him
no
my
friends
said
the
engineer
wait
till
night
i
will
not
allow
one
of
you
to
expose
himself
in
open
day
but
captain
answered
the
sailor
little
disposed
to
obey
i
beg
of
you
pencroft
said
the
engineer
very
well
replied
the
sailor
who
vented
his
anger
in
another
way
by
bestowing
on
the
convicts
the
worst
names
in
his
maritime
vocabulary
the
colonists
remained
therefore
near
the
cart
and
carefully
watched
the
neighboring
parts
of
the
forest
three
hours
passed
thus
the
wind
had
fallen
and
absolute
silence
reigned
under
the
great
trees
the
snapping
of
the
smallest
twig
a
footstep
on
the
dry
leaves
the
gliding
of
a
body
among
the
grass
would
have
been
heard
without
difficulty
all
was
quiet
besides
top
lying
on
the
grass
his
head
stretched
out
on
his
paws
gave
no
sign
of
uneasiness
at
eight
oclock
the
day
appeared
far
enough
advanced
for
the
reconnaissance
to
be
made
under
favorable
conditions
gideon
spilett
declared
himself
ready
to
set
out
accompanied
by
pencroft
cyrus
harding
consented
top
and
jup
were
to
remain
with
the
engineer
herbert
and
neb
for
a
bark
or
a
cry
at
a
wrong
moment
would
give
the
alarm
do
not
be
imprudent
said
harding
to
the
reporter
and
pencroft
you
have
not
to
gain
possession
of
the
corral
but
only
to
find
out
whether
it
is
occupied
or
not
all
right
answered
pencroft
and
the
two
departed
under
the
trees
thanks
to
the
thickness
of
their
foliage
the
obscurity
rendered
any
object
invisible
beyond
a
radius
of
from
thirty
to
forty
feet
the
reporter
and
pencroft
halting
at
any
suspicious
sound
advanced
with
great
caution
they
walked
a
little
distance
apart
from
each
other
so
as
to
offer
a
less
mark
for
a
shot
and
to
tell
the
truth
they
expected
every
moment
to
hear
a
report
five
minutes
after
leaving
the
cart
gideon
spilett
and
pencroft
arrived
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
before
the
clearing
beyond
which
rose
the
palisade
they
stopped
a
few
straggling
beams
still
fell
on
the
field
clear
of
trees
thirty
feet
distant
was
the
gate
of
the
corral
which
appeared
to
be
closed
this
thirty
feet
which
it
was
necessary
to
cross
from
the
wood
to
the
palisade
constituted
the
dangerous
zone
to
borrow
a
ballistic
term
in
fact
one
or
more
bullets
fired
from
behind
the
palisade
might
knock
over
any
one
who
ventured
on
to
this
zone
gideon
spilett
and
the
sailor
were
not
men
to
draw
back
but
they
knew
that
any
imprudence
on
their
part
of
which
they
would
be
the
first
victims
would
fall
afterwards
on
their
companions
if
they
themselves
were
killed
what
would
become
of
harding
neb
and
herbert
but
pencroft
excited
at
feeling
himself
so
near
the
corral
where
he
supposed
the
convicts
had
taken
refuge
was
about
to
press
forward
when
the
reporter
held
him
back
with
a
grasp
of
iron
in
a
few
minutes
it
will
be
quite
dark
whispered
spilett
in
the
sailors
ear
then
will
be
the
time
to
act
pencroft
convulsively
clasping
the
buttend
of
his
gun
restrained
his
energies
and
waited
swearing
to
himself
soon
the
last
of
the
twilight
faded
away
darkness
which
seemed
as
if
it
issued
from
the
dense
forest
covered
the
clearing
mount
franklin
rose
like
an
enormous
screen
before
the
western
horizon
and
night
spread
rapidly
over
all
as
it
does
in
regions
of
low
latitudes
now
was
the
time
the
reporter
and
pencroft
since
posting
themselves
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
had
not
once
lost
sight
of
the
palisade
the
corral
appeared
to
be
absolutely
deserted
the
top
of
the
palisade
formed
a
line
a
little
darker
than
the
surrounding
shadow
and
nothing
disturbed
its
distinctness
nevertheless
if
the
convicts
were
there
they
must
have
posted
one
of
their
number
to
guard
against
any
surprise
spilett
grasped
his
companions
hand
and
both
crept
towards
the
corral
their
guns
ready
to
fire
they
reached
the
gate
without
the
darkness
being
illuminated
by
a
single
ray
of
light
pencroft
tried
to
push
open
the
gate
which
as
the
reporter
and
he
had
supposed
was
closed
however
the
sailor
was
able
to
ascertain
that
the
outer
bars
had
not
been
put
up
it
might
then
be
concluded
that
the
convicts
were
there
in
the
corral
and
that
very
probably
they
had
fastened
the
gate
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
not
be
forced
open
gideon
spilett
and
pencroft
listened
not
a
sound
could
be
heard
inside
the
palisade
the
musmons
and
the
goats
sleeping
no
doubt
in
their
huts
in
no
way
disturbed
the
calm
of
night
the
reporter
and
the
sailor
hearing
nothing
asked
themselves
whether
they
had
not
better
scale
the
palisades
and
penetrate
into
the
corral
this
would
have
been
contrary
to
cyrus
hardings
instructions
it
is
true
that
the
enterprise
might
succeed
but
it
might
also
fail
now
if
the
convicts
were
suspecting
nothing
if
they
knew
nothing
of
the
expedition
against
them
if
lastly
there
now
existed
a
chance
of
surprising
them
ought
this
chance
to
be
lost
by
inconsiderately
attempting
to
cross
the
palisades
this
was
not
the
reporters
opinion
he
thought
it
better
to
wait
until
all
the
settlers
were
collected
together
before
attempting
to
penetrate
into
the
corral
one
thing
was
certain
that
it
was
possible
to
reach
the
palisade
without
being
seen
and
also
that
it
did
not
appear
to
be
guarded
this
point
settled
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
return
to
the
cart
where
they
would
consult
pencroft
probably
agreed
with
this
decision
for
he
followed
the
reporter
without
making
any
objection
when
the
latter
turned
back
to
the
wood
in
a
few
minutes
the
engineer
was
made
acquainted
with
the
state
of
affairs
well
said
he
after
a
little
thought
i
now
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
convicts
are
not
in
the
corral
we
shall
soon
know
said
pencroft
when
we
have
scaled
the
palisade
to
the
corral
my
friends
said
cyrus
harding
shall
we
leave
the
cart
in
the
wood
asked
neb
no
replied
the
engineer
it
is
our
wagon
of
ammunition
and
provisions
and
if
necessary
it
would
serve
as
an
entrenchment
forward
then
said
gideon
spilett
the
cart
emerged
from
the
wood
and
began
to
roll
noiselessly
towards
the
palisade
the
darkness
was
now
profound
the
silence
as
complete
as
when
pencroft
and
the
reporter
crept
over
the
ground
the
thick
grass
completely
muffled
their
footsteps
the
colonists
held
themselves
ready
to
fire
jup
at
pencrofts
orders
kept
behind
neb
led
top
in
a
leash
to
prevent
him
from
bounding
forward
the
clearing
soon
came
in
sight
it
was
deserted
without
hesitating
the
little
band
moved
towards
the
palisade
in
a
short
space
of
time
the
dangerous
zone
was
passed
neb
remained
at
the
onagers
heads
to
hold
them
the
engineer
the
reporter
herbert
and
pencroft
proceeded
to
the
door
in
order
to
ascertain
if
it
was
barricaded
inside
it
was
open
what
do
you
say
now
asked
the
engineer
turning
to
the
sailor
and
spilett
both
were
stupefied
i
can
swear
said
pencroft
that
this
gate
was
shut
just
now
the
colonists
now
hesitated
were
the
convicts
in
the
corral
when
pencroft
and
the
reporter
made
their
reconnaissance
it
could
not
be
doubted
as
the
gate
then
closed
could
only
have
been
opened
by
them
were
they
still
there
or
had
one
of
their
number
just
gone
out
all
these
questions
presented
themselves
simultaneously
to
the
minds
of
the
colonists
but
how
could
they
be
answered
at
that
moment
herbert
who
had
advanced
a
few
steps
into
the
enclosure
drew
back
hurriedly
and
seized
hardings
hand
whats
the
matter
asked
the
engineer
a
light
in
the
house
yes
all
five
advanced
and
indeed
through
the
window
fronting
them
they
saw
glimmering
a
feeble
light
cyrus
harding
made
up
his
mind
rapidly
it
is
our
only
chance
said
he
to
his
companions
of
finding
the
convicts
collected
in
this
house
suspecting
nothing
they
are
in
our
power
forward
the
colonists
crossed
through
the
enclosure
holding
their
guns
ready
in
their
hands
the
cart
had
been
left
outside
under
the
charge
of
jup
and
top
who
had
been
prudently
tied
to
it
cyrus
harding
pencroft
and
gideon
spilett
on
one
side
herbert
and
neb
on
the
other
going
along
by
the
palisade
surveyed
the
absolutely
dark
and
deserted
corral
in
a
few
moments
they
were
near
the
closed
door
of
the
house
harding
signed
to
his
companions
not
to
stir
and
approached
the
window
then
feebly
lighted
by
the
inner
light
he
gazed
into
the
apartment
on
the
table
burned
a
lantern
near
the
table
was
the
bed
formerly
used
by
ayrton
on
the
bed
lay
the
body
of
a
man
suddenly
cyrus
harding
drew
back
and
in
a
hoarse
voiceayrton
he
exclaimed
immediately
the
door
was
forced
rather
than
opened
and
the
colonists
rushed
into
the
room
ayrton
appeared
to
be
asleep
his
countenance
showed
that
he
had
long
and
cruelly
suffered
on
his
wrists
and
ankles
could
be
seen
great
bruises
harding
bent
over
him
ayrton
cried
the
engineer
seizing
the
arm
of
the
man
whom
he
had
just
found
again
under
such
unexpected
circumstances
at
this
exclamation
ayrton
opened
his
eyes
and
gazing
at
harding
then
at
the
others
you
he
cried
you
ayrton
ayrton
repeated
harding
where
am
i
in
the
house
in
the
corral
alone
yes
but
they
will
come
back
cried
ayrton
defend
yourselves
defend
yourselves
and
he
fell
back
exhausted
spilett
exclaimed
the
engineer
we
may
be
attacked
at
any
moment
bring
the
cart
into
the
corral
then
barricade
the
door
and
all
come
back
here
pencroft
neb
and
the
reporter
hastened
to
execute
the
engineers
orders
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
perhaps
even
now
the
cart
was
in
the
hands
of
the
convicts
in
a
moment
the
reporter
and
his
two
companions
had
crossed
the
corral
and
reached
the
gate
of
the
palisade
behind
which
top
was
heard
growling
sullenly
the
engineer
leaving
ayrton
for
an
instant
came
out
ready
to
fire
herbert
was
at
his
side
both
surveyed
the
crest
of
the
spur
overlooking
the
corral
if
the
convicts
were
lying
in
ambush
there
they
might
knock
the
settlers
over
one
after
the
other
at
that
moment
the
moon
appeared
in
the
east
above
the
black
curtain
of
the
forest
and
a
white
sheet
of
light
spread
over
the
interior
of
the
enclosure
the
corral
with
its
clumps
of
trees
the
little
stream
which
watered
it
its
wide
carpet
of
grass
was
suddenly
illuminated
from
the
side
of
the
mountain
the
house
and
a
part
of
the
palisade
stood
out
white
in
the
moonlight
on
the
opposite
side
towards
the
door
the
enclosure
remained
dark
a
black
mass
soon
appeared
this
was
the
cart
entering
the
circle
of
light
and
cyrus
harding
could
hear
the
noise
made
by
the
door
as
his
companions
shut
it
and
fastened
the
interior
bars
but
at
that
moment
top
breaking
loose
began
to
bark
furiously
and
rush
to
the
back
of
the
corral
to

cried
harding
the
colonists
raised
their
pieces
and
waited
the
moment
to
fire
top
still
barked
and
jup
running
towards
the
dog
uttered
shrill
cries
the
colonists
followed
him
and
reached
the
borders
of
the
little
stream
shaded
by
large
trees
and
there
in
the
bright
moonlight
what
did
they
see
five
corpses
stretched
on
the
bank
they
were
those
of
the
convicts
who
four
months
previously
had
landed
on

island
chapter
13
how
had
it
happened
who
had
killed
the
convicts
was
it
ayrton
no
for
a
moment
before
he
was
dreading
their
return
but
ayrton
was
now
in
a
profound
stupor
from
which
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
rouse
him
after
uttering
those
few
words
he
had
again
become
unconscious
and
had
fallen
back
motionless
on
the
bed
the
colonists
a
prey
to
a
thousand
confused
thoughts
under
the
influence
of
violent
excitement
waited
all
night
without
leaving
ayrtons
house
or
returning
to
the
spot
where
lay
the
bodies
of
the
convicts
it
was
very
probable
that
ayrton
would
not
be
able
to
throw
any
light
on
the
circumstances
under
which
the
bodies
had
been
found
since
he
himself
was
not
aware
that
he
was
in
the
corral
but
at
any
rate
he
would
be
in
a
position
to
give
an
account
of
what
had
taken
place
before
this
terrible
execution
the
next
day
ayrton
awoke
from
his
torpor
and
his
companions
cordially
manifested
all
the
joy
they
felt
on
seeing
him
again
almost
safe
and
sound
after
a
hundred
and
four
days
separation
ayrton
then
in
a
few
words
recounted
what
had
happened
or
at
least
as
much
as
he
knew
the
day
after
his
arrival
at
the
corral
on
the
10th
of
last
november
at
nightfall
he
was
surprised
by
the
convicts
who
had
scaled
the
palisade
they
bound
and
gagged
him
then
he
was
led
to
a
dark
cavern
at
the
foot
of
mount
franklin
where
the
convicts
had
taken
refuge
his
death
had
been
decided
upon
and
the
next
day
the
convicts
were
about
to
kill
him
when
one
of
them
recognized
him
and
called
him
by
the
name
which
he
bore
in
australia
the
wretches
had
no
scruples
as
to
murdering
ayrton
they
spared
ben
joyce
but
from
that
moment
ayrton
was
exposed
to
the
importunities
of
his
former
accomplices
they
wished
him
to
join
them
again
and
relied
upon
his
aid
to
enable
them
to
gain
possession
of
granite
house
to
penetrate
into
that
hitherto
inaccessible
dwelling
and
to
become
masters
of
the
island
after
murdering
the
colonists
ayrton
remained
firm
the
once
convict
now
repentant
and
pardoned
would
rather
die
than
betray
his
companions
ayrtonbound
gagged
and
closely
watchedlived
in
this
cave
for
four
months
nevertheless
the
convicts
had
discovered
the
corral
a
short
time
after
their
arrival
in
the
island
and
since
then
they
had
subsisted
on
ayrtons
stores
but
did
not
live
at
the
corral
on
the
11th
of
november
two
of
the
villains
surprised
by
the
colonists
arrival
fired
at
herbert
and
one
of
them
returned
boasting
of
having
killed
one
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
but
he
returned
alone
his
companion
as
is
known
fell
by
cyrus
hardings
dagger
ayrtons
anxiety
and
despair
may
be
imagined
when
he
learned
the
news
of
herberts
death
the
settlers
were
now
only
four
and
as
it
seemed
at
the
mercy
of
the
convicts
after
this
event
and
during
all
the
time
that
the
colonists
detained
by
herberts
illness
remained
in
the
corral
the
pirates
did
not
leave
their
cavern
and
even
after
they
had
pillaged
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
they
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
abandon
it
the
illtreatment
inflicted
on
ayrton
was
now
redoubled
his
hands
and
feet
still
bore
the
bloody
marks
of
the
cords
which
bound
him
day
and
night
every
moment
he
expected
to
be
put
to
death
nor
did
it
appear
possible
that
he
could
escape
matters
remained
thus
until
the
third
week
of
february
the
convicts
still
watching
for
a
favorable
opportunity
rarely
quitted
their
retreat
and
only
made
a
few
hunting
excursions
either
to
the
interior
of
the
island
or
the
south
coast
ayrton
had
no
further
news
of
his
friends
and
relinquished
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
them
again
at
last
the
unfortunate
man
weakened
by
illtreatment
fell
into
a
prostration
so
profound
that
sight
and
hearing
failed
him
from
that
moment
that
is
to
say
since
the
last
two
days
he
could
give
no
information
whatever
of
what
had
occurred
but
captain
harding
he
added
since
i
was
imprisoned
in
that
cavern
how
is
it
that
i
find
myself
in
the
corral
how
is
it
that
the
convicts
are
lying
yonder
dead
in
the
middle
of
the
enclosure
answered
the
engineer
dead
cried
ayrton
half
rising
from
his
bed
notwithstanding
his
weakness
his
companions
supported
him
he
wished
to
get
up
and
with
their
assistance
he
did
so
they
then
proceeded
together
towards
the
little
stream
it
was
now
broad
daylight
there
on
the
bank
in
the
position
in
which
they
had
been
stricken
by
death
in
its
most
instantaneous
form
lay
the
corpses
of
the
five
convicts
ayrton
was
astounded
harding
and
his
companions
looked
at
him
without
uttering
a
word
on
a
sign
from
the
engineer
neb
and
pencroft
examined
the
bodies
already
stiffened
by
the
cold
they
bore
no
apparent
trace
of
any
wound
only
after
carefully
examining
them
pencroft
found
on
the
forehead
of
one
on
the
chest
of
another
on
the
back
of
this
one
on
the
shoulder
of
that
a
little
red
spot
a
sort
of
scarcely
visible
bruise
the
cause
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
conjecture
it
is
there
that
they
have
been
struck
said
cyrus
harding
but
with
what
weapon
cried
the
reporter
a
weapon
lightninglike
in
its
effects
and
of
which
we
have
not
the
secret
and
who
has
struck
the
blow
asked
pencroft
the
avenging
power
of
the
island
replied
harding
he
who
brought
you
here
ayrton
whose
influence
has
once
more
manifested
itself
who
does
for
us
all
that
which
we
cannot
do
for
ourselves
and
who
his
will
accomplished
conceals
himself
from
us
let
us
make
search
for
him
then
exclaimed
pencroft
yes
we
will
search
for
him
answered
harding
but
we
shall
not
discover
this
powerful
being
who
performs
such
wonders
until
he
pleases
to
call
us
to
him
this
invisible
protection
which
rendered
their
own
action
unavailing
both
irritated
and
piqued
the
engineer
the
relative
inferiority
which
it
proved
was
of
a
nature
to
wound
a
haughty
spirit
a
generosity
evinced
in
such
a
manner
as
to
elude
all
tokens
of
gratitude
implied
a
sort
of
disdain
for
those
on
whom
the
obligation
was
conferred
which
in
cyrus
hardings
eyes
marred
in
some
degree
the
worth
of
the
benefit
let
us
search
he
resumed
and
god
grant
that
we
may
some
day
be
permitted
to
prove
to
this
haughty
protector
that
he
has
not
to
deal
with
ungrateful
people
what
would
i
not
give
could
we
repay
him
by
rendering
him
in
our
turn
although
at
the
price
of
our
lives
some
signal
service
from
this
day
the
thoughts
of
the
inhabitants
of
lincoln
island
were
solely
occupied
with
the
intended
search
everything
incited
them
to
discover
the
answer
to
this
enigma
an
answer
which
would
only
be
the
name
of
a
man
endowed
with
a
truly
inexplicable
and
in
some
degree
superhuman
power
in
a
few
minutes
the
settlers
reentered
the
house
where
their
influence
soon
restored
to
ayrton
his
moral
and
physical
energy
neb
and
pencroft
carried
the
corpses
of
the
convicts
into
the
forest
some
distance
from
the
corral
and
buried
them
deep
in
the
ground
ayrton
was
then
made
acquainted
with
the
facts
which
had
occurred
during
his
seclusion
he
learned
herberts
adventures
and
through
what
various
trials
the
colonists
had
passed
as
to
the
settlers
they
had
despaired
of
ever
seeing
ayrton
again
and
had
been
convinced
that
the
convicts
had
ruthlessly
murdered
him
and
now
said
cyrus
harding
as
he
ended
his
recital
a
duty
remains
for
us
to
perform
half
of
our
task
is
accomplished
but
although
the
convicts
are
no
longer
to
be
feared
it
is
not
owing
to
ourselves
that
we
are
once
more
masters
of
the
island
well
answered
gideon
spilett
let
us
search
all
this
labyrinth
of
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
we
will
not
leave
a
hollow
not
a
hole
unexplored
ah
if
ever
a
reporter
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
mystery
it
is
i
who
now
speak
to
you
my
friends
and
we
will
not
return
to
granite
house
until
we
have
found
our
benefactor
said
herbert
yes
said
the
engineer
we
will
do
all
that
it
is
humanly
possible
to
do
but
i
repeat
we
shall
not
find
him
until
he
himself
permits
us
shall
we
stay
at
the
corral
asked
pencroft
we
shall
stay
here
answered
harding
provisions
are
abundant
and
we
are
here
in
the
very
center
of
the
circle
we
have
to
explore
besides
if
necessary
the
cart
will
take
us
rapidly
to
granite
house
good
answered
the
sailor
only
i
have
a
remark
to
make
what
is
it
here
is
the
fine
season
getting
on
and
we
must
not
forget
that
we
have
a
voyage
to
make
a
voyage
said
gideon
spilett
yes
to
tabor
island
answered
pencroft
it
is
necessary
to
carry
a
notice
there
to
point
out
the
position
of
our
island
and
say
that
ayrton
is
here
in
case
the
scotch
yacht
should
come
to
take
him
off
who
knows
if
it
is
not
already
too
late
but
pencroft
asked
ayrton
how
do
you
intend
to
make
this
voyage
in
the
bonadventure
the
bonadventure
exclaimed
ayrton
she
no
longer
exists
my
bonadventure
exists
no
longer
shouted
pencroft
bounding
from
his
seat
no
answered
ayrton
the
convicts
discovered
her
in
her
little
harbor
only
eight
days
ago
they
put
to
sea
in
her
and
said
pencroft
his
heart
beating
and
not
having
bob
harvey
to
steer
her
they
ran
on
the
rocks
and
the
vessel
went
to
pieces
oh
the
villains
the
cutthroats
the
infamous
scoundrels
exclaimed
pencroft
pencroft
said
herbert
taking
the
sailors
hand
we
will
build
another
bonadventurea
larger
one
we
have
all
the
ironworkall
the
rigging
of
the
brig
at
our
disposal
but
do
you
know
returned
pencroft
that
it
will
take
at
least
five
or
six
months
to
build
a
vessel
of
from
thirty
to
forty
tons
we
can
take
our
time
said
the
reporter
and
we
must
give
up
the
voyage
to
tabor
island
for
this
year
oh
my
bonadventure
my
poor
bonadventure
cried
pencroft
almost
brokenhearted
at
the
destruction
of
the
vessel
of
which
he
was
so
proud
the
loss
of
the
bonadventure
was
certainly
a
thing
to
be
lamented
by
the
colonists
and
it
was
agreed
that
this
loss
should
be
repaired
as
soon
as
possible
this
settled
they
now
occupied
themselves
with
bringing
their
researches
to
bear
on
the
most
secret
parts
of
the
island
the
exploration
was
commenced
at
daybreak
on
the
19th
of
february
and
lasted
an
entire
week
the
base
of
the
mountain
with
its
spurs
and
their
numberless
ramifications
formed
a
labyrinth
of
valleys
and
elevations
it
was
evident
that
there
in
the
depths
of
these
narrow
gorges
perhaps
even
in
the
interior
of
mount
franklin
itself
was
the
proper
place
to
pursue
their
researches
no
part
of
the
island
could
have
been
more
suitable
to
conceal
a
dwelling
whose
occupant
wished
to
remain
unknown
but
so
irregular
was
the
formation
of
the
valleys
that
cyrus
harding
was
obliged
to
conduct
the
exploration
in
a
strictly
methodical
manner
the
colonists
first
visited
the
valley
opening
to
the
south
of
the
volcano
and
which
first
received
the
waters
of
falls
river
there
ayrton
showed
them
the
cavern
where
the
convicts
had
taken
refuge
and
in
which
he
had
been
imprisoned
until
his
removal
to
the
corral
this
cavern
was
just
as
ayrton
had
left
it
they
found
there
a
considerable
quantity
of
ammunition
and
provisions
conveyed
thither
by
the
convicts
in
order
to
form
a
reserve
the
whole
of
the
valley
bordering
on
the
cave
shaded
by
fir
and
other
trees
was
thoroughly
explored
and
on
turning
the
point
of
the
southwestern
spur
the
colonists
entered
a
narrower
gorge
similar
to
the
picturesque
columns
of
basalt
on
the
coast
here
the
trees
were
fewer
stones
took
the
place
of
grass
goats
and
musmons
gambolled
among
the
rocks
here
began
the
barren
part
of
the
island
it
could
already
be
seen
that
of
the
numerous
valleys
branching
off
at
the
base
of
mount
franklin
three
only
were
wooded
and
rich
in
pasturage
like
that
of
the
corral
which
bordered
on
the
west
on
the
falls
river
valley
and
on
the
east
on
the
red
creek
valley
these
two
streams
which
lower
down
became
rivers
by
the
absorption
of
several
tributaries
were
formed
by
all
the
springs
of
the
mountain
and
thus
caused
the
fertility
of
its
southern
part
as
to
the
mercy
it
was
more
directly
fed
from
ample
springs
concealed
under
the
cover
of
jacamar
wood
and
it
was
by
springs
of
this
nature
spreading
in
a
thousand
streamlets
that
the
soil
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
was
watered
now
of
these
three
wellwatered
valleys
either
might
have
served
as
a
retreat
to
some
solitary
who
would
have
found
there
everything
necessary
for
life
but
the
settlers
had
already
explored
them
and
in
no
part
had
they
discovered
the
presence
of
man
was
it
then
in
the
depths
of
those
barren
gorges
in
the
midst
of
the
piles
of
rock
in
the
rugged
northern
ravines
among
the
streams
of
lava
that
this
dwelling
and
its
occupant
would
be
found
the
northern
part
of
mount
franklin
was
at
its
base
composed
solely
of
two
valleys
wide
not
very
deep
without
any
appearance
of
vegetation
strewn
with
masses
of
rock
paved
with
lava
and
varied
with
great
blocks
of
mineral
this
region
required
a
long
and
careful
exploration
it
contained
a
thousand
cavities
comfortless
no
doubt
but
perfectly
concealed
and
difficult
of
access
the
colonists
even
visited
dark
tunnels
dating
from
the
volcanic
period
still
black
from
the
passage
of
the
fire
and
penetrated
into
the
depths
of
the
mountain
they
traversed
these
somber
galleries
waving
lighted
torches
they
examined
the
smallest
excavations
they
sounded
the
shallowest
depths
but
all
was
dark
and
silent
it
did
not
appear
that
the
foot
of
man
had
ever
before
trodden
these
ancient
passages
or
that
his
arm
had
ever
displaced
one
of
these
blocks
which
remained
as
the
volcano
had
cast
them
up
above
the
waters
at
the
time
of
the
submersion
of
the
island
however
although
these
passages
appeared
to
be
absolutely
deserted
and
the
obscurity
was
complete
cyrus
harding
was
obliged
to
confess
that
absolute
silence
did
not
reign
there
on
arriving
at
the
end
of
one
of
these
gloomy
caverns
extending
several
hundred
feet
into
the
interior
of
the
mountain
he
was
surprised
to
hear
a
deep
rumbling
noise
increased
in
intensity
by
the
sonorousness
of
the
rocks
gideon
spilett
who
accompanied
him
also
heard
these
distant
mutterings
which
indicated
a
revivification
of
the
subterranean
fires
several
times
both
listened
and
they
agreed
that
some
chemical
process
was
taking
place
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
then
the
volcano
is
not
totally
extinct
said
the
reporter
it
is
possible
that
since
our
exploration
of
the
crater
replied
cyrus
harding
some
change
has
occurred
any
volcano
although
considered
extinct
may
evidently
again
burst
forth
but
if
an
eruption
of
mount
franklin
occurred
asked
spilett
would
there
not
be
some
danger
to
lincoln
island
i
do
not
think
so
answered
the
reporter
the
crater
that
is
to
say
the
safetyvalve
exists
and
the
overflow
of
smoke
and
lava
would
escape
as
it
did
formerly
by
this
customary
outlet
unless
the
lava
opened
a
new
way
for
itself
towards
the
fertile
parts
of
the
island
and
why
my
dear
spilett
answered
cyrus
harding
should
it
not
follow
the
road
naturally
traced
out
for
it
well
volcanoes
are
capricious
returned
the
reporter
notice
answered
the
engineer
that
the
inclination
of
mount
franklin
favors
the
flow
of
water
towards
the
valleys
which
we
are
exploring
just
now
to
turn
aside
this
flow
an
earthquake
would
be
necessary
to
change
the
mountains
center
of
gravity
but
an
earthquake
is
always
to
be
feared
at
these
times
observed
gideon
spilett
always
replied
the
engineer
especially
when
the
subterranean
forces
begin
to
awake
as
they
risk
meeting
with
some
obstruction
after
a
long
rest
thus
my
dear
spilett
an
eruption
would
be
a
serious
thing
for
us
and
it
would
be
better
that
the
volcano
should
not
have
the
slightest
desire
to
wake
up
but
we
could
not
prevent
it
could
we
at
any
rate
even
if
it
should
occur
i
do
not
think
prospect
heights
would
be
seriously
threatened
between
them
and
the
mountain
the
ground
is
considerably
depressed
and
if
the
lava
should
ever
take
a
course
towards
the
lake
it
would
be
cast
on
the
downs
and
the
neighboring
parts
of
shark
gulf
we
have
not
yet
seen
any
smoke
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
to
indicate
an
approaching
eruption
said
gideon
spilett
no
answered
harding
not
a
vapor
escapes
from
the
crater
for
it
was
only
yesterday
that
i
attentively
surveyed
the
summit
but
it
is
probable
that
at
the
lower
part
of
the
chimney
time
may
have
accumulated
rocks
cinders
hardened
lava
and
that
this
valve
of
which
i
spoke
may
at
any
time
become
overcharged
but
at
the
first
serious
effort
every
obstacle
will
disappear
and
you
may
be
certain
my
dear
spilett
that
neither
the
island
which
is
the
boiler
nor
the
volcano
which
is
the
chimney
will
burst
under
the
pressure
of
gas
nevertheless
i
repeat
it
would
be
better
that
there
should
not
be
an
eruption
and
yet
we
are
not
mistaken
remarked
the
reporter
mutterings
can
be
distinctly
heard
in
the
very
bowels
of
the
volcano
you
are
right
said
the
engineer
again
listening
attentively
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
a
commotion
is
going
on
there
of
which
we
can
neither
estimate
the
importance
nor
the
ultimate
result
cyrus
harding
and
spilett
on
coming
out
rejoined
their
companions
to
whom
they
made
known
the
state
of
affairs
very
well
cried
pencroft
the
volcano
wants
to
play
his
pranks
let
him
try
if
he
likes
he
will
find
his
master
who
asked
neb
our
good
genius
neb
our
good
genius
who
will
shut
his
mouth
for
him
if
he
so
much
as
pretends
to
open
it
as
may
be
seen
the
sailors
confidence
in
the
tutelary
deity
of
his
island
was
absolute
and
certainly
the
occult
power
manifested
until
now
in
so
many
inexplicable
ways
appeared
to
be
unlimited
but
also
it
knew
how
to
escape
the
colonists
most
minute
researches
for
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
in
spite
of
the
more
than
zealthe
obstinacywith
which
they
carried
on
their
exploration
the
retreat
of
the
mysterious
being
could
not
be
discovered
from
the
19th
to
the
20th
of
february
the
circle
of
investigation
was
extended
to
all
the
northern
region
of
lincoln
island
whose
most
secret
nooks
were
explored
the
colonists
even
went
the
length
of
tapping
every
rock
the
search
was
extended
to
the
extreme
verge
of
the
mountain
it
was
explored
thus
to
the
very
summit
of
the
truncated
cone
terminating
the
first
row
of
rocks
then
to
the
upper
ridge
of
the
enormous
hat
at
the
bottom
of
which
opened
the
crater
they
did
more
they
visited
the
gulf
now
extinct
but
in
whose
depths
the
rumbling
could
be
distinctly
heard
however
no
sign
of
smoke
or
vapor
no
heating
of
the
rock
indicated
an
approaching
eruption
but
neither
there
nor
in
any
other
part
of
mount
franklin
did
the
colonists
find
any
traces
of
him
of
whom
they
were
in
search
their
investigations
were
then
directed
to
the
downs
they
carefully
examined
the
high
lavacliffs
of
shark
gulf
from
the
base
to
the
crest
although
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
reach
even
the
level
of
the
gulf
no
onenothing
indeed
in
these
three
words
was
summed
up
so
much
fatigue
uselessly
expended
so
much
energy
producing
no
results
that
somewhat
of
anger
mingled
with
the
discomfiture
of
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
it
was
now
time
to
think
of
returning
for
these
researches
could
not
be
prolonged
indefinitely
the
colonists
were
certainly
right
in
believing
that
the
mysterious
being
did
not
reside
on
the
surface
of
the
island
and
the
wildest
fancies
haunted
their
excited
imaginations
pencroft
and
neb
particularly
were
not
contented
with
the
mystery
but
allowed
their
imaginations
to
wander
into
the
domain
of
the
supernatural
on
the
25th
of
february
the
colonists
reentered
granite
house
and
by
means
of
the
double
cord
carried
by
an
arrow
to
the
threshold
of
the
door
they
reestablished
communication
between
their
habitation
and
the
ground
a
month
later
they
commemorated
on
the
25th
of
march
the
third
anniversary
of
their
arrival
on
lincoln
island
chapter
14
three
years
had
passed
away
since
the
escape
of
the
prisoners
from
richmond
and
how
often
during
those
three
years
had
they
spoken
of
their
country
always
present
in
their
thoughts
they
had
no
doubt
that
the
civil
war
was
at
an
end
and
to
them
it
appeared
impossible
that
the
just
cause
of
the
north
had
not
triumphed
but
what
had
been
the
incidents
of
this
terrible
war
how
much
blood
had
it
not
cost
how
many
of
their
friends
must
have
fallen
in
the
struggle
they
often
spoke
of
these
things
without
as
yet
being
able
to
foresee
the
day
when
they
would
be
permitted
once
more
to
see
their
country
to
return
thither
were
it
but
for
a
few
days
to
renew
the
social
link
with
the
inhabited
world
to
establish
a
communication
between
their
native
land
and
their
island
then
to
pass
the
longest
perhaps
the
best
portion
of
their
existence
in
this
colony
founded
by
them
and
which
would
then
be
dependent
on
their
country
was
this
a
dream
impossible
to
realize
there
were
only
two
ways
of
accomplishing
iteither
a
ship
must
appear
off
lincoln
island
or
the
colonists
must
themselves
build
a
vessel
strong
enough
to
sail
to
the
nearest
land
unless
said
pencroft
our
good
genius
himself
provides
us
with
the
means
of
returning
to
our
country
and
really
had
any
one
told
pencroft
and
neb
that
a
ship
of
300
tons
was
waiting
for
them
in
shark
gulf
or
at
port
balloon
they
would
not
even
have
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
in
their
state
of
mind
nothing
appeared
improbable
but
cyrus
harding
less
confident
advised
them
to
confine
themselves
to
fact
and
more
especially
so
with
regard
to
the
building
of
a
vessela
really
urgent
work
since
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
depositing
as
soon
as
possible
at
tabor
island
a
document
indicating
ayrtons
new
residence
as
the
bonadventure
no
longer
existed
six
months
at
least
would
be
required
for
the
construction
of
a
new
vessel
now
winter
was
approaching
and
the
voyage
would
not
be
made
before
the
following
spring
we
have
time
to
get
everything
ready
for
the
fine
season
remarked
the
engineer
who
was
consulting
with
pencroft
about
these
matters
i
think
therefore
my
friend
that
since
we
have
to
rebuild
our
vessel
it
will
be
best
to
give
her
larger
dimensions
the
arrival
of
the
scotch
yacht
at
tabor
island
is
very
uncertain
it
may
even
be
that
having
arrived
several
months
ago
she
has
again
sailed
after
having
vainly
searched
for
some
trace
of
ayrton
will
it
not
then
be
best
to
build
a
ship
which
if
necessary
could
take
us
either
to
the
polynesian
archipelago
or
to
new
zealand
what
do
you
think
i
think
captain
answered
the
sailor
i
think
that
you
are
as
capable
of
building
a
large
vessel
as
a
small
one
neither
the
wood
nor
the
tools
are
wanting
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
and
how
many
months
would
be
required
to
build
a
vessel
of
from
250
to
300
tons
asked
harding
seven
or
eight
months
at
least
replied
pencroft
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
winter
is
drawing
near
and
that
in
severe
frost
wood
is
difficult
to
work
we
must
calculate
on
several
weeks
delay
and
if
our
vessel
is
ready
by
next
november
we
may
think
ourselves
very
lucky
well
replied
cyrus
harding
that
will
be
exactly
the
most
favorable
time
for
undertaking
a
voyage
of
any
importance
either
to
tabor
island
or
to
a
more
distant
land
so
it
will
captain
answered
the
sailor
make
out
your
plans
then
the
workmen
are
ready
and
i
imagine
that
ayrton
can
lend
us
a
good
helping
hand
the
colonists
having
been
consulted
approved
the
engineers
plan
and
it
was
indeed
the
best
thing
to
be
done
it
is
true
that
the
construction
of
a
ship
of
from
two
to
three
hundred
tons
would
be
great
labor
but
the
colonists
had
confidence
in
themselves
justified
by
their
previous
success
cyrus
harding
then
busied
himself
in
drawing
the
plan
of
the
vessel
and
making
the
model
during
this
time
his
companions
employed
themselves
in
felling
and
carting
trees
to
furnish
the
ribs
timbers
and
planks
the
forest
of
the
far
west
supplied
the
best
oaks
and
elms
they
took
advantage
of
the
opening
already
made
on
their
last
excursion
to
form
a
practicable
road
which
they
named
the
far
west
road
and
the
trees
were
carried
to
the
chimneys
where
the
dockyard
was
established
as
to
the
road
in
question
the
choice
of
trees
had
rendered
its
direction
somewhat
capricious
but
at
the
same
time
it
facilitated
the
access
to
a
large
part
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
it
was
important
that
the
trees
should
be
quickly
felled
and
cut
up
for
they
could
not
be
used
while
yet
green
and
some
time
was
necessary
to
allow
them
to
get
seasoned
the
carpenters
therefore
worked
vigorously
during
the
month
of
april
which
was
troubled
only
by
a
few
equinoctial
gales
of
some
violence
master
jup
aided
them
dexterously
either
by
climbing
to
the
top
of
a
tree
to
fasten
the
ropes
or
by
lending
his
stout
shoulders
to
carry
the
lopped
trunks
all
this
timber
was
piled
up
under
a
large
shed
built
near
the
chimneys
and
there
awaited
the
time
for
use
the
month
of
april
was
tolerably
fine
as
october
often
is
in
the
northern
zone
at
the
same
time
other
work
was
actively
continued
and
soon
all
trace
of
devastation
disappeared
from
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
the
mill
was
rebuilt
and
new
buildings
rose
in
the
poultryyard
it
had
appeared
necessary
to
enlarge
their
dimensions
for
the
feathered
population
had
increased
considerably
the
stable
now
contained
five
onagers
four
of
which
were
well
broken
and
allowed
themselves
to
be
either
driven
or
ridden
and
a
little
colt
the
colony
now
possessed
a
plow
to
which
the
onagers
were
yoked
like
regular
yorkshire
or
kentucky
oxen
the
colonists
divided
their
work
and
their
arms
never
tired
then
who
could
have
enjoyed
better
health
than
these
workers
and
what
good
humor
enlivened
the
evenings
in
granite
house
as
they
formed
a
thousand
plans
for
the
future
as
a
matter
of
course
ayrton
shared
the
common
lot
in
every
respect
and
there
was
no
longer
any
talk
of
his
going
to
live
at
the
corral
nevertheless
he
was
still
sad
and
reserved
and
joined
more
in
the
work
than
in
the
pleasures
of
his
companions
but
he
was
a
valuable
workman
at
needstrong
skilful
ingenious
intelligent
he
was
esteemed
and
loved
by
all
and
he
could
not
be
ignorant
of
it
in
the
meanwhile
the
corral
was
not
abandoned
every
other
day
one
of
the
settlers
driving
the
cart
or
mounted
on
an
onager
went
to
look
after
the
flock
of
musmons
and
goats
and
bring
back
the
supply
of
milk
required
by
neb
these
excursions
at
the
same
time
afforded
opportunities
for
hunting
therefore
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
with
top
in
front
traversed
more
often
than
their
companions
the
road
to
the
corral
and
with
the
capital
guns
which
they
carried
capybaras
agouties
kangaroos
and
wild
pigs
for
large
game
ducks
grouse
jacamars
and
snipe
for
small
game
were
never
wanting
in
the
house
the
produce
of
the
warren
of
the
oysterbed
several
turtles
which
were
taken
excellent
salmon
which
came
up
the
mercy
vegetables
from
the
plateau
wild
fruit
from
the
forest
were
riches
upon
riches
and
neb
the
head
cook
could
scarcely
by
himself
store
them
away
the
telegraphic
wire
between
the
corral
and
granite
house
had
of
course
been
repaired
and
it
was
worked
whenever
one
or
other
of
the
settlers
was
at
the
corral
and
found
it
necessary
to
spend
the
night
there
besides
the
island
was
safe
now
and
no
attacks
were
to
be
feared
at
any
rate
from
men
however
that
which
had
happened
might
happen
again
a
descent
of
pirates
or
even
of
escaped
convicts
was
always
to
be
feared
it
was
possible
that
companions
or
accomplices
of
bob
harvey
had
been
in
the
secret
of
his
plans
and
might
be
tempted
to
imitate
him
the
colonists
therefore
were
careful
to
observe
the
sea
around
the
island
and
every
day
their
telescope
covered
the
horizon
enclosed
by
union
and
washington
bays
when
they
went
to
the
corral
they
examined
the
sea
to
the
west
with
no
less
attention
and
by
climbing
the
spur
their
gaze
extended
over
a
large
section
of
the
western
horizon
nothing
suspicious
was
discerned
but
still
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
be
on
their
guard
the
engineer
one
evening
imparted
to
his
friends
a
plan
which
he
had
conceived
for
fortifying
the
corral
it
appeared
prudent
to
him
to
heighten
the
palisade
and
to
flank
it
with
a
sort
of
blockhouse
which
if
necessary
the
settlers
could
hold
against
the
enemy
granite
house
might
by
its
very
position
be
considered
impregnable
therefore
the
corral
with
its
buildings
its
stores
and
the
animals
it
contained
would
always
be
the
object
of
pirates
whoever
they
were
who
might
land
on
the
island
and
should
the
colonists
be
obliged
to
shut
themselves
up
there
they
ought
also
to
be
able
to
defend
themselves
without
any
disadvantage
this
was
a
project
which
might
be
left
for
consideration
and
they
were
besides
obliged
to
put
off
its
execution
until
the
next
spring
about
the
15th
of
may
the
keel
of
the
new
vessel
lay
along
the
dockyard
and
soon
the
stem
and
sternpost
mortised
at
each
of
its
extremities
rose
almost
perpendicularly
the
keel
of
good
oak
measured
110
feet
in
length
this
allowing
a
width
of
fiveandtwenty
feet
to
the
midship
beam
but
this
was
all
the
carpenters
could
do
before
the
arrival
of
the
frosts
and
bad
weather
during
the
following
week
they
fixed
the
first
of
the
stern
timbers
but
were
then
obliged
to
suspend
work
during
the
last
days
of
the
month
the
weather
was
extremely
bad
the
wind
blew
from
the
east
sometimes
with
the
violence
of
a
tempest
the
engineer
was
somewhat
uneasy
on
account
of
the
dockyard
shedwhich
besides
he
could
not
have
established
in
any
other
place
near
to
granite
housefor
the
islet
only
imperfectly
sheltered
the
shore
from
the
fury
of
the
open
sea
and
in
great
storms
the
waves
beat
against
the
very
foot
of
the
granite
cliff
but
very
fortunately
these
fears
were
not
realized
the
wind
shifted
to
the
southeast
and
there
the
beach
of
granite
house
was
completely
covered
by
flotsam
point
pencroft
and
ayrton
the
most
zealous
workmen
at
the
new
vessel
pursued
their
labor
as
long
as
they
could
they
were
not
men
to
mind
the
wind
tearing
at
their
hair
nor
the
rain
wetting
them
to
the
skin
and
a
blow
from
a
hammer
is
worth
just
as
much
in
bad
as
in
fine
weather
but
when
a
severe
frost
succeeded
this
wet
period
the
wood
its
fibers
acquiring
the
hardness
of
iron
became
extremely
difficult
to
work
and
about
the
10th
of
june
shipbuilding
was
obliged
to
be
entirely
discontinued
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
had
not
omitted
to
observe
how
severe
was
the
temperature
during
the
winters
of
lincoln
island
the
cold
was
comparable
to
that
experienced
in
the
states
of
new
england
situated
at
almost
the
same
distance
from
the
equator
in
the
northern
hemisphere
or
at
any
rate
in
the
part
occupied
by
british
america
and
the
north
of
the
united
states
this
phenomenon
is
explained
by
the
flat
conformation
of
the
territories
bordering
on
the
pole
and
on
which
there
is
no
intumescence
of
the
soil
to
oppose
any
obstacle
to
the
north
winds
here
in
lincoln
island
this
explanation
would
not
suffice
it
has
even
been
observed
remarked
harding
one
day
to
his
companions
that
in
equal
latitudes
the
islands
and
coast
regions
are
less
tried
by
the
cold
than
inland
countries
i
have
often
heard
it
asserted
that
the
winters
of
lombardy
for
example
are
not
less
rigorous
than
those
of
scotland
which
results
from
the
sea
restoring
during
the
winter
the
heat
which
it
received
during
the
summer
islands
are
therefore
in
a
better
situation
for
benefiting
by
this
restitution
but
then
captain
harding
asked
herbert
why
does
lincoln
island
appear
to
escape
the
common
law
that
is
difficult
to
explain
answered
the
engineer
however
i
should
be
disposed
to
conjecture
that
this
peculiarity
results
from
the
situation
of
the
island
in
the
southern
hemisphere
which
as
you
know
my
boy
is
colder
than
the
northern
hemisphere
yes
said
herbert
and
icebergs
are
met
with
in
lower
latitudes
in
the
south
than
in
the
north
of
the
pacific
that
is
true
remarked
pencroft
and
when
i
have
been
serving
on
board
whalers
i
have
seen
icebergs
off
cape
horn
the
severe
cold
experienced
in
lincoln
island
said
gideon
spilett
may
then
perhaps
be
explained
by
the
presence
of
floes
or
icebergs
comparatively
near
to
lincoln
island
your
opinion
is
very
admissible
indeed
my
dear
spilett
answered
cyrus
harding
and
it
is
evidently
to
the
proximity
of
icebergs
that
we
owe
our
rigorous
winters
i
would
draw
your
attention
also
to
an
entirely
physical
cause
which
renders
the
southern
colder
than
the
northern
hemisphere
in
fact
since
the
sun
is
nearer
to
this
hemisphere
during
the
summer
it
is
necessarily
more
distant
during
the
winter
this
explains
then
the
excess
of
temperature
in
the
two
seasons
for
if
we
find
the
winters
very
cold
in
lincoln
island
we
must
not
forget
that
the
summers
here
on
the
contrary
are
very
hot
but
why
if
you
please
captain
asked
pencroft
knitting
his
brows
why
should
our
hemisphere
as
you
say
be
so
badly
divided
it
isnt
just
that
friend
pencroft
answered
the
engineer
laughing
whether
just
or
not
we
must
submit
to
it
and
here
lies
the
reason
for
this
peculiarity
the
earth
does
not
describe
a
circle
around
the
sun
but
an
ellipse
as
it
must
by
the
laws
of
rational
mechanics
now
the
earth
occupies
one
of
the
foci
of
the
ellipse
and
so
at
one
point
in
its
course
is
at
its
apogee
that
is
at
its
farthest
from
the
sun
and
at
another
point
it
is
at
its
perigee
or
nearest
to
the
sun
now
it
happens
that
it
is
during
the
winter
of
the
southern
countries
that
it
is
at
its
most
distant
point
from
the
sun
and
consequently
in
a
situation
for
those
regions
to
feel
the
greatest
cold
nothing
can
be
done
to
prevent
that
and
men
pencroft
however
learned
they
may
be
can
never
change
anything
of
the
cosmographical
order
established
by
god
himself
and
yet
added
pencroft
the
world
is
very
learned
what
a
big
book
captain
might
be
made
with
all
that
is
known
and
what
a
much
bigger
book
still
with
all
that
is
not
known
answered
harding
at
last
for
one
reason
or
another
the
month
of
june
brought
the
cold
with
its
accustomed
intensity
and
the
settlers
were
often
confined
to
granite
house
ah
how
wearisome
this
imprisonment
was
to
them
and
more
particularly
to
gideon
spilett
look
here
said
he
to
neb
one
day
i
would
give
you
by
notarial
deed
all
the
estates
which
will
come
to
me
some
day
if
you
were
a
good
enough
fellow
to
go
no
matter
where
and
subscribe
to
some
newspaper
for
me
decidedly
the
thing
that
is
most
essential
to
my
happiness
is
the
knowing
every
morning
what
has
happened
the
day
before
in
other
places
than
this
neb
began
to
laugh
pon
my
word
he
replied
the
only
thing
i
think
about
is
my
daily
work
the
truth
was
that
indoors
as
well
as
out
there
was
no
want
of
work
the
colony
of
lincoln
island
was
now
at
its
highest
point
of
prosperity
achieved
by
three
years
of
continued
hard
work
the
destruction
of
the
brig
had
been
a
new
source
of
riches
without
speaking
of
the
complete
rig
which
would
serve
for
the
vessel
now
on
the
stocks
utensils
and
tools
of
all
sorts
weapons
and
ammunition
clothes
and
instruments
were
now
piled
in
the
storerooms
of
granite
house
it
had
not
even
been
necessary
to
resort
again
to
the
manufacture
of
the
coarse
felt
materials
though
the
colonists
had
suffered
from
cold
during
their
first
winter
the
bad
season
might
now
come
without
their
having
any
reason
to
dread
its
severity
linen
was
plentiful
also
and
besides
they
kept
it
with
extreme
care
from
chloride
of
sodium
which
is
nothing
else
than
sea
salt
cyrus
harding
easily
extracted
the
soda
and
chlorine
the
soda
which
it
was
easy
to
change
into
carbonate
of
soda
and
the
chlorine
of
which
he
made
chloride
of
lime
were
employed
for
various
domestic
purposes
and
especially
in
bleaching
linen
besides
they
did
not
wash
more
than
four
times
a
year
as
was
done
by
families
in
the
olden
times
and
it
may
be
added
that
pencroft
and
gideon
spilett
while
waiting
for
the
postman
to
bring
him
his
newspaper
distinguished
themselves
as
washermen
so
passed
the
winter
months
june
july
and
august
they
were
severe
and
the
average
observations
of
the
thermometer
did
not
give
more
than
eight
degrees
of
fahrenheit
it
was
therefore
lower
in
temperature
than
the
preceding
winter
but
then
what
splendid
fires
blazed
continually
on
the
hearths
of
granite
house
the
smoke
marking
the
granite
wall
with
long
zebralike
streaks
fuel
was
not
spared
as
it
grew
naturally
a
few
steps
from
them
besides
the
chips
of
the
wood
destined
for
the
construction
of
the
ship
enabled
them
to
economize
the
coal
which
required
more
trouble
to
transport
men
and
animals
were
all
well
master
jup
was
a
little
chilly
it
must
be
confessed
this
was
perhaps
his
only
weakness
and
it
was
necessary
to
make
him
a
wellpadded
dressinggown
but
what
a
servant
he
was
clever
zealous
indefatigable
not
indiscreet
not
talkative
and
he
might
have
been
with
reason
proposed
as
a
model
for
all
his
biped
brothers
in
the
old
and
new
worlds
as
for
that
said
pencroft
when
one
has
four
hands
at
ones
service
of
course
ones
work
ought
to
be
done
so
much
the
better
and
indeed
the
intelligent
creature
did
it
well
during
the
seven
months
which
had
passed
since
the
last
researches
made
round
the
mountain
and
during
the
month
of
september
which
brought
back
fine
weather
nothing
was
heard
of
the
genius
of
the
island
his
power
was
not
manifested
in
any
way
it
is
true
that
it
would
have
been
superfluous
for
no
incident
occurred
to
put
the
colonists
to
any
painful
trial
cyrus
harding
even
observed
that
if
by
chance
the
communication
between
the
unknown
and
the
tenants
of
granite
house
had
ever
been
established
through
the
granite
and
if
tops
instinct
had
as
it
were
felt
it
there
was
no
further
sign
of
it
during
this
period
the
dogs
growling
had
entirely
ceased
as
well
as
the
uneasiness
of
the
orang
the
two
friendsfor
they
were
suchno
longer
prowled
round
the
opening
of
the
inner
well
nor
did
they
bark
or
whine
in
that
singular
way
which
from
the
first
the
engineer
had
noticed
but
could
he
be
sure
that
this
was
all
that
was
to
be
said
about
this
enigma
and
that
he
should
never
arrive
at
a
solution
could
he
be
certain
that
some
conjuncture
would
not
occur
which
would
bring
the
mysterious
personage
on
the
scene
who
could
tell
what
the
future
might
have
in
reserve
at
last
the
winter
was
ended
but
an
event
the
consequences
of
which
might
be
serious
occurred
in
the
first
days
of
the
returning
spring
on
the
7th
of
september
cyrus
harding
having
observed
the
crater
saw
smoke
curling
round
the
summit
of
the
mountain
its
first
vapors
rising
in
the
air
chapter
15
the
colonists
warned
by
the
engineer
left
their
work
and
gazed
in
silence
at
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
the
volcano
had
awoke
and
the
vapor
had
penetrated
the
mineral
layer
heaped
at
the
bottom
of
the
crater
but
would
the
subterranean
fires
provoke
any
violent
eruption
this
was
an
event
which
could
not
be
foreseen
however
even
while
admitting
the
possibility
of
an
eruption
it
was
not
probable
that
the
whole
of
lincoln
island
would
suffer
from
it
the
flow
of
volcanic
matter
is
not
always
disastrous
and
the
island
had
already
undergone
this
trial
as
was
shown
by
the
streams
of
lava
hardened
on
the
northern
slopes
of
the
mountain
besides
from
the
shape
of
the
craterthe
opening
broken
in
the
upper
edgethe
matter
would
be
thrown
to
the
side
opposite
the
fertile
regions
of
the
island
however
the
past
did
not
necessarily
answer
for
the
future
often
at
the
summit
of
volcanoes
the
old
craters
close
and
new
ones
open
this
had
occurred
in
the
two
hemispheresat
etna
popocatepetl
at
orizabaand
on
the
eve
of
an
eruption
there
is
everything
to
be
feared
in
fact
an
earthquakea
phenomenon
which
often
accompanies
volcanic
eruptionis
enough
to
change
the
interior
arrangement
of
a
mountain
and
to
open
new
outlets
for
the
burning
lava
cyrus
harding
explained
these
things
to
his
companions
and
without
exaggerating
the
state
of
things
he
told
them
all
the
pros
and
cons
after
all
they
could
not
prevent
it
it
did
not
appear
likely
that
granite
house
would
be
threatened
unless
the
ground
was
shaken
by
an
earthquake
but
the
corral
would
be
in
great
danger
should
a
new
crater
open
in
the
southern
side
of
mount
franklin
from
that
day
the
smoke
never
disappeared
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
it
could
even
be
perceived
that
it
increased
in
height
and
thickness
without
any
flame
mingling
in
its
heavy
volumes
the
phenomenon
was
still
concentrated
in
the
lower
part
of
the
central
crater
however
with
the
fine
days
work
had
been
continued
the
building
of
the
vessel
was
hastened
as
much
as
possible
and
by
means
of
the
waterfall
on
the
shore
cyrus
harding
managed
to
establish
an
hydraulic
sawmill
which
rapidly
cut
up
the
trunks
of
trees
into
planks
and
joists
the
mechanism
of
this
apparatus
was
as
simple
as
those
used
in
the
rustic
sawmills
of
norway
a
first
horizontal
movement
to
move
the
piece
of
wood
a
second
vertical
movement
to
move
the
sawthis
was
all
that
was
wanted
and
the
engineer
succeeded
by
means
of
a
wheel
two
cylinders
and
pulleys
properly
arranged
towards
the
end
of
the
month
of
september
the
skeleton
of
the
vessel
which
was
to
be
rigged
as
a
schooner
lay
in
the
dockyard
the
ribs
were
almost
entirely
completed
and
all
the
timbers
having
been
sustained
by
a
provisional
band
the
shape
of
the
vessel
could
already
be
seen
the
schooner
sharp
in
the
bows
very
slender
in
the
afterpart
would
evidently
be
suitable
for
a
long
voyage
if
wanted
but
laying
the
planking
would
still
take
a
considerable
time
very
fortunately
the
iron
work
of
the
pirate
brig
had
been
saved
after
the
explosion
from
the
planks
and
injured
ribs
pencroft
and
ayrton
had
extracted
the
bolts
and
a
large
quantity
of
copper
nails
it
was
so
much
work
saved
for
the
smiths
but
the
carpenters
had
much
to
do
shipbuilding
was
interrupted
for
a
week
for
the
harvest
the
haymaking
and
the
gathering
in
of
the
different
crops
on
the
plateau
this
work
finished
every
moment
was
devoted
to
finishing
the
schooner
when
night
came
the
workmen
were
really
quite
exhausted
so
as
not
to
lose
any
time
they
had
changed
the
hours
for
their
meals
they
dined
at
twelve
oclock
and
only
had
their
supper
when
daylight
failed
them
they
then
ascended
to
granite
house
when
they
were
always
ready
to
go
to
bed
sometimes
however
when
the
conversation
bore
on
some
interesting
subject
the
hour
for
sleep
was
delayed
for
a
time
the
colonists
then
spoke
of
the
future
and
talked
willingly
of
the
changes
which
a
voyage
in
the
schooner
to
inhabited
lands
would
make
in
their
situation
but
always
in
the
midst
of
these
plans
prevailed
the
thought
of
a
subsequent
return
to
lincoln
island
never
would
they
abandon
this
colony
founded
with
so
much
labor
and
with
such
success
and
to
which
a
communication
with
america
would
afford
a
fresh
impetus
pencroft
and
neb
especially
hoped
to
end
their
days
there
herbert
said
the
sailor
you
will
never
abandon
lincoln
island
never
pencroft
and
especially
if
you
make
up
your
mind
to
stay
there
that
was
made
up
long
ago
my
boy
answered
pencroft
i
shall
expect
you
you
will
bring
me
your
wife
and
children
and
i
shall
make
jolly
chaps
of
your
youngsters
thats
agreed
replied
herbert
laughing
and
blushing
at
the
same
time
and
you
captain
harding
resumed
pencroft
enthusiastically
you
will
be
still
the
governor
of
the
island
ah
how
many
inhabitants
could
it
support
ten
thousand
at
least
they
talked
in
this
way
allowing
pencroft
to
run
on
and
at
last
the
reporter
actually
started
a
newspaperthe
new
lincoln
herald
so
is
mans
heart
the
desire
to
perform
a
work
which
will
endure
which
will
survive
him
is
the
origin
of
his
superiority
over
all
other
living
creatures
here
below
it
is
this
which
has
established
his
dominion
and
this
it
is
which
justifies
it
over
all
the
world
after
that
who
knows
if
jup
and
top
had
not
themselves
their
little
dream
of
the
future
ayrton
silently
said
to
himself
that
he
would
like
to
see
lord
glenarvan
again
and
show
himself
to
all
restored
one
evening
on
the
15th
of
october
the
conversation
was
prolonged
later
than
usual
it
was
nine
oclock
already
long
badly
concealed
yawns
gave
warning
of
the
hour
of
rest
and
pencroft
was
proceeding
towards
his
bed
when
the
electric
bell
placed
in
the
diningroom
suddenly
rang

therefore
none
of
the

were
at
the
corral
cyrus
harding
rose
his
companions
stared
at
each
other
scarcely
believing
their
ears
what
does
that
mean
cried
neb
was
it
the

rang
it
no

its

herbert
did
not
finish
his
phrase
the
engineer
towards
whom
all
eyes
were
turned
shook
his
head
negatively
we
must
wait
said
gideon
spilett
if
it
is
a
signal
whoever
it
may
be
who
has
made
it

will
renew
it

who
do
you
think
it
is
cried
neb
who
answered
pencroft
but
he
the
sailors
sentence
was
cut
short
by
a
new
tinkle
of
the
bell
harding
went
to
the
apparatus
and
sent
this
question
to
the
corral
what
do
you
want
a
few
moments
later
the
needle
moving
on
the
alphabetic
dial
gave
this
reply
to
the
tenants
of
granite
house
come
to
the
corral
immediately
at
last
exclaimed
harding
yes
at
last
the
mystery
was
about
to
be
unveiled
the
colonists
fatigue
had
disappeared
before
the
tremendous
interest
which
was
about
to
urge
them
to
the
corral
and
all
wish
for
rest
had
ceased
without
having
uttered
a
word
in
a
few
moments
they
had
left
granite
house
and
were
standing
on
the
beach
jup
and
top
alone
were
left
behind
they
could
do
without
them
the
night
was
black
the
new
moon
had
disappeared
at
the
same
time
as
the
sun
as
herbert
had
observed
great
stormy
clouds
formed
a
lowering
and
heavy
vault
preventing
any
star
rays
a
few
lightning
flashes
reflections
from
a
distant
storm
illuminated
the
horizon
it
was
possible
that
a
few
hours
later
the
thunder
would
roll
over
the
island
itself
the
night
was
very
threatening
but
however
deep
the
darkness
was
it
would
not
prevent
them
from
finding
the
familiar
road
to
the
corral
they
ascended
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
reached
the
plateau
passed
the
bridge
over
creek
glycerine
and
advanced
through
the
forest
they
walked
at
a
good
pace
a
prey
to
the
liveliest
emotions
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
they
were
now
going
to
learn
the
longsearchedfor
answer
to
the
enigma
the
name
of
that
mysterious
being
so
deeply
concerned
in
their
life
so
generous
in
his
influence
so
powerful
in
his
action
must
not
this
stranger
have
indeed
mingled
with
their
existence
have
known
the
smallest
details
have
heard
all
that
was
said
in
granite
house
to
have
been
able
always
to
act
in
the
very
nick
of
time
every
one
wrapped
up
in
his
own
reflections
pressed
forward
under
the
arch
of
trees
the
darkness
was
such
that
even
the
edge
of
the
road
could
not
be
seen
not
a
sound
in
the
forest
both
animals
and
birds
influenced
by
the
heaviness
of
the
atmosphere
remained
motionless
and
silent
not
a
breath
disturbed
the
leaves
the
footsteps
of
the
colonists
alone
resounded
on
the
hardened
ground
during
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
the
silence
was
only
interrupted
by
this
remark
from
pencroft
we
ought
to
have
brought
a
torch
and
by
this
reply
from
the
engineer
we
shall
find
one
at
the
corral
harding
and
his
companions
had
left
granite
house
at
twelve
minutes
past
nine
at
fortyseven
minutes
past
nine
they
had
traversed
three
out
of
the
five
miles
which
separated
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
from
the
corral
at
that
moment
sheets
of
lightning
spread
over
the
island
and
illumined
the
dark
trees
the
flashes
dazzled
and
almost
blinded
them
evidently
the
storm
would
not
be
long
in
bursting
forth
the
flashes
gradually
became
brighter
and
more
rapid
distant
thunder
growled
in
the
sky
the
atmosphere
was
stifling
the
colonists
proceeded
as
if
they
were
urged
onwards
by
some
irresistible
force
at
ten
oclock
a
vivid
flash
showed
them
the
palisade
and
as
they
reached
the
gate
the
storm
burst
forth
with
tremendous
fury
in
a
minute
the
corral
was
crossed
and
harding
stood
before
the
hut
probably
the
house
was
occupied
by
the
stranger
since
it
was
from
thence
that
the
telegram
had
been
sent
however
no
light
shone
through
the
window
the
engineer
knocked
at
the
door
no
answer
cyrus
harding
opened
the
door
and
the
settlers
entered
the
room
which
was
perfectly
dark
a
light
was
struck
by
neb
and
in
a
few
moments
the
lantern
was
lighted
and
the
light
thrown
into
every
corner
of
the
room
there
was
no
one
there
everything
was
in
the
state
in
which
it
had
been
left
have
we
been
deceived
by
an
illusion
murmured
cyrus
harding
no
that
was
not
possible
the
telegram
had
clearly
said
come
to
the
corral
immediately
they
approached
the
table
specially
devoted
to
the
use
of
the
wire
everything
was
in
orderthe
pile
on
the
box
containing
it
as
well
as
all
the
apparatus
who
came
here
the
last
time
asked
the
engineer
i
did
captain
answered
ayrton
and
that
was
four
days
ago
ah
a
note
cried
herbert
pointing
to
a
paper
lying
on
the
table
on
this
paper
were
written
these
words
in
english
follow
the
new
wire
forward
cried
harding
who
understood
that
the
despatch
had
not
been
sent
from
the
corral
but
from
the
mysterious
retreat
communicating
directly
with
granite
house
by
means
of
a
supplementary
wire
joined
to
the
old
one
neb
took
the
lighted
lantern
and
all
left
the
corral
the
storm
then
burst
forth
with
tremendous
violence
the
interval
between
each
lightningflash
and
each
thunderclap
diminished
rapidly
the
summit
of
the
volcano
with
its
plume
of
vapor
could
be
seen
by
occasional
flashes
there
was
no
telegraphic
communication
in
any
part
of
the
corral
between
the
house
and
the
palisade
but
the
engineer
running
straight
to
the
first
post
saw
by
the
light
of
a
flash
a
new
wire
hanging
from
the
isolator
to
the
ground
there
it
is
said
he
this
wire
lay
along
the
ground
and
was
surrounded
with
an
isolating
substance
like
a
submarine
cable
so
as
to
assure
the
free
transmission
of
the
current
it
appeared
to
pass
through
the
wood
and
the
southern
spurs
of
the
mountain
and
consequently
it
ran
towards
the
west
follow
it
said
cyrus
harding
and
the
settlers
immediately
pressed
forward
guided
by
the
wire
the
thunder
continued
to
roar
with
such
violence
that
not
a
word
could
be
heard
however
there
was
no
occasion
for
speaking
but
to
get
forward
as
fast
as
possible
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
then
climbed
the
spur
rising
between
the
corral
valley
and
that
of
falls
river
which
they
crossed
at
its
narrowest
part
the
wire
sometimes
stretched
over
the
lower
branches
of
the
trees
sometimes
lying
on
the
ground
guided
them
surely
the
engineer
had
supposed
that
the
wire
would
perhaps
stop
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
that
the
strangers
retreat
would
be
there
nothing
of
the
sort
they
were
obliged
to
ascend
the
southwestern
spur
and
redescend
on
that
arid
plateau
terminated
by
the
strangelywild
basalt
cliff
from
time
to
time
one
of
the
colonists
stooped
down
and
felt
for
the
wire
with
his
hands
but
there
was
now
no
doubt
that
the
wire
was
running
directly
towards
the
sea
there
to
a
certainty
in
the
depths
of
those
rocks
was
the
dwelling
so
long
sought
for
in
vain
the
sky
was
literally
on
fire
flash
succeeded
flash
several
struck
the
summit
of
the
volcano
in
the
midst
of
the
thick
smoke
it
appeared
there
as
if
the
mountain
was
vomiting
flame
at
a
few
minutes
to
eleven
the
colonists
arrived
on
the
high
cliff
overlooking
the
ocean
to
the
west
the
wind
had
risen
the
surf
roared
500
feet
below
harding
calculated
that
they
had
gone
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
corral
at
this
point
the
wire
entered
among
the
rocks
following
the
steep
side
of
a
narrow
ravine
the
settlers
followed
it
at
the
risk
of
occasioning
a
fall
of
the
slightlybalanced
rocks
and
being
dashed
into
the
sea
the
descent
was
extremely
perilous
but
they
did
not
think
of
the
danger
they
were
no
longer
masters
of
themselves
and
an
irresistible
attraction
drew
them
towards
this
mysterious
place
as
the
magnet
draws
iron
thus
they
almost
unconsciously
descended
this
ravine
which
even
in
broad
daylight
would
have
been
considered
impracticable
the
stones
rolled
and
sparkled
like
fiery
balls
when
they
crossed
through
the
gleams
of
light
harding
was
firstayrton
last
on
they
went
step
by
step
now
they
slid
over
the
slippery
rock
then
they
struggled
to
their
feet
and
scrambled
on
at
last
the
wire
touched
the
rocks
on
the
beach
the
colonists
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
basalt
cliff
there
appeared
a
narrow
ridge
running
horizontally
and
parallel
with
the
sea
the
settlers
followed
the
wire
along
it
they
had
not
gone
a
hundred
paces
when
the
ridge
by
a
moderate
incline
sloped
down
to
the
level
of
the
sea
the
engineer
seized
the
wire
and
found
that
it
disappeared
beneath
the
waves
his
companions
were
stupefied
a
cry
of
disappointment
almost
a
cry
of
despair
escaped
them
must
they
then
plunge
beneath
the
water
and
seek
there
for
some
submarine
cavern
in
their
excited
state
they
would
not
have
hesitated
to
do
it
the
engineer
stopped
them
he
led
his
companions
to
a
hollow
in
the
rocks
and
there
we
must
wait
said
he
the
tide
is
high
at
low
water
the
way
will
be
open
but
what
can
make
you
think
asked
pencroft
he
would
not
have
called
us
if
the
means
had
been
wanting
to
enable
us
to
reach
him
cyrus
harding
spoke
in
a
tone
of
such
thorough
conviction
that
no
objection
was
raised
his
remark
besides
was
logical
it
was
quite
possible
that
an
opening
practicable
at
low
water
though
hidden
now
by
the
high
tide
opened
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
there
was
some
time
to
wait
the
colonists
remained
silently
crouching
in
a
deep
hollow
rain
now
began
to
fall
in
torrents
the
thunder
was
reechoed
among
the
rocks
with
a
grand
sonorousness
the
colonists
emotion
was
great
a
thousand
strange
and
extraordinary
ideas
crossed
their
brains
and
they
expected
some
grand
and
superhuman
apparition
which
alone
could
come
up
to
the
notion
they
had
formed
of
the
mysterious
genius
of
the
island
at
midnight
harding
carrying
the
lantern
descended
to
the
beach
to
reconnoiter
the
engineer
was
not
mistaken
the
beginning
of
an
immense
excavation
could
be
seen
under
the
water
there
the
wire
bending
at
a
right
angle
entered
the
yawning
gulf
cyrus
harding
returned
to
his
companions
and
said
simply
in
an
hour
the
opening
will
be
practicable
it
is
there
then
said
pencroft
did
you
doubt
it
returned
harding
but
this
cavern
must
be
filled
with
water
to
a
certain
height
observed
herbert
either
the
cavern
will
be
completely
dry
replied
harding
and
in
that
case
we
can
traverse
it
on
foot
or
it
will
not
be
dry
and
some
means
of
transport
will
be
put
at
our
disposal
an
hour
passed
all
climbed
down
through
the
rain
to
the
level
of
the
sea
there
was
now
eight
feet
of
the
opening
above
the
water
it
was
like
the
arch
of
a
bridge
under
which
rushed
the
foaming
water
leaning
forward
the
engineer
saw
a
black
object
floating
on
the
water
he
drew
it
towards
him
it
was
a
boat
moored
to
some

the

rose

the

for

extend

at

to

he
commanded
the

altering

came
up

the

harding
and
the
two
oars
plunging
into
the
dark
waters
urged
the
boat
onwards
on
they
went
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
and
a
distance
of
halfamile
must
have
been
cleared
from
the
mouth
of
the
cave
when
hardings

was
again
heard

said
he
the
boat
stopped
and
the
colonists
perceived
a
bright
light
illuminating
the
vast
cavern
so
deeply
excavated
in
the
bowels
of
the
island
of
which
nothing
had
ever
led
them
to
suspect
the
existence
at
a
height
of
a
hundred
feet
rose
the
vaulted
roof
supported
on
basalt
shafts
irregular
arches
strange
moldings
appeared
on
the
columns
erected
by
nature
in
thousands
from
the
first
epochs
of
the
formation
of
the
globe
the
basalt
pillars
fitted
one
into
the
other
measured
from
forty
to
fifty
feet
in
height
and
the
water
calm
in
spite
of
the
tumult
outside
washed
their
base
the
brilliant
focus
of
light
pointed
out
by
the
engineer
touched
every
point
of
rocks
and
flooded
the
walls
with
light
by
reflection
the
water
reproduced
the
brilliant
sparkles
so
that
the
boat
appeared
to
be
floating
between
two
glittering
zones
they
could
not
be
mistaken
in
the
nature
of
the
irradiation
thrown
from
the
glowing
nucleus
whose
clear
rays
were
shattered
by
all
the
angles
all
the
projections
of
the
cavern
this
light
proceeded
from
an
electric
source
and
its
white
color
betrayed
its
origin
it
was
the
sun
of
this
cave
and
it
filled
it
entirely
at
a
sign
from
cyrus
harding
the
oars
again
plunged
into
the
water
causing
a
regular
shower
of
gems
and
the
boat
was
urged
forward
towards
the
light
which
was
now
not
more
than
half
a
cables
length
distant
at
this
place
the
breadth
of
the
sheet
of
water
measured
nearly
350
feet
and
beyond
the
dazzling
center
could
be
seen
an
enormous
basaltic
wall
blocking
up
any
issue
on
that
side
the
cavern
widened
here
considerably
the
sea

a
little
lake

the

the

all
the
prisms
all
the
peaks
were
flooded
with
the
electric

so
that
the
brilliancy
belonged
to
them
and
as
if
the
light
issued
from
them
in
the
center
of
the
lake
a
long
cigarshaped
object
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
water
silent
motionless
the
brilliancy
which
issued
from
it
escaped
from
its
sides
as
from
two
kilns
heated
to
a
white
heat
this
apparatus
similar
in
shape
to
an
enormous
whale

about
250

rose
about
ten
or
twelve
above

slowly
approached

up
in
the
bows

gazed
a
prey
to
violent
excitement

all
at
once
seizing
the
reporters

it
is

it
can
only
be
he
he
cried
he
then
falling
back
on
the
seat
he
murmured
a
name
which
gideon
spilett
alone
could
hear
the
reporter
evidently
knew
this
name
for
it
had
a
wonderful
effect
upon
him
and
he
answered
in
a
hoarse
voice
he
an
outlawed
man
he
said
harding
at
the
engineers
command
the
boat
approached
this
singular
floating
apparatus
the
boat
touched
the
left
side
from
which
escaped
a
ray
of
light
through
a
thick
glass
harding
and
his
companions
mounted
on
the
platform
an
open
hatchway

there
all
darted
down
the
opening
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
was
a
deck
lighted
by
electricity
at
the
end
of
this
deck
was
a
door
which
harding
opened
a
richlyornamented
room
quickly
traversed
by
the
colonists

joined
to
a
library
over
which
a
luminous
ceiling
shed
a
flood
of
light
at
the
end
of
the
library
a
large
door
also
shut
was
opened
by
the
engineer
an
immense
saloona

before
the
eyes
of
the

who
almost
thought
themselves
suddenly
transported
into
a
land
of
enchantment
stretched
on
a
rich
sofa
they
saw
a
man
who
did
not
appear
to
notice
their
presence
then
harding
raised
his
voice
and
to
the
extreme
surprise
of
his
companions
he
uttered
these
words
captain

you
asked
for
us
we
are

chapter

at
these
words
the
reclining
figure
rose
and
the
electric
light
fell
upon
his
countenance
a
magnificent
head
the
forehead
high
the
glance
commanding
beard
white
hair
abundant
and
falling
over
the
shoulders
his
hand
rested
upon
the
cushion
of
the
divan
from
which
he
had
just
risen
he
appeared
perfectly
calm
it
was
evident
that
his
strength
had
been
gradually
undermined
by
illness
but
his
voice
seemed
yet
powerful
as
he
said
in
english
and
in
a
tone
which
evinced
extreme
surprise
sir
i
have
no
name
nevertheless
i
know
you
replied
cyrus
harding
captain
nemo
fixed
his
penetrating
gaze
upon
the
engineer
as
though
he
were
about
to
annihilate
him
then
falling
back
amid
the
pillows
of
the
divan
after
all
what
matters
now
he
murmured
i
am
dying
cyrus
harding
drew
near
the
captain
and

took

ayrton
pencroft

and

stood
respectfully
apart
in
an
angle
of
the
magnificent
saloon
whose
atmosphere
was
saturated
with
the
electric
fluid
meanwhile
captain
nemo
withdrew
his
hand
and
motioned
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
to
be
seated
all
regarded
him
with
profound
emotion
before
them
they
beheld
that
being
whom
they
had
styled
the
genius
of
the
island
the
powerful
protector
whose
intervention
in
so
many
circumstances
had
been
so
efficacious
the
benefactor
to
whom
they
owed
such
a
debt
of
gratitude
their
eyes
beheld
a
man
only
and
a
man
at
the
point
of
death
where
pencroft
and
neb
had
expected
to
find
an
almost
supernatural
being
but
how
happened
it
that
cyrus
harding
had
recognized
captain
nemo
why
had
the
latter
so
suddenly
risen
on
hearing
this
name
uttered
a
name
which
he
had
believed
known
to
none
the
captain
had
resumed
his
position
on
the
divan
and
leaning
on
his
arm
he
regarded
the
engineer
seated
near
him
you
know
the
name
i
formerly
bore
sir
he
asked
i
do
answered
cyrus
harding
and
also
that
of
this
wonderful
submarine
vessel
the
nautilus
said
the
captain
with
a
faint
smile
the
nautilus
but
do
youdo
you
know
who
i
am
i
do
it
is
nevertheless
many
years
since
i
have
held
any
communication
with
the
inhabited
world
three
long
years
have
i
passed
in
the
depth
of
the
sea
the
only
place
where
i
have
found
liberty
who
then
can
have
betrayed
my
secret
a
man
who
was
bound
to
you
by
no
tie
captain
nemo
and
who
consequently
cannot
be
accused
of
treachery
the
frenchman
who
was
cast
on
board
my
vessel
by
chance
sixteen
years
since
the
same
he
and
his
two
companions
did
not
then
perish
in
the
maelstrom
in
the
midst
of
which
the
nautilus
was
struggling
they
escaped
and
a
book
has
appeared
under
the
title
of
twenty
thousand
leagues
under
the
sea
which
contains
your
history
the
history
of
a
few
months
only
of
my
life
interrupted
the
captain
impetuously
it
is
true
answered
cyrus
harding
but
a
few
months
of
that
strange
life
have
sufficed
to
make
you
known
as
a
great
criminal
doubtless
said
captain
nemo
a
haughty
smile
curling
his
lips
yes
a
rebel
perhaps
an
outlaw
against
humanity
the
engineer
was
silent
well
sir
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
you
captain
nemo
answered
cyrus
harding
at
any
rate
as
regards
your
past
life
i
am
with
the
rest
of
the
world
ignorant
of
the
motives
which
induced
you
to
adopt
this
strange
mode
of
existence
and
i
cannot
judge
of
effects
without
knowing
their
causes
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
a
beneficent
hand
has
constantly
protected
us
since
our
arrival
on
lincoln
island
that
we
all
owe
our
lives
to
a
good
generous
and
powerful
being
and
that
this
being
so
powerful
good
and
generous
captain
nemo
is
yourself
it
is
i
answered
the
captain
simply
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
rose
their
companions
had
drawn
near
and
the
gratitude
with
which
their
hearts
were
charged
was
about
to
express
itself
in
their
gestures
and
words
captain
nemo
stopped
them
by
a
sign
and
in
a
voice
which
betrayed
more
emotion
than
he
doubtless
intended
to
show
wait
till
you
have
heard
all
he
said
and
the
captain
in
a
few
concise
sentences
ran
over
the
events
of
his
life
his
narrative
was
short
yet
he
was
obliged
to
summon
up
his
whole
remaining
energy
to
arrive
at
the
end
he
was
evidently
contending
against
extreme
weakness
several
times
cyrus
harding
entreated
him
to
repose
for
a
while
but
he
shook
his
head
as
a
man
to
whom
the
morrow
may
never
come
and
when
the
reporter
offered
his
assistance
it
is
useless
he
said
my
hours
are
numbered
captain
nemo
was
an
indian

prince
dakkar
son
of
a
rajah
of
the
then
independent
territory

his
father
sent
him
when
ten
years
of
age
to
europe
in
order
that
he
might
receive
an
education
in
all
respects
complete
and
in
the
hopes
that
by
his
talents
and

he
might
one
day
take
a

raising
his

heathen
country
to
a

in

researches
were
extensive

profound
he
traveled
over
the
whole
of

his
rank
and
fortune
caused
him
to
be
everywhere
sought
after
but
the
pleasures
of
the
world
had
for
him
no
attractions
though
young
and
possessed
of
every
personal
advantage
he
was
ever

by
an
unquenchable
thirst
for

that
he
might
become
a

powerful
ruler
of
a
free
and
enlightened
people
still
for
long
the
love
of
science

over
all
other
feelings
he
became
an
artist
deeply
impressed
by
the
marvels
of

a

to
whom
no
one
of

was
unknown

the
policy
of
european
courts
to
the
eyes
of
those
who
observed
him
superficially
he
might
have
passed
for
one
of
those
cosmopolitans
curious
of
knowledge

disdaining

one
of

under
the

1849

married

imbued
with

ardent
than

by
which
he
was
inspired

children
were
born
to
them

they
tenderly
loved

happiness
did
not
prevent
him
from
seeking
to
carry
out
the
object
at
which
he
aimed
he
waited
an
opportunity
at
length
as
he
vainly
fancied

by

warfare

misery
and
had
established
peace

superstition

them
the
facile
tools

designing
chiefs

the
great

broke
out

that
he
should
thereby

the
opportunity

attaining

his

equally
with
the

of
the
wretched
and

fanatics
he
was
ten
times
wounded
in
twenty
engagements
seeking
death
but
finding
it
not
but
at
length
the
sanguinary
rebels
were
utterly
defeated
and
the
atrocious
mutiny
was
brought
to
an
end
never
before
had
the
british
power
in

been
exposed
to
such
danger

had
fought
openly

by
disappointment
at
the
destruction
of
all
his
vain
hopes
a
prey
to
profound
disgust
for
all
human

filled
with
hatred

he
realized
the
wreck
of
his
fortune
assembled
some
score
of
his
most
faithful
companions
and
one
day
disappeared
leaving
no
trace
behind
where
then
did
he
seek
that
liberty
denied
him
upon
the
inhabited
earth
under
the
waves
in
the
depths
of
the

follow
the
warrior
became
the
man
of
science
upon
a
deserted
island
of
the
pacific
he
established
his
dockyard
and
there
a
submarine
vessel
was
constructed
from
his
designs
by
methods
which
will
at
some
future
day
be
revealed
he
had
rendered
subservient
the
illimitable
forces
of
electricity
which
extracted
from
inexhaustible
sources
was
employed
for
all
the
requirements
of
his
floating
equipage
as
a
moving
lighting
and
heating

the

with
its
countless
treasures
its
myriads
of

its
numberless
wrecks
its
enormous
mammalia

not
only
all
that
nature
supplied
but
also
all
that
man
had
lost
in
its
depths
sufficed
for
every
want
of
the
prince
and
his
crewand
thus
was
his
most
ardent
desire
accomplished
never
again
to
hold
communication
with
the
earth
he
named
his
submarine
vessel
the
nautilus
called
himself
simply
captain
nemo
and
disappeared
beneath
the
seas
during
many
years
this
strange
being
visited
every
ocean
from
pole
to
pole
outcast
of
the
inhabited
earth
in
these
unknown
worlds
he
gathered
incalculable
treasures
the
millions
lost
in
the
bay
of
vigo
in
1702
by
the
galleons
of
spain
furnished
him
with
a
mine
of
inexhaustible
riches
which
he
devoted
always
anonymously
in
favor
of
those
nations
who
fought
for
the
independence
of
their
country
this
refers
to
the
resurrection
of
the
candiotes
who
were
in
fact
largely
assisted
by
captain
nemo
for
long
however
he
had
held
no
communication
with
his
fellowcreatures
when
during
the
night
of
the
6th
of
november
1866
three
men
were
cast
on
board
his
vessel
they
were
a
french
professor
his
servant
and
a
canadian
fisherman
these
three
men
had
been
hurled
overboard
by
a
collision
which
had
taken
place
between
the
nautilus
and
the
united
states
frigate
abraham
lincoln
which
had
chased
her
captain
nemo
learned
from
this
professor
that
the
nautilus
taken
now
for
a
gigantic
mammal
of
the
whale
species
now
for
a
submarine
vessel
carrying
a
crew
of
pirates
was
sought
for
in
every
sea
he
might
have
returned
these
three
men
to
the
ocean
from
whence
chance
had
brought
them
in
contact
with
his
mysterious
existence
instead
of
doing
this
he
kept
them
prisoners
and
during
seven
months
they
were
enabled
to
behold
all
the
wonders
of
a
voyage
of
twenty
thousand
leagues
under
the
sea
one
day
the
22nd
of
june
1867
these
three
men
who
knew
nothing
of
the
past
history
of
captain
nemo
succeeded
in
escaping
in
one
of
the
nautiluss
boats
but
as
at
this
time
the
nautilus
was
drawn
into
the
vortex
of
the
maelstrom
off
the
coast
of
norway
the
captain
naturally
believed
that
the
fugitives
engulfed
in
that
frightful
whirlpool
found
their
death
at
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
he
was
unaware
that
the
frenchman
and
his
two
companions
had
been
miraculously
cast
on
shore
that
the
fishermen
of
the
lofoten
islands
had
rendered
them
assistance
and
that
the
professor
on
his
return
to
france
had
published
that
work
in
which
seven
months
of
the
strange
and
eventful
navigation
of
the
nautilus
were
narrated
and
exposed
to
the
curiosity
of
the
public
for
a
long
time
after
this
captain
nemo
continued
to
live
thus
traversing
every
sea
but
one
by
one
his
companions
died
and
found
their
last
restingplace
in
their
cemetery
of
coral
in
the
bed
of
the
pacific
at
last
captain
nemo
remained
the
solitary
survivor
of
all
those
who
had
taken
refuge
with
him
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
he
was
now
sixty
years
of
age
although
alone
he
succeeded
in
navigating
the
nautilus
towards
one
of
those
submarine
caverns
which
had
sometimes
served
him
as
a
harbor
one
of
these
ports
was
hollowed
beneath
lincoln
island
and
at
this
moment
furnished
an
asylum
to
the
nautilus
the
captain
had
now
remained
there
six
years
navigating
the
ocean
no
longer
but
awaiting
death
and
that
moment
when
he
should
rejoin
his
former
companions
when
by
chance
he
observed
the
descent
of
the
balloon
which
carried
the
prisoners
of
the
confederates
clad
in
his
diving
dress
he
was
walking
beneath
the
water
at
a
few
cables
length
from
the
shore
of
the
island
when
the
engineer
had
been
thrown
into
the
sea
moved
by
a
feeling
of
compassion
the
captain
saved
cyrus
harding
his
first
impulse
was
to
fly
from
the
vicinity
of
the
five
castaways
but
his
harbor
refuge
was
closed
for
in
consequence
of
an
elevation
of
the
basalt
produced
by
the
influence
of
volcanic
action
he
could
no
longer
pass
through
the
entrance
of
the
vault
though
there
was
sufficient
depth
of
water
to
allow
a
light
craft
to
pass
the
bar
there
was
not
enough
for
the
nautilus
whose
draught
of
water
was
considerable
captain
nemo
was
compelled
therefore
to
remain
he
observed
these
men
thrown
without
resources
upon
a
desert
island
but
had
no
wish
to
be
himself
discovered
by
them
by
degrees
he
became
interested
in
their
efforts
when
he
saw
them
honest
energetic
and
bound
to
each
other
by
the
ties
of
friendship
as
if
despite
his
wishes
he
penetrated
all
the
secrets
of
their
existence
by
means
of
the
diving
dress
he
could
easily
reach
the
well
in
the
interior
of
granite
house
and
climbing
by
the
projections
of
rock
to
its
upper
orifice
he
heard
the
colonists
as
they
recounted
the
past
and
studied
the
present
and
future
he
learned
from
them
the
tremendous
conflict
of
america
with
america
itself
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
yes
these
men
were
worthy
to
reconcile
captain
nemo
with
that
humanity
which
they
represented
so
nobly
in
the
island
captain
nemo
had
saved
cyrus
harding
it
was
he
also
who
had
brought
back
the
dog
to
the
chimneys
who
rescued
top
from
the
waters
of
the
lake
who
caused
to
fall
at
flotsam
point
the
case
containing
so
many
things
useful
to
the
colonists
who
conveyed
the
canoe
back
into
the
stream
of
the
mercy
who
cast
the
cord
from
the
top
of
granite
house
at
the
time
of
the
attack
by
the
baboons
who
made
known
the
presence
of
ayrton
upon
tabor
island
by
means
of
the
document
enclosed
in
the
bottle
who
caused
the
explosion
of
the
brig
by
the
shock
of
a
torpedo
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
canal
who
saved
herbert
from
certain
death
by
bringing
the
sulphate
of
quinine
and
finally
it
was
he
who
had
killed
the
convicts
with
the
electric
balls
of
which
he
possessed
the
secret
and
which
he
employed
in
the
chase
of
submarine
creatures
thus
were
explained
so
many
apparently
supernatural
occurrences
and
which
all
proved
the
generosity
and
power
of
the
captain
nevertheless
this
noble
misanthrope
longed
to
benefit
his
proteges
still
further
there
yet
remained
much
useful
advice
to
give
them
and
his
heart
being
softened
by
the
approach
of
death
he
invited
as
we
are
aware
the
colonists
of
granite
house
to
visit
the
nautilus
by
means
of
a
wire
which
connected
it
with
the
corral
possibly
he
would
not
have
done
this
had
he
been
aware
that
cyrus
harding
was
sufficiently
acquainted
with
his
history
to
address
him
by
the
name
of
nemo
the
captain
concluded
the
narrative
of
his
life
cyrus
harding
then
spoke
he
recalled
all
the
incidents
which
had
exercised
so
beneficent
an
influence
upon
the
colony
and
in
the
names
of
his
companions
and
himself
thanked
the
generous
being
to
whom
they
owed
so
much
but
captain
nemo
paid
little
attention
his
mind
appeared
to
be
absorbed
by
one
idea
and
without
taking
the
proffered
hand
of
the
engineer
now
sir
said
he
now
that
you
know
my
history
your
judgment
in
saying
this
the
captain
evidently
alluded
to
an
important
incident
witnessed
by
the
three
strangers
thrown
on
board
his
vessel
and
which
the
french
professor
had
related
in
his
work
causing
a
profound
and
terrible
sensation
some
days
previous
to
the
flight
of
the
professor
and
his
two
companions
the
nautilus
being
chased
by
a
frigate
in
the
north
of
the
atlantic
had
hurled
herself
as
a
ram
upon
this
frigate
and
sunk
her
without
mercy
cyrus
harding
understood
the
captains
allusion
and
was
silent
it
was
an
enemys
frigate
exclaimed
captain
nemo
transformed
for
an
instant
into
the
prince
dakkar
an
enemys
frigate
it
was
she
who
attacked
mei
was
in
a
narrow
and
shallow
baythe
frigate
barred
my
wayand
i
sank
her
a
few
moments
of
silence
ensued
then
the
captain
demanded
what
think
you
of
my
life
gentlemen
cyrus
harding
extended
his
hand
to
the
cidevant
prince
and
replied
gravely
sir
your
error
was
in
supposing
that
the
past
can
be
resuscitated
and
in
contending
against
inevitable
progress
it
is
one
of
those
errors
which
some
admire
others
blame
which
god
alone
can
judge
he
who
is
mistaken
in
an
action
which
he
sincerely
believes
to
be
right
may
be
an
enemy
but
retains
our
esteem
your
error
is
one
that
we
may
admire
and
your
name
has
nothing
to
fear
from
the
judgment
of
history
which
does
not
condemn
heroic
folly
but
its
results
the
old
mans
breast
swelled
with
emotion
and
raising
his
hand
to
heaven
was
i
wrong
or
in
the
right
he
murmured
cyrus
harding
replied
all
great
actions
return
to
god
from
whom
they
are
derived
captain
nemo
we
whom
you

succored
shall
ever
mourn
your
loss
herbert
who
had
drawn
near
the
captain
fell
on
his
knees

kissed
his
hand
a
tear
glistened
in
the
eyes

day

returned
no
ray
of

into
the
profundity
of
the
cavern
it
being
highwater
the
entrance
was
closed
by
the
sea
but
the
artificial
light
which
escaped
in
long
streams
from
the
skylights
of
the
nautilus
was
as
vivid
as
before
and
the
sheet
of
water
shone
around
the
floating
vessel
an
extreme
exhaustion
now
overcame
captain
nemo
who
had
fallen
back
upon
the
divan
it
was
useless
to
contemplate
removing
him
to
granite
house
for
he
had
expressed
his
wish
to
remain
in
the
midst
of
those
marvels
of
the
nautilus
which
millions
could
not
have
purchased
and
to
wait
there
for
that
death
which
was
swiftly
approaching
during
a
long
interval
of
prostration
which
rendered
him
almost
unconscious
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
attentively
observed
the
condition
of
the
dying
man
it
was
apparent
that
his
strength
was
gradually
diminishing
that
frame
once
so
robust
was
now
but
the
fragile
tenement
of
a
departing
soul
all
of
life
was
concentrated
in
the
heart
and
head
the
engineer
and
reporter
consulted
in
whispers
was
it
possible
to
render
any
aid
to
the
dying
man
might
his
life
if
not
saved
be
prolonged
for
some
days
he
himself
had
said
that
no
remedy
could
avail
and
he
awaited
with
tranquillity
that
death
which
had
for
him
no
terrors
we
can
do
nothing
said
gideon
spilett
but
of
what
is
he
dying
asked
pencroft
life
is
simply
fading
out
replied
the
reporter
nevertheless
said
the
sailor
if
we
move
him
into
the
open
air
and
the
light
of
the
sun
he
might
perhaps
recover
no
pencroft
answered
the
engineer
it
is
useless
to
attempt
it
besides
captain
nemo
would
never
consent
to
leave
his
vessel
he
has
lived
for
a
dozen
years
on
board
the
nautilus
and
on
board
the
nautilus
he
desires
to
die
without
doubt
captain
nemo
heard
cyrus
hardings
reply
for
he
raised
himself
slightly
and
in
a
voice
more
feeble
but
always
intelligible
you
are
right
sir
he
said
i
shall
die
hereit
is
my
wish
and
therefore
i
have
a
request
to
make
of
you
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
had
drawn
near
the
divan
and
now
arranged
the
cushions
in
such
a
manner
as
to
better
support
the
dying
man
they
saw
his
eyes
wander
over
all
the
marvels
of
this
saloon
lighted
by
the
electric
rays
which
fell
from
the
arabesques
of
the
luminous
ceiling
he
surveyed
one
after
the
other
the
pictures
hanging
from
the
splendid
tapestries
of
the
partitions
the
chefdoeuvres
of
the
italian
flemish
french
and
spanish
masters
the
statues
of
marble
and
bronze
on
their
pedestals
the
magnificent
organ
leaning
against
the
afterpartition
the
aquarium
in
which
bloomed
the
most
wonderful
productions
of
the
seamarine
plants
zoophytes
chaplets
of
pearls
of
inestimable
value
and
finally
his
eyes
rested
on
this
device
inscribed
over
the
pediment
of
the
museumthe
motto
of
the
nautilus
mobilis
in
mobile
his
glance
seemed
to
rest
fondly
for
the
last
time
on
these
masterpieces
of
art
and
of
nature
to
which
he
had
limited
his
horizon
during
a
sojourn
of
so
many
years
in
the
abysses
of
the
seas
cyrus
harding
respected
the
captains
silence
and
waited
till
he
should
speak
after
some
minutes
during
which
doubtless
he
passed
in
review
his
whole
life
captain
nemo
turned
to
the
colonists
and
said
you
consider
yourselves
gentlemen
under
some
obligations
to
me
captain
believe
us
that
we
would
give
our
lives
to
prolong
yours
promise
then
continued
captain
nemo
to
carry
out
my
last
wishes
and
i
shall
be
repaid
for
all
i
have
done
for
you
we
promise
said
cyrus
harding
and
by
this
promise
he
bound
both
himself
and
his
companions
gentlemen
resumed
the
captain
tomorrow
i
shall
be
dead
herbert
was
about
to
utter
an
exclamation
but
a
sign
from
the
captain
arrested
him
tomorrow
i
shall
die
and
i
desire
no
other
tomb
than
the
nautilus
it
is
my
grave
all
my
friends
repose
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
their
restingplace
shall
be
mine
these
words
were
received
with
profound
silence
pay
attention
to
my
wishes
he
continued
the
nautilus
is
imprisoned
in
this
grotto
the
entrance
of
which
is
blocked
up
but
although
egress
is
impossible
the
vessel
may
at
least
sink
in
the
abyss
and
there
bury
my
remains
the
colonists
listened
reverently
to
the
words
of
the
dying
man
tomorrow
after
my
death
mr
harding
continued
the
captain
yourself
and
companions
will
leave
the
nautilus
for
all
the
treasures
it
contains
must
perish
with
me
one
token
alone
will
remain
with
you
of
prince
dakkar
with
whose
history
you
are
now
acquainted
that
coffer
yonder
contains
diamonds
of
the
value
of
many
millions
most
of
them
mementoes
of
the
time
when
husband
and
father
i
thought
happiness
possible
for
me
and
a
collection
of
pearls
gathered
by
my
friends
and
myself
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
of
this
treasure
at
a
future
day
you
may
make
good
use
in
the
hands
of
such
men
as
yourself
and
your
comrades
captain
harding
money
will
never
be
a
source
of
danger
from
on
high
i
shall
still
participate
in
your
enterprises
and
i
fear
not
but
that
they
will
prosper
after
a
few
moments
repose
necessitated
by
his
extreme
weakness
captain
nemo
continued
tomorrow
you
will
take
the
coffer
you
will
leave
the
saloon
of
which
you
will
close
the
door
then
you
will
ascend
on
to
the
deck
of
the
nautilus
and
you
will
lower
the
mainhatch
so
as
entirely
to
close
the
vessel
it
shall
be
done
captain
answered
cyrus
harding
good
you
will
then
embark
in
the
canoe
which
brought
you
hither
but
before
leaving
the
nautilus
go
to
the
stern
and
there
open
two
large
stopcocks
which
you
will
find
upon
the
waterline
the
water
will
penetrate
into
the
reservoirs
and
the
nautilus
will
gradually
sink
beneath
the
water
to
repose
at
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
and
comprehending
a
gesture
of
cyrus
harding
the
captain
added
fear
nothing
you
will
but
bury
a
corpse
neither
cyrus
harding
nor
his
companions
ventured
to
offer
any
observation
to
captain
nemo
he
had
expressed
his
last
wishes
and
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
conform
to
them
i
have
your
promise
gentlemen
added
captain
nemo
you
have
captain
replied
the
engineer
the
captain
thanked
the
colonists
by
a
sign
and
requested
them
to
leave
him
for
some
hours
gideon
spilett
wished
to
remain
near
him
in
the
event
of
a
crisis
coming
on
but
the
dying
man
refused
saying
i
shall
live
until
tomorrow
sir
all
left
the
saloon
passed
through
the
library
and
the
diningroom
and
arrived
forward
in
the
machineroom
where
the
electrical
apparatus
was
established
which
supplied
not
only
heat
and
light
but
the
mechanical
power
of
the
nautilus
the
nautilus
was
a
masterpiece
containing
masterpieces
within
itself
and
the
engineer
was
struck
with
astonishment
the
colonists
mounted
the
platform
which
rose
seven
or
eight
feet
above
the
water
there
they
beheld
a
thick
glass
lenticular
covering
which
protected
a
kind
of
large
eye
from
which
flashed
forth
light
behind
this
eye
was
apparently
a
cabin
containing
the
wheels
of
the
rudder
and
in
which
was
stationed
the
helmsman
when
he
navigated
the
nautilus
over
the
bed
of
the
ocean
which
the
electric
rays
would
evidently
light
up
to
a
considerable
distance
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
remained
for
a
time
silent
for
they
were
vividly
impressed
by
what
they
had
just
seen
and
heard
and
their
hearts
were
deeply
touched
by
the
thought
that
he
whose
arm
had
so
often
aided
them
the
protector
whom
they
had
known
but
a
few
hours
was
at
the
point
of
death
whatever
might
be
the
judgment
pronounced
by
posterity
upon
the
events
of
this
so
to
speak
extrahuman
existence
the
character
of
prince
dakkar
would
ever
remain
as
one
of
those
whose
memory
time
can
never
efface
what
a
man
said
pencroft
is
it
possible
that
he
can
have
lived
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
he
has
not
found
peace
there
any
more
than
elsewhere
the
nautilus
observed
ayrton
might
have
enabled
us
to
leave
lincoln
island
and
reach
some
inhabited
country
good
heavens
exclaimed
pencroft
i
for
one
would
never
risk
myself
in
such
a
craft
to
sail
on
the
seas
good
but
under
the
seas
never
i
believe
pencroft
answered
the
reporter
that
the
navigation
of
a
submarine
vessel
such
as
the
nautilus
ought
to
be
very
easy
and
that
we
should
soon
become
accustomed
to
it
there
would
be
no
storms
no
leeshore
to
fear
at
some
feet
beneath
the
surface
the
waters
of
the
ocean
are
as
calm
as
those
of
a
lake
that
may
be
replied
the
sailor
but
i
prefer
a
gale
of
wind
on
board
a
wellfound
craft
a
vessel
is
built
to
sail
on
the
sea
and
not
beneath
it
my
friends
said
the
engineer
it
is
useless
at
any
rate
as
regards
the
nautilus
to
discuss
the
question
of
submarine
vessels
the
nautilus
is
not
ours
and
we
have
not
the
right
to
dispose
of
it
moreover
we
could
in
no
case
avail
ourselves
of
it
independently
of
the
fact
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
it
out
of
this
cavern
whose
entrance
is
now
closed
by
the
uprising
of
the
basaltic
rocks
captain
nemos
wish
is
that
it
shall
be
buried
with
him
his
wish
is
our
law
and
we
will
fulfil
it
after
a
somewhat
prolonged
conversation
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
again
descended
to
the
interior
of
the
nautilus
there
they
took
some
refreshment
and
returned
to
the
saloon
captain
nemo
had
somewhat
rallied
from
the
prostration
which
had
overcome
him
and
his
eyes
shone
with
their
wonted
fire
a
faint
smile
even
curled
his
lips
the
colonists
drew
around
him
gentlemen
said
the
captain
you
are
brave
and
honest
men
you
have
devoted
yourselves
to
the
common
weal
often
have
i
observed
your
conduct
i
have
esteemed
youi
esteem
you
still
your
hand
mr
harding
cyrus
harding
gave
his
hand
to
the
captain
who
clasped
it
affectionately
it
is
well
he
murmured
he
resumed
but
enough
of
myself
i
have
to
speak
concerning
yourselves
and
this
lincoln
island
upon
which
you
have
taken
refuge
you
now
desire
to
leave
it
to
return
captain
answered
pencroft
quickly
to
return
pencroft
said
the
captain
with
a
smile
i
know
it
is
true
your
love
for
this
island
you
have
helped
to
make
it
what
it
now
is
and
it
seems
to
you
a
paradise
our
project
captain
interposed
cyrus
harding
is
to
annex
it
to
the
united
states
and
to
establish
for
our
shipping
a
port
so
fortunately
situated
in
this
part
of
the
pacific
your
thoughts
are
with
your
country
gentlemen
continued
the
captain
your
toils
are
for
her
prosperity
and
glory
you
are
right
ones
native
landthere
should
one
live
there
die
and
i
die
far
from
all
i
loved
you
have
some
last
wish
to
transmit
said
the
engineer
with
emotion
some
souvenir
to
send
to
those
friends
you
have
left
in
the
mountains
of
india
no
captain
harding
no
friends
remain
to
me
i
am
the
last
of
my
race
and
to
all
whom
i
have
known
i
have
long
been
as
are
the
deadbut
to
return
to
yourselves
solitude
isolation
are
painful
things
and
beyond
human
endurance
i
die
of
having
thought
it
possible
to
live
alone
you
should
therefore
dare
all
in
the
attempt
to
leave
lincoln
island
and
see
once
more
the
land
of
your
birth
i
am
aware
that
those
wretches
have
destroyed
the
vessel
you
have
built
we
propose
to
construct
a
vessel
said
gideon
spilett
sufficiently
large
to
convey
us
to
the
nearest
land
but
if
we
should
succeed
sooner
or
later
we
shall
return
to
lincoln
island
we
are
attached
to
it
by
too
many
recollections
ever
to
forget
it
it
is
here
that
we
have
known
captain
nemo
said
cyrus
harding
it
is
here
only
that
we
can
make
our
home
added
herbert
and
here
shall
i
sleep
the
sleep
of
eternity
if
replied
the
captain
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
instead
of
completing
the
sentence
said
simply
mr
harding
i
wish
to
speak
with
youalone
the
engineers
companions
respecting
the
wish
retired
cyrus
harding
remained
but
a
few
minutes
alone
with
captain
nemo
and
soon
recalled
his
companions
but
he
said
nothing
to
them
of
the
private
matters
which
the
dying
man
had
confided
to
him
gideon
spilett
now
watched
the
captain
with
extreme
care
it
was
evident
that
he
was
no
longer
sustained
by
his
moral
energy
which
had
lost
the
power
of
reaction
against
his
physical
weakness
the
day
closed
without
change
the
colonists
did
not
quit
the
nautilus
for
a
moment
night
arrived
although
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
it
from
day
in
the
cavern
captain
nemo
suffered
no
pain
but
he
was
visibly
sinking
his
noble
features
paled
by
the
approach
of
death
were
perfectly
calm
inaudible
words
escaped
at
intervals
from
his
lips
bearing
upon
various
incidents
of
his
checkered
career
life
was
evidently
ebbing
slowly
and
his
extremities
were
already
cold
once
or
twice
more
he
spoke
to
the
colonists
who
stood
around
him
and
smiled
on
them
with
that
last
smile
which
continues
after
death
at
length
shortly
after
midnight
captain
nemo
by
a
supreme
effort
succeeded
in
folding
his
arms
across
his
breast
as
if
wishing
in
that
attitude
to
compose
himself
for
death
by
one
oclock
his
glance
alone
showed
signs
of
life
a
dying
light
gleamed
in
those
eyes
once
so
brilliant
then
murmuring
the
words
god
and
my
country
he
quietly
expired
cyrus

bending
low
closed
the
eyes
of
him
who
had
once
been
the
prince
dakkar
and
was
now
not
even

nemo
herbert
and
pencroft
sobbed
aloud

neb
was
on

by

motionless
as
a
statue
then
cyrus
harding
extending
his
hand
over
the
forehead
of
the
dead
said
solemnly
may
his
soul
be
with
god
turning
to
his
friends
he
added
let
us
pray
for
him
whom
we
have
lost
some
hours
later
the
colonists
fulfilled
the
promise
made
to
the
captain
by
carrying
out
his
dying
wishes
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
quitted
the
nautilus
taking
with
them
the
only
memento
left
them
by
their
benefactor
the
coffer
which
contained
wealth
amounting
to
millions
the
marvelous
saloon
still
flooded
with
light
had
been
carefully
closed
the
iron
door
leading
on
deck
was
then
securely
fastened
in
such
a
manner
as
to
prevent
even
a
drop
of
water
from
penetrating
to
the
interior
of
the
nautilus
the
colonists
then
descended
into
the
canoe
which
was
moored
to
the
side
of
the
submarine
vessel
the
canoe
was
now
brought
around
to
the
stern
there
at
the
waterline
were
two
large
stopcocks
communicating
with
the
reservoirs
employed
in
the
submersion
of
the
vessel
the
stopcocks
were
opened
the
reservoirs
filled
and
the
nautilus
slowly
sinking
disappeared
beneath
the
surface
of
the
lake
but
the
colonists
were
yet
able
to
follow
its
descent
through
the
waves
the
powerful
light
it
gave
forth
lighted
up
the
translucent
water
while
the
cavern
became
gradually
obscure
at
length
this
vast
effusion
of
electric
light
faded
away
and
soon
after
the
nautilus
now
the
tomb
of
captain
nemo
reposed
in
its
ocean
bed
chapter
18
at
break
of
day
the
colonists
regained
in
silence
the
entrance
of
the
cavern
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
dakkar
grotto
in
memory
of
captain
nemo
it
was
now
lowwater
and
they
passed
without
difficulty
under
the
arcade
washed
on
the
right
by
the
sea
the
canoe
was
left
here
carefully
protected
from
the
waves
as
additional
precaution
pencroft
neb
and
ayrton
drew
it
up
on
a
little
beach
which
bordered
one
of
the
sides
of
the
grotto
in
a
spot
where
it
could
run
no
risk
of
harm
the
storm
had
ceased
during
the
night
the
last
low
mutterings
of
the
thunder
died
away
in
the
west
rain
fell
no
longer
but
the
sky
was
yet
obscured
by
clouds
on
the
whole
this
month
of
october
the
first
of
the
southern
spring
was
not
ushered
in
by
satisfactory
tokens
and
the
wind
had
a
tendency
to
shift
from
one
point
of
the
compass
to
another
which
rendered
it
impossible
to
count
upon
settled
weather
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
on
leaving
dakkar
grotto
had
taken
the
road
to
the
corral
on
their
way
neb
and
herbert
were
careful
to
preserve
the
wire
which
had
been
laid
down
by
the
captain
between
the
corral
and
the
grotto
and
which
might
at
a
future
time
be
of
service
the
colonists
spoke
but
little
on
the
road
the
various
incidents
of
the
night
of
october
15th
had
left
a
profound
impression
on
their
minds
the
unknown
being
whose
influence
had
so
effectually
protected
them
the
man
whom
their
imagination
had
endowed
with
supernatural
powers
captain
nemo
was
no
more
his
nautilus
and
he
were
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
abyss
to
each
one
of
them
their
existence
seemed
even
more
isolated
than
before
they
had
been
accustomed
to
count
upon
the
intervention
of
that
power
which
existed
no
longer
and
gideon
spilett
and
even
cyrus
harding
could
not
escape
this
impression
thus
they
maintained
a
profound
silence
during
their
journey
to
the
corral
towards
nine
in
the
morning
the
colonists
arrived
at
granite
house
it
had
been
agreed
that
the
construction
of
the
vessel
should
be
actively
pushed
forward
and
cyrus
harding
more
than
ever
devoted
his
time
and
labor
to
this
object
it
was
impossible
to
divine
what
future
lay
before
them
evidently
the
advantage
to
the
colonists
would
be
great
of
having
at
their
disposal
a
substantial
vessel
capable
of
keeping
the
sea
even
in
heavy
weather
and
large
enough
to
attempt
in
case
of
need
a
voyage
of
some
duration
even
if
when
their
vessel
should
be
completed
the
colonists
should
not
resolve
to
leave
lincoln
island
as
yet
in
order
to
gain
either
one
of
the
polynesian
archipelagoes
of
the
pacific
or
the
shores
of
new
zealand
they
might
at
least
sooner
or
later
proceed
to
tabor
island
to
leave
there
the
notice
relating
to
ayrton
this
was
a
precaution
rendered
indispensable
by
the
possibility
of
the
scotch
yacht
reappearing
in
those
seas
and
it
was
of
the
highest
importance
that
nothing
should
be
neglected
on
this
point
the
works
were
then
resumed
cyrus
harding
pencroft
and
ayrton
assisted
by
neb
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
except
when
unavoidably
called
off
by
other
necessary
occupations
worked
without
cessation
it
was
important
that
the
new
vessel
should
be
ready
in
five
monthsthat
is
to
say
by
the
beginning
of
marchif
they
wished
to
visit
tabor
island
before
the
equinoctial
gales
rendered
the
voyage
impracticable
therefore
the
carpenters
lost
not
a
moment
moreover
it
was
unnecessary
to
manufacture
rigging
that
of
the
speedy
having
been
saved
entire
so
that
the
hull
only
of
the
vessel
needed
to
be
constructed
the
end
of
the
year
1868
found
them
occupied
by
these
important
labors
to
the
exclusion
of
almost
all
others
at
the
expiration
of
two
months
and
a
half
the
ribs
had
been
set
up
and
the
first
planks
adjusted
it
was
already
evident
that
the
plans
made
by
cyrus
harding
were
admirable
and
that
the
vessel
would
behave
well
at
sea
pencroft
brought
to
the
task
a
devouring
energy
and
would
even
grumble
when
one
or
the
other
abandoned
the
carpenters
axe
for
the
gun
of
the
hunter
it
was
nevertheless
necessary
to
keep
up
the
stores
of
granite
house
in
view
of
the
approaching
winter
but
this
did
not
satisfy
pencroft
the
brave
honest
sailor
was
not
content
when
the
workmen
were
not
at
the
dockyard
when
this
happened
he
grumbled
vigorously
and
by
way
of
venting
his
feelings
did
the
work
of
six
men
the
weather
was
very
unfavorable
during
the
whole
of
the
summer
season
for
some
days
the
heat
was
overpowering
and
the
atmosphere
saturated
with
electricity
was
only
cleared
by
violent
storms
it
was
rarely
that
the
distant
growling
of
the
thunder
could
not
be
heard
like
a
low
but
incessant
murmur
such
as
is
produced
in
the
equatorial
regions
of
the
globe
the
1st
of
january
1869
was
signalized
by
a
storm
of
extreme
violence
and
the
thunder
burst
several
times
over
the
island
large
trees
were
struck
by
the
electric
fluid
and
shattered
and
among
others
one
of
those
gigantic
nettletrees
which
had
shaded
the
poultryyard
at
the
southern
extremity
of
the
lake
had
this
meteor
any
relation
to
the
phenomena
going
on
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
was
there
any
connection
between
the
commotion
of
the
atmosphere
and
that
of
the
interior
of
the
earth
cyrus
harding
was
inclined
to
think
that
such
was
the
case
for
the
development
of
these
storms
was
attended
by
the
renewal
of
volcanic
symptoms
it
was
on
the
3rd
of
january
that
herbert
having
ascended
at
daybreak
to
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
to
harness
one
of
the
onagers
perceived
an
enormous
hatshaped
cloud
rolling
from
the
summit
of
the
volcano
herbert
immediately
apprised
the
colonists
who
at
once
joined
him
in
watching
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
ah
exclaimed
pencroft
those
are
not
vapors
this
time
it
seems
to
me
that
the
giant
is
not
content
with
breathing
he
must
smoke
this
figure
of
speech
employed
by
the
sailor
exactly
expressed
the
changes
going
on
at
the
mouth
of
the
volcano
already
for
three
months
had
the
crater
emitted
vapors
more
or
less
dense
but
which
were
as
yet
produced
only
by
an
internal
ebullition
of
mineral
substances
but
now
the
vapors
were
replaced
by
a
thick
smoke
rising
in
the
form
of
a
grayish
column
more
than
three
hundred
feet
in
width
at
its
base
and
which
spread
like
an
immense
mushroom
to
a
height
of
from
seven
to
eight
hundred
feet
above
the
summit
of
the
mountain
the
fire
is
in
the
chimney
observed
gideon
spilett
and
we
cant
put
it
out
replied
herbert
the
volcano
ought
to
be
swept
observed
neb
who
spoke
as
if
perfectly
serious
well
said
neb
cried
pencroft
with
a
shout
of
laughter
and
youll
undertake
the
job
no
doubt
cyrus
harding
attentively
observed
the
dense
smoke
emitted
by
mount
franklin
and
even
listened
as
if
expecting
to
hear
some
distant
muttering
then
turning
towards
his
companions
from
whom
he
had
gone
somewhat
apart
he
said
the
truth
is
my
friends
we
must
not
conceal
from
ourselves
that
an
important
change
is
going
forward
the
volcanic
substances
are
no
longer
in
a
state
of
ebullition
they
have
caught
fire
and
we
are
undoubtedly
menaced
by
an
approaching
eruption
well
captain
said
pencroft
we
shall
witness
the
eruption
and
if
it
is
a
good
one
well
applaud
it
i
dont
see
that
we
need
concern
ourselves
further
about
the
matter
it
may
be
so
replied
cyrus
harding
for
the
ancient
track
of
the
lava
is
still
open
and
thanks
to
this
the
crater
has
hitherto
overflowed
towards
the
north
and
yet
and
yet
as
we
can
derive
no
advantage
from
an
eruption
it
might
be
better
it
should
not
take
place
said
the
reporter
who
knows
answered
the
sailor
perhaps
there
may
be
some
valuable
substance
in
this
volcano
which
it
will
spout
forth
and
which
we
may
turn
to
good
account
cyrus
harding
shook
his
head
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
augured
no
good
from
the
phenomenon
whose
development
had
been
so
sudden
he
did
not
regard
so
lightly
as
pencroft
the
results
of
an
eruption
if
the
lava
in
consequence
of
the
position
of
the
crater
did
not
directly
menace
the
wooded
and
cultivated
parts
of
the
island
other
complications
might
present
themselves
in
fact
eruptions
are
not
unfrequently
accompanied
by
earthquakes
and
an
island
of
the
nature
of
lincoln
island
formed
of
substances
so
varied
basalt
on
one
side
granite
on
the
other
lava
on
the
north
rich
soil
on
the
south
substances
which
consequently
could
not
be
firmly
attached
to
each
other
would
be
exposed
to
the
risk
of
disintegration
although
therefore
the
spreading
of
the
volcanic
matter
might
not
constitute
a
serious
danger
any
movement
of
the
terrestrial
structure
which
should
shake
the
island
might
entail
the
gravest
consequences
it
seems
to
me
said
ayrton
who
had
reclined
so
as
to
place
his
ear
to
the
ground
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
hear
a
dull
rumbling
sound
like
that
of
a
wagon
loaded
with
bars
of
iron
the
colonists
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
and
were
convinced
that
ayrton
was
not
mistaken
the
rumbling
was
mingled
with
a
subterranean
roar
which
formed
a
sort
of
rinforzando
and
died
slowly
away
as
if
some
violent
storm
had
passed
through
the
profundities
of
the
globe
but
no
explosion
properly
so
termed
could
be
heard
it
might
therefore
be
concluded
that
the
vapors
and
smoke
found
a
free
passage
through
the
central
shaft
and
that
the
safetyvalve
being
sufficiently
large
no
convulsion
would
be
produced
no
explosion
was
to
be
apprehended
well
then
said
pencroft
are
we
not
going
back
to
work
let
mount
franklin
smoke
groan
bellow
or
spout
forth
fire
and
flame
as
much
as
it
pleases
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
be
idle
come
ayrton
neb
herbert
captain
harding
mr
spilett
every
one
of
us
must
turn
to
at
our
work
today
we
are
going
to
place
the
keelson
and
a
dozen
pair
of
hands
would
not
be
too
many
before
two
months
i
want
our
new
bonadventurefor
we
shall
keep
the
old
name
shall
we
notto
float
on
the
waters
of
port
balloon
therefore
there
is
not
an
hour
to
lose
all
the
colonists
their
services
thus
requisitioned
by
pencroft
descended
to
the
dockyard
and
proceeded
to
place
the
keelson
a
thick
mass
of
wood
which
forms
the
lower
portion
of
a
ship
and
unites
firmly
the
timbers
of
the
hull
it
was
an
arduous
undertaking
in
which
all
took
part
they
continued
their
labors
during
the
whole
of
this
day
the
3rd
of
january
without
thinking
further
of
the
volcano
which
could
not
besides
be
seen
from
the
shore
of
granite
house
but
once
or
twice
large
shadows
veiling
the
sun
which
described
its
diurnal
arc
through
an
extremely
clear
sky
indicated
that
a
thick
cloud
of
smoke
passed
between
its
disc
and
the
island
the
wind
blowing
on
the
shore
carried
all
these
vapors
to
the
westward
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
remarked
these
somber
appearances
and
from
time
to
time
discussed
the
evident
progress
of
the
volcanic
phenomena
but
their
work
went
on
without
interruption
it
was
besides
of
the
first
importance
from
every
point
of
view
that
the
vessel
should
be
finished
with
the
least
possible
delay
in
presence
of
the
eventualities
which
might
arise
the
safety
of
the
colonists
would
be
to
a
great
extent
secured
by
their
ship
who
could
tell
that
it
might
not
prove
some
day
their
only
refuge
in
the
evening
after
supper
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
again
ascended
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
it
was
already
dark
and
the
obscurity
would
permit
them
to
ascertain
if
flames
or
incandescent
matter
thrown
up
by
the
volcano
were
mingled
with
the
vapor
and
smoke
accumulated
at
the
mouth
of
the
crater
the
crater
is
on
fire
said
herbert
who
more
active
than
his
companion
first
reached
the
plateau
mount
franklin
distant
about
six
miles
now
appeared
like
a
gigantic
torch
around
the
summit
of
which
turned
fuliginous
flames
so
much
smoke
and
possibly
scoriae
and
cinders
were
mingled
with
them
that
their
light
gleamed
but
faintly
amid
the
gloom
of
the
night
but
a
kind
of
lurid
brilliancy
spread
over
the
island
against
which
stood
out
confusedly
the
wooded
masses
of
the
heights
immense
whirlwinds
of
vapor
obscured
the
sky
through
which
glimmered
a
few
stars
the
change
is
rapid
said
the
engineer
that
is
not
surprising
answered
the
reporter
the
reawakening
of
the
volcano
already
dates
back
some
time
you
may
remember
cyrus
that
the
first
vapors
appeared
about
the
time
we
searched
the
sides
of
the
mountain
to
discover
captain
nemos
retreat
it
was
if
i
mistake
not
about
the
15th
of
october
yes
replied
herbert
two
months
and
a
half
ago
the
subterranean
fires
have
therefore
been
smoldering
for
ten
weeks
resumed
gideon
spilett
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
they
now
break
out
with
such
violence
do
not
you
feel
a
certain
vibration
of
the
soil
asked
cyrus
harding
yes
replied
gideon
spilett
but
there
is
a
great
difference
between
that
and
an
earthquake
i
do
not
affirm
that
we
are
menaced
with
an
earthquake
answered
cyrus
harding
may
god
preserve
us
from
that
no
these
vibrations
are
due
to
the
effervescence
of
the
central
fire
the
crust
of
the
earth
is
simply
the
shell
of
a
boiler
and
you
know
that
such
a
shell
under
the
pressure
of
steam
vibrates
like
a
sonorous
plate
it
is
this
effect
which
is
being
produced
at
this
moment
what
magnificent
flames
exclaimed
herbert
at
this
instant
a
kind
of
bouquet
of
flames
shot
forth
from
the
crater
the
brilliancy
of
which
was
visible
even
through
the
vapors
thousands
of
luminous
sheets
and
barbed
tongues
of
fire
were
cast
in
various
directions
some
extending
beyond
the
dome
of
smoke
dissipated
it
leaving
behind
an
incandescent
powder
this
was
accompanied
by
successive
explosions
resembling
the
discharge
of
a
battery
of
machineguns
cyrus
harding
the
reporter
and
herbert
after
spending
an
hour
on
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
again
descended
to
the
beach
and
returned
to
granite
house
the
engineer
was
thoughtful
and
preoccupied
so
much
so
indeed
that
gideon
spilett
inquired
if
he
apprehended
any
immediate
danger
of
which
the
eruption
might
directly
or
indirectly
be
the
cause
yes
and
no
answered
cyrus
harding
nevertheless
continued
the
reporter
would
not
the
greatest
misfortune
which
could
happen
to
us
be
an
earthquake
which
would
overturn
the
island
now
i
do
not
suppose
that
this
is
to
be
feared
since
the
vapors
and
lava
have
found
a
free
outlet
true
replied
cyrus
harding
and
i
do
not
fear
an
earthquake
in
the
sense
in
which
the
term
is
commonly
applied
to
convulsions
of
the
soil
provoked
by
the
expansion
of
subterranean
gases
but
other
causes
may
produce
great
disasters
how
so
my
dear
cyrus
i
am
not
certain
i
must
consider
i
must
visit
the
mountain
in
a
few
days
i
shall
learn
more
on
this
point
gideon
spilett
said
no
more
and
soon
in
spite
of
the
explosions
of
the
volcano
whose
intensity
increased
and
which
were
repeated
by
the
echoes
of
the
island
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
were
sleeping
soundly
three
days
passed
bythe
4th
5th
and
6th
of
january
the
construction
of
the
vessel
was
diligently
continued
and
without
offering
further
explanations
the
engineer
pushed
forward
the
work
with
all
his
energy
mount
franklin
was
now
hooded
by
a
somber
cloud
of
sinister
aspect
and
amid
the
flames
vomiting
forth
incandescent
rocks
some
of
which
fell
back
into
the
crater
itself
this
caused
pencroft
who
would
only
look
at
the
matter
in
the
light
of
a
joke
to
exclaim
ah
the
giant
is
playing
at
cup
and
ball
he
is
a
conjurer
in
fact
the
substances
thrown
up
fell
back
again
in
to
the
abyss
and
it
did
not
seem
that
the
lava
though
swollen
by
the
internal
pressure
had
yet
risen
to
the
orifice
of
the
crater
at
any
rate
the
opening
on
the
northeast
which
was
partly
visible
poured
out
no
torrent
upon
the
northern
slope
of
the
mountain
nevertheless
however
pressing
was
the
construction
of
the
vessel
other
duties
demanded
the
presence
of
the
colonists
on
various
portions
of
the
island
before
everything
it
was
necessary
to
go
to
the
corral
where
the
flocks
of
musmons
and
goats
were
enclosed
and
replenish
the
provision
of
forage
for
those
animals
it
was
accordingly
arranged
that
ayrton
should
proceed
thither
the
next
day
the
7th
of
january
and
as
he
was
sufficient
for
the
task
to
which
he
was
accustomed
pencroft
and
the
rest
were
somewhat
surprised
on
hearing
the
engineer
say
to
ayrton
as
you
are
going
tomorrow
to
the
corral
i
will
accompany
you
but
captain
harding
exclaimed
the
sailor
our
working
days
will
not
be
many
and
if
you
go
also
we
shall
be
two
pair
of
hands
short
we
shall
return
tomorrow
replied
cyrus
harding
but
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
go
to
the
corral
i
must
learn
how
the
eruption
is
progressing
the
eruption
always
the
eruption
answered
pencroft
with
an
air
of
discontent
an
important
thing
truly
this
eruption
i
trouble
myself
very
little
about
it
whatever
might
be
the
sailors
opinion
the
expedition
projected
by
the
engineer
was
settled
for
the
next
day
herbert
wished
to
accompany
cyrus
harding
but
he
would
not
vex
pencroft
by
his
absence
the
next
day
at
dawn
cyrus
harding
and
ayrton
mounting
the
cart
drawn
by
two
onagers
took
the
road
to
the
corral
and
set
off
at
a
round
trot
above
the
forest
were
passing
large
clouds
to
which
the
crater
of
mount
franklin
incessantly
added
fuliginous
matter
these
clouds
which
rolled
heavily
in
the
air
were
evidently
composed
of
heterogeneous
substances
it
was
not
alone
from
the
volcano
that
they
derived
their
strange
opacity
and
weight
scoriae
in
a
state
of
dust
like
powdered
pumicestone
and
grayish
ashes
as
small
as
the
finest
feculae
were
held
in
suspension
in
the
midst
of
their
thick
folds
these
ashes
are
so
fine
that
they
have
been
observed
in
the
air
for
whole
months
after
the
eruption
of
1783
in
iceland
for
upwards
of
a
year
the
atmosphere
was
thus
charged
with
volcanic
dust
through
which
the
rays
of
the
sun
were
only
with
difficulty
discernible
but
more
often
this
pulverized
matter
falls
and
this
happened
on
the
present
occasion
cyrus
harding
and
ayrton
had
scarcely
reached
the
corral
when
a
sort
of
black
snow
like
fine
gunpowder
fell
and
instantly
changed
the
appearance
of
the
soil
trees
meadows
all
disappeared
beneath
a
covering
several
inches
in
depth
but
very
fortunately
the
wind
blew
from
the
northeast
and
the
greater
part
of
the
cloud
dissolved
itself
over
the
sea
this
is
very
singular
captain
harding
said
ayrton
it
is
very
serious
replied
the
engineer
this
powdered
pumicestone
all
this
mineral
dust
proves
how
grave
is
the
convulsion
going
forward
in
the
lower
depths
of
the
volcano
but
can
nothing
be
done
nothing
except
to
note
the
progress
of
the
phenomenon
do
you
therefore
ayrton
occupy
yourself
with
the
necessary
work
at
the
corral
in
the
meantime
i
will
ascend
just
beyond
the
source
of
red
creek
and
examine
the
condition
of
the
mountain
upon
its
northern
aspect
then
well
captain
harding
then
we
will
pay
a
visit
to
dakkar
grotto
i
wish
to
inspect
it
at
any
rate
i
will
come
back
for
you
in
two
hours
ayrton
then
proceeded
to
enter
the
corral
and
while
awaiting
the
engineers
return
busied
himself
with
the
musmons
and
goats
which
seemed
to
feel
a
certain
uneasiness
in
presence
of
these
first
signs
of
an
eruption
meanwhile
cyrus
harding
ascended
the
crest
of
the
eastern
spur
passed
red
creek
and
arrived
at
the
spot
where
he
and
his
companions
had
discovered
a
sulphurous
spring
at
the
time
of
their
first
exploration
how
changed
was
everything
instead
of
a
single
column
of
smoke
he
counted
thirteen
forced
through
the
soil
as
if
violently
propelled
by
some
piston
it
was
evident
that
the
crust
of
the
earth
was
subjected
in
this
part
of
the
globe
to
a
frightful
pressure
the
atmosphere
was
saturated
with
gases
and
carbonic
acid
mingled
with
aqueous
vapors
cyrus
harding
felt
the
volcanic
tufa
with
which
the
plain
was
strewn
and
which
was
but
pulverized
cinders
hardened
into
solid
blocks
by
time
tremble
beneath
him
but
he
could
discover
no
traces
of
fresh
lava
the
engineer
became
more
assured
of
this
when
he
observed
all
the
northern
part
of
mount
franklin
pillars
of
smoke
and
flame
escaped
from
the
crater
a
hail
of
scoriae
fell
on
the
ground
but
no
current
of
lava
burst
from
the
mouth
of
the
volcano
which
proved
that
the
volcanic
matter
had
not
yet
attained
the
level
of
the
superior
orifice
of
the
central
shaft
but
i
would
prefer
that
it
were
so
said
cyrus
harding
to
himself
at
any
rate
i
should
then
know
that
the
lava
had
followed
its
accustomed
track
who
can
say
that
it
may
not
take
a
new
course
but
the
danger
does
not
consist
in
that
captain
nemo
foresaw
it
clearly
no
the
danger
does
not
lie
there
cyrus
harding
advanced
towards
the
enormous
causeway
whose
prolongation
enclosed
the
narrow
shark
gulf
he
could
now
sufficiently
examine
on
this
side
the
ancient
channels
of
the
lava
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
the
most
recent
eruption
had
occurred
at
a
fardistant
epoch
he
then
returned
by
the
same
way
listening
attentively
to
the
subterranean
mutterings
which
rolled
like
longcontinued
thunder
interrupted
by
deafening
explosions
at
nine
in
the
morning
he
reached
the
corral
ayrton
awaited
him
the
animals
are
cared
for
captain
harding
said
ayrton
good
ayrton
they
seem
uneasy
captain
harding
yes
instinct
speaks
through
them
and
instinct
is
never
deceived
are
you
ready
take
a
lamp
ayrton
answered
the
engineer
we
will
start
at
once
ayrton
did
as
desired
the
onagers
unharnessed
roamed
in
the
corral
the
gate
was
secured
on
the
outside
and
cyrus
harding
preceding
ayrton
took
the
narrow
path
which
led
westward
to
the
shore
the
soil
they
walked
upon
was
choked
with
the
pulverized
matter
fallen
from
the
cloud
no
quadruped
appeared
in
the
woods
even
the
birds
had
fled
sometimes
a
passing
breeze
raised
the
covering
of
ashes
and
the
two
colonists
enveloped
in
a
whirlwind
of
dust
lost
sight
of
each
other
they
were
then
careful
to
cover
their
eyes
and
mouths
with
handkerchiefs
for
they
ran
the
risk
of
being
blinded
and
suffocated
it
was
impossible
for
cyrus
harding
and
ayrton
with
these
impediments
to
make
rapid
progress
moreover
the
atmosphere
was
close
as
if
the
oxygen
had
been
partly
burned
up
and
had
become
unfit
for
respiration
at
every
hundred
paces
they
were
obliged
to
stop
to
take
breath
it
was
therefore
past
ten
oclock
when
the
engineer
and
his
companion
reached
the
crest
of
the
enormous
mass
of
rocks
of
basalt
and
porphyry
which
composed
the
northwest
coast
of
the
island
ayrton
and
cyrus
harding
commenced
the
descent
of
this
abrupt
declivity
following
almost
step
for
step
the
difficult
path
which
during
that
stormy
night
had
led
them
to
dakkar
grotto
in
open
day
the
descent
was
less
perilous
and
besides
the
bed
of
ashes
which
covered
the
polished
surface
of
the
rock
enabled
them
to
make
their
footing
more
secure
the
ridge
at
the
end
of
the
shore
about
forty
feet
in
height
was
soon
reached
cyrus
harding
recollected
that
this
elevation
gradually
sloped
towards
the
level
of
the
sea
although
the
tide
was
at
present
low
no
beach
could
be
seen
and
the
waves
thickened
by
the
volcanic
dust
beat
upon
the
basaltic
rocks
cyrus
harding
and
ayrton
found
without
difficulty
the
entrance
to
dakkar
grotto
and
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
last
rock
before
it
the
iron
boat
should
be
there
said
the
engineer
it
is
here
captain
harding
replied
ayrton
drawing
towards
him
the
fragile
craft
which
was
protected
by
the
arch
of
the
vault
on
board
ayrton
the
two
colonists
stepped
into
the
boat
a
slight
undulation
of
the
waves
carried
it
farther
under
the
low
arch
of
the
crypt
and
there
ayrton
with
the
aid
of
flint
and
steel
lighted
the
lamp
he
then
took
the
oars
and
the
lamp
having
been
placed
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
so
that
its
rays
fell
before
them
cyrus
harding
took
the
helm
and
steered
through
the
shades
of
the
grotto
the
nautilus
was
there
no
longer
to
illuminate
the
cavern
with
its
electric
light
possibly
it
might
not
yet
be
extinguished
but
no
ray
escaped
from
the
depths
of
the
abyss
in
which
reposed
all
that
was
mortal
of
captain
nemo
the
light
afforded
by
the
lamp
although
feeble
nevertheless
enabled
the
engineer
to
advance
slowly
following
the
wall
of
the
cavern
a
deathlike
silence
reigned
under
the
vaulted
roof
or
at
least
in
the
anterior
portion
for
soon
cyrus
harding
distinctly
heard
the
rumbling
which
proceeded
from
the
bowels
of
the
mountain
that
comes
from
the
volcano
he
said
besides
these
sounds
the
presence
of
chemical
combinations
was
soon
betrayed
by
their
powerful
odor
and
the
engineer
and
his
companion
were
almost
suffocated
by
sulphurous
vapors
this
is
what
captain
nemo
feared
murmured
cyrus
harding
changing
countenance
we
must
go
to
the
end
notwithstanding
forward
replied
ayrton
bending
to
his
oars
and
directing
the
boat
towards
the
head
of
the
cavern
twentyfive
minutes
after
entering
the
mouth
of
the
grotto
the
boat
reached
the
extreme
end
cyrus
harding
then
standing
up
cast
the
light
of
the
lamp
upon
the
walls
of
the
cavern
which
separated
it
from
the
central
shaft
of
the
volcano
what
was
the
thickness
of
this
wall
it
might
be
ten
feet
or
a
hundred
feetit
was
impossible
to
say
but
the
subterranean
sounds
were
too
perceptible
to
allow
of
the
supposition
that
it
was
of
any
great
thickness
the
engineer
after
having
explored
the
wall
at
a
certain
height
horizontally
fastened
the
lamp
to
the
end
of
an
oar
and
again
surveyed
the
basaltic
wall
at
a
greater
elevation
there
through
scarcely
visible
clefts
and
joinings
escaped
a
pungent
vapor
which
infected
the
atmosphere
of
the
cavern
the
wall
was
broken
by
large
cracks
some
of
which
extended
to
within
two
or
three
feet
of
the
waters
edge
cyrus
harding
thought
for
a
brief
space
then
he
said
in
a
low
voice
yes
the
captain
was
right
the
danger
lies
there
and
a
terrible
danger
ayrton
said
not
a
word
but
upon
a
sign
from
cyrus
harding
resumed
the
oars
and
half
an
hour
later
the
engineer
and
he
reached
the
entrance
of
dakkar
grotto
chapter

the
next
day
the
8th
day
of
january
after
a
day
and
night
passed
at
the
corral
where
they
left
all
in
order
cyrus
harding
and
ayrton
arrived
at
granite
house
the
engineer
immediately
called
his
companions
together
and
informed
them
of
the
imminent
danger
which
threatened
lincoln
island
and
from
which
no
human
power
could
deliver
them
my
friends
he
said
and
his
voice
betrayed
the
depth
of
his
emotion
our
island
is
not
among
those
which
will
endure
while
this
earth
endures
it
is
doomed
to
more
or
less
speedy
destruction
the
cause
of
which
it
bears
within
itself
and
from
which
nothing
can
save
it
the
colonists
looked
at
each
other
then
at
the
engineer
they
did
not
clearly
comprehend
him
explain
yourself
cyrus
said
gideon
spilett
i
will
do
so
replied
cyrus
harding
or
rather
i
will
simply
afford
you
the
explanation
which
during
our
few
minutes
of
private
conversation
was
given
me
by
captain
nemo
captain
nemo
exclaimed
the
colonists
yes
and
it
was
the
last
service
he
desired
to
render
us
before
his
death
the
last
service
exclaimed
pencroft
the
last
service
you
will
see
that
though
he
is
dead
he
will
render
us
others
yet
but
what
did
the
captain
say
inquired
the
reporter
i
will
tell
you
my
friends
said
the
engineer
lincoln
island
does
not
resemble
the
other
islands
of
the
pacific
and
a
fact
of
which
captain
nemo
has
made
me
cognizant
must
sooner
or
later
bring
about
the
subversion
of
its
foundation
nonsense
lincoln
island
it
cant
be
cried
pencroft
who
in
spite
of
the
respect
he
felt
for
cyrus
harding
could
not
prevent
a
gesture
of
incredulity
listen
pencroft
resumed
the
engineer
i
will
tell
you
what
captain
nemo
communicated
to
me
and
which
i
myself
confirmed
yesterday
during
the
exploration
of
dakkar
grotto
this
cavern
stretches
under
the
island
as
far
as
the
volcano
and
is
only
separated
from
its
central
shaft
by
the
wall
which
terminates
it
now
this
wall
is
seamed
with
fissures
and
clefts
which
already
allow
the
sulphurous
gases
generated
in
the
interior
of
the
volcano
to
escape
well
said
pencroft
his
brow
suddenly
contracting
well
then
i
saw
that
these
fissures
widen
under
the
internal
pressure
from
within
that
the
wall
of
basalt
is
gradually
giving
way
and
that
after
a
longer
or
shorter
period
it
will
afford
a
passage
to
the
waters
of
the
lake
which
fill
the
cavern
good
replied
pencroft
with
an
attempt
at
pleasantry
the
sea
will
extinguish
the
volcano
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
matter
not
so
said
cyrus
harding
should
a
day
arrive
when
the
sea
rushing
through
the
wall
of
the
cavern
penetrates
by
the
central
shaft
into
the
interior
of
the
island
to
the
boiling
lava
lincoln
island
will
that
day
be
blown
into
the
airjust
as
would
happen
to
the
island
of
sicily
were
the
mediterranean
to
precipitate
itself
into
mount
etna
the
colonists
made
no
answer
to
these
significant
words
of
the
engineer
they
now
understood
the
danger
by
which
they
were
menaced
it
may
be
added
that
cyrus
harding
had
in
no
way
exaggerated
the
danger
to
be
apprehended
many
persons
have
formed
an
idea
that
it
would
be
possible
to
extinguish
volcanoes
which
are
almost
always
situated
on
the
shores
of
a
sea
or
lake
by
opening
a
passage
for
the
admission
of
the
water
but
they
are
not
aware
that
this
would
be
to
incur
the
risk
of
blowing
up
a
portion
of
the
globe
like
a
boiler
whose
steam
is
suddenly
expanded
by
intense
heat
the
water
rushing
into
a
cavity
whose
temperature
might
be
estimated
at
thousands
of
degrees
would
be
converted
into
steam
with
a
sudden
energy
which
no
enclosure
could
resist
it
was
not
therefore
doubtful
that
the
island
menaced
by
a
frightful
and
approaching
convulsion
would
endure
only
so
long
as
the
wall
of
dakkar
grotto
itself
should
endure
it
was
not
even
a
question
of
months
nor
of
weeks
but
of
days
it
might
be
of
hours
the
first
sentiment
which
the
colonists
felt
was
that
of
profound
sorrow
they
thought
not
so
much
of
the
peril
which
menaced
themselves
personally
but
of
the
destruction
of
the
island
which
had
sheltered
them
which
they
had
cultivated
which
they
loved
so
well
and
had
hoped
to
render
so
flourishing
so
much
effort
ineffectually
expended
so
much
labor
lost
pencroft
could
not
prevent
a
large
tear
from
rolling
down
his
cheek
nor
did
he
attempt
to
conceal
it
some
further
conversation
now
took
place
the
chances
yet
in
favor
of
the
colonists
were
discussed
but
finally
it
was
agreed
that
there
was
not
an
hour
to
be
lost
that
the
building
and
fitting
of
the
vessel
should
be
pushed
forward
with
their
utmost
energy
and
that
this
was
the
sole
chance
of
safety
for
the
inhabitants
of
lincoln
island
all
hands
therefore
set
to
work
on
the
vessel
what
could
it
avail
to
sow
to
reap
to
hunt
to
increase
the
stores
of
granite
house
the
contents
of
the
storehouse
and
outbuildings
contained
more
than
sufficient
to
provide
the
ship
for
a
voyage
however
long
might
be
its
duration
but
it
was
imperative
that
the
ship
should
be
ready
to
receive
them
before
the
inevitable
catastrophe
should
arrive
their
labors
were
now
carried
on
with
feverish
ardor
by
the
23rd
of
january
the
vessel
was
halfdecked
over
up
to
this
time
no
change
had
taken
place
on
the
summit
of
the
volcano
vapor
and
smoke
mingled
with
flames
and
incandescent
stones
were
thrown
up
from
the
crater
but
during
the
night
of
the
23rd
in
consequence
of
the
lava
attaining
the
level
of
the
first
stratum
of
the
volcano
the
hatshaped
cone
which
formed
over
the
latter
disappeared
a
frightful
sound
was
heard
the
colonists
at
first
thought
the
island
was
rent
asunder
and
rushed
out
of
granite
house
this
occurred
about
two
oclock
in
the
morning
the
sky
appeared
on
fire
the
superior
cone
a
mass
of
rock
a
thousand
feet
in
height
and
weighing
thousands
of
millions
of
pounds
had
been
thrown
down
upon
the
island
making
it
tremble
to
its
foundation
fortunately
this
cone
inclined
to
the
north
and
had
fallen
upon
the
plain
of
sand
and
tufa
stretching
between
the
volcano
and
the
sea
the
aperture
of
the
crater
being
thus
enlarged
projected
towards
the
sky
a
glare
so
intense
that
by
the
simple
effect
of
reflection
the
atmosphere
appeared
redhot
at
the
same
time
a
torrent
of
lava
bursting
from
the
new
summit
poured
out
in
long
cascades
like

towards

that
the

consequently
the

arrived
at

the

the

them
already
a

from

gradually
from

it

to

the
colonists
were
desirous
of
reaching
the
plain
upon
which
the
superior
cone
of
mount
franklin
had
fallen
but
the
lava
arrested
their
progress
it
had
followed
on
one
side
the
valley
of
red
creek
and
on
the
other
that
of
falls
river
evaporating
those
watercourses
in
its
passage
there
was
no
possibility
of
crossing
the
torrent
of
lava
on
the
contrary
the
colonists
were
obliged
to
retreat
before
it
the
volcano
without
its
crown
was
no
longer
recognizable
terminated
as
it
was
by
a
sort
of
flat
table
which
replaced
the
ancient
crater
from
two
openings
in
its
southern
and
eastern
sides
an
unceasing
flow
of
lava
poured
forth
thus
forming
two
distinct
streams
above
the
new
crater
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
ashes
mingled
with
those
of
the
atmosphere
massed
over
the
island
loud
peals
of
thunder
broke
and
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
from
the
rumblings
of
the
mountain
whose
mouth
vomited
forth
ignited
rocks
which
hurled
to
more
than
a
thousand
feet

in
the

in
intensity
the
volcanos
eruption
towards
seven
in
the
morning
the
position
was
no
longer
tenable
by
the
colonists
who
accordingly
took
shelter
in
the
borders
of
jacamar
wood
not
only
did
the
projectiles
begin
to
rain
around
them
but
the
lava
overflowing
the
bed
of
red
creek
threatened
to
cut
off
the
road
to
the
corral
the
nearest
rows
of
trees
caught
fire
and
their
sap
suddenly
transformed
into
vapor
caused
them
to
explode
with
loud
reports
while
others
less
moist
remained
unhurt
in
the
midst
of
the
inundation
the
colonists
had
again
taken
the
road
to
the
corral
they
proceeded
but
slowly
frequently
looking
back
but
in
consequence
of
the
inclination
of
the
soil
the
lava
gained
rapidly
in
the
east
and
as
its
lower
waves
became
solidified
others
at
boiling
heat
covered
them
immediately
meanwhile
the
principal
stream
of
red
creek
valley
became
more
and
more
menacing
all
this
portion
of
the
forest
was
on
fire
and
enormous
wreaths
of
smoke
rolled
over
the
trees
whose
trunks
were
already
consumed
by
the
lava
the
colonists
halted
near
the
lake
about
half
a
mile
from
the
mouth
of
red
creek
a
question
of
life
or
death
was
now
to
be
decided
cyrus
harding
accustomed
to
the
consideration
of
important
crises
and
aware
that
he
was
addressing
men
capable
of
hearing
the
truth
whatever
it
might
be
then
said
either
the
lake
will
arrest
the
progress
of
the
lava
and
a
part
of
the
island
will
be
preserved
from
utter
destruction
or
the
stream
will
overrun
the
forests
of
the
far
west
and
not
a
tree
or
plant
will
remain
on
the
surface
of
the
soil
we
shall
have
no
prospect
but
that
of
starvation
upon
these
barren
rocksa
death
which
will
probably
be
anticipated
by
the
explosion
of
the
island
in
that
case
replied
pencroft
folding
his
arms
and
stamping
his
foot
whats
the
use
of
working
any
longer
on
the
vessel
pencroft
answered
cyrus
harding
we
must
do
our
duty
to
the
last
at
this
instant
the
river
of
lava
after
having
broken
a
passage
through
the
noble
trees
it
devoured
in
its
course
reached
the
borders
of
the
lake
at
this
point
there
was
an
elevation
of
the
soil
which
had
it
been
greater
might
have
sufficed
to
arrest
the
torrent
to
work
cried
cyrus
harding
the
engineers
thought
was
at
once
understood
it
might
be
possible
to
dam
as
it
were
the
torrent
and
thus
compel
it
to
pour
itself
into
the
lake
the
colonists
hastened
to
the
dockyard
they
returned
with
shovels
picks
axes
and
by
means
of
banking
the
earth
with
the
aid
of
fallen
trees
they
succeeded
in
a
few
hours
in
raising
an
embankment
three
feet
high
and
some
hundreds
of
paces
in
length
it
seemed
to
them
when
they
had
finished
as
if
they
had
scarcely
been
working
more
than
a
few
minutes
it
was
not
a
moment
too
soon
the
liquefied
substances
soon
after
reached
the
bottom
of
the
barrier
the
stream
of
lava
swelled
like
a
river
about
to
overflow
its
banks
and
threatened
to
demolish
the
sole
obstacle
which
could
prevent
it
from
overrunning
the
whole
far
west
but
the
dam
held
firm
and
after
a
moment
of
terrible
suspense
the
torrent
precipitated
itself
into
grant
lake
from
a
height
of
twenty
feet
the
colonists
without
moving
or
uttering
a
word
breathlessly
regarded
this
strife
of
the
two
elements
what
a
spectacle
was
this
conflict
between
water
and
fire
what
pen
could
describe
the
marvelous
horror
of
this
scenewhat
pencil
could
depict
it
the
water
hissed
as
it
evaporated
by
contact
with
the
boiling
lava
the
vapor
whirled
in
the
air
to
an
immeasurable
height
as
if
the
valves
of
an
immense
boiler
had
been
suddenly
opened
but
however
considerable
might
be
the
volume
of
water
contained
in
the
lake
it
must
eventually
be
absorbed
because
it
was
not
replenished
while
the
stream
of
lava
fed
from
an
inexhaustible
source
rolled
on
without
ceasing
new
waves
of
incandescent
matter
the
first
waves
of
lava
which
fell
in
the
lake
immediately
solidified
and
accumulated
so
as
speedily
to
emerge
from
it
upon
their
surface
fell
other
waves
which
in
their
turn
became
stone
but
a
step
nearer
the
center
of
the
lake
in
this
manner
was
formed
a
pier
which
threatened
to
gradually
fill
up
the
lake
which
could
not
overflow
the
water
displaced
by
the
lava
being
evaporated
the
hissing
of
the
water
rent
the
air
with
a
deafening
sound
and
the
vapor
blown
by
the
wind
fell
in
rain
upon
the
sea
the
pier
became
longer
and
longer
and
the
blocks
of
lava
piled
themselves
one
on
another
where
formerly
stretched
the
calm
waters
of
the
lake
now
appeared
an
enormous
mass
of
smoking
rocks
as
if
an
upheaving
of
the
soil
had
formed
immense
shoals
imagine
the
waters
of
the
lake
aroused
by
a
hurricane
then
suddenly
solidified
by
an
intense
frost
and
some
conception
may
be
formed
of
the
aspect
of
the
lake
three
hours
after
the
eruption
of
this
irresistible
torrent
of
lava
this
time
water
would
be
vanquished
by
fire
nevertheless
it
was
a
fortunate
circumstance
for
the
colonists
that
the
effusion
of
lava
should
have
been
in
the
direction
of
lake
grant
they
had
before
them
some
days
respite
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
granite
house
and
the
dockyard
were
for
the
moment
preserved
and
these
few
days
it
was
necessary
to
employ
in
planking
and
carefully
calking
the
vessel
and
launching
her
the
colonists
would
then
take
refuge
on
board
the
vessel
content
to
rig
her
after
she
should
be
afloat
on
the
waters
with
the
danger
of
an
explosion
which
threatened
to
destroy
the
island
there
could
be
no
security
on
shore
the
walls
of
granite
house
once
so
sure
a
retreat
might
at
any
moment
fall
in
upon
them
during
the
six
following
days
from
the
25th
to
the
30th
of
january
the
colonists
accomplished
as
much
of
the
construction
of
their
vessel
as
twenty
men
could
have
done
they
hardly
allowed
themselves
a
moments
repose
and
the
glare
of
the
flames
which
shot
from
the
crater
enabled
them
to
work
night
and
day
the
flow
of
lava
continued
but
perhaps
less
abundantly
this
was
fortunate
for
lake
grant
was
almost
entirely
choked
up
and
if
more
lava
should
accumulate
it
would
inevitably
spread
over
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
and
thence
upon
the
beach
but
if
the
island
was
thus
partially
protected
on
this
side
it
was
not
so
with
the
western
part
in
fact
the
second
stream
of
lava
which
had
followed
the
valley
of
falls
river
a
valley
of
great
extent
the
land
on
both
sides
of
the
creek
being
flat
met
with
no
obstacle
the
burning
liquid
had
then
spread
through
the
forest
of
the
far
west
at
this
period
of
the
year
when
the
trees
were
dried
up
by
a
tropical
heat
the
forest
caught
fire
instantaneously
in
such
a
manner
that
the
conflagration
extended
itself
both
by
the
trunks
of
the
trees
and
by
their
higher
branches
whose
interlacement
favored
its
progress
it
even
appeared
that
the
current
of
flame
spread
more
rapidly
among
the
summits
of
the
trees
than
the
current
of
lava
at
their
bases
thus
it
happened
that
the
wild
animals
jaguars
wild
boars
capybaras
koalas
and
game
of
every
kind
mad
with
terror
had
fled
to
the
banks
of
the
mercy
and
to
the
tadorn
marsh
beyond
the
road
to
port
balloon
but
the
colonists
were
too
much
occupied
with
their
task
to
pay
any
attention
to
even
the
most
formidable
of
these
animals
they
had
abandoned
granite
house
and
would
not
even
take
shelter
at
the
chimneys
but
encamped
under
a
tent
near
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
each
day
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
ascended
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
sometimes
herbert
accompanied
them
but
never
pencroft
who
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
the
prospect
of
the
island
now
so
utterly
devastated
it
was
in
truth
a
heartrending
spectacle
all
the
wooded
part
of
the
island
was
now
completely
bare
one
single
clump
of
green
trees
raised
their
heads
at
the
extremity
of
serpentine
peninsula
here
and
there
were
a
few
grotesque
blackened
and
branchless
stumps
the
side
of
the
devastated
forest
was
even
more
barren
than
tadorn
marsh
the
eruption
of
lava
had
been
complete
where
formerly
sprang
up
that
charming
verdure
the
soil
was
now
nothing
but
a
savage
mass
of
volcanic
tufa
in
the
valleys
of
the
falls
and
mercy
rivers
no
drop
of
water
now
flowed
towards
the
sea
and
should
lake
grant
be
entirely
dried
up
the
colonists
would
have
no
means
of
quenching
their
thirst
but
fortunately
the
lava
had
spared
the
southern
corner
of
the
lake
containing
all
that
remained
of
the
drinking
water
of
the
island
towards
the
northwest
stood
out
the
rugged
and
welldefined
outlines
of
the
sides
of
the
volcano
like
a
gigantic
claw
hovering
over
the
island
what
a
sad
and
fearful
sight
and
how
painful
to
the
colonists
who
from
a
fertile
domain
covered
with
forests
irrigated
by
watercourses
and
enriched
by
the
produce
of
their
toils
found
themselves
as
it
were
transported
to
a
desolate
rock
upon
which
but
for
their
reserves
of
provisions
they
could
not
even
gather
the
means
of
subsistence
it
is
enough
to
break
ones
heart
said
gideon
spilett
one
day
yes
spilett
answered
the
engineer
may
god
grant
us
the
time
to
complete
this
vessel
now
our
sole
refuge
do
not
you
think
cyrus
that
the
violence
of
the
eruption
has
somewhat
lessened
the
volcano
still
vomits
forth
lava
but
somewhat
less
abundantly
if
i
mistake
not
it
matters
little
answered
cyrus
harding
the
fire
is
still
burning
in
the
interior
of
the
mountain
and
the
sea
may
break
in
at
any
moment
we
are
in
the
condition
of
passengers
whose
ship
is
devoured
by
a
conflagration
which
they
cannot
extinguish
and
who
know
that
sooner
or
later
the
flames
must
reach
the
powdermagazine
to
work
spilett
to
work
and
let
us
not
lose
an
hour
during
eight
days
more
that
is
to
say
until
the
7th
of
february
the
lava
continued
to
flow
but
the
eruption
was
confined
within
the
previous
limits
cyrus
harding
feared
above
all
lest
the
liquefied
matter
should
overflow
the
shore
for
in
that
event
the
dockyard
could
not
escape
moreover
about
this
time
the
colonists
felt
in
the
frame
of
the
island
vibrations
which
alarmed
them
to
the
highest
degree
it
was
the
20th
of
february
yet
another
month
must
elapse
before
the
vessel
would
be
ready
for
sea
would
the
island
hold
together
till
then
the
intention
of
pencroft
and
cyrus
harding
was
to
launch
the
vessel
as
soon
as
the
hull
should
be
complete
the
deck
the
upperworks
the
interior
woodwork
and
the
rigging
might
be
finished
afterwards
but
the
essential
point
was
that
the
colonists
should
have
an
assured
refuge
away
from
the
island
perhaps
it
might
be
even
better
to
conduct
the
vessel
to
port
balloon
that
is
to
say
as
far
as
possible
from
the
center
of
eruption
for
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
between
the
islet
and
the
wall
of
granite
it
would
run
the
risk
of
being
crushed
in
the
event
of
any
convulsion
all
the
exertions
of
the
voyagers
were
therefore
concentrated
upon
the
completion
of
the
hull
thus
the
3rd
of
march
arrived
and
they
might
calculate
upon
launching
the
vessel
in
ten
days
hope
revived
in
the
hearts
of
the
colonists
who
had
in
this
fourth
year
of
their
sojourn
on
lincoln
island
suffered
so
many
trials
even
pencroft
lost
in
some
measure
the
somber
taciturnity
occasioned
by
the
devastation
and
ruin
of
his
domain
his
hopes
it
is
true
were
concentrated
upon
his
vessel
we
shall
finish
it
he
said
to
the
engineer
we
shall
finish
it
captain
and
it
is
time
for
the
season
is
advancing
and
the
equinox
will
soon
be
here
well
if
necessary
we
must
put
in
to
tabor
island
to
spend
the
winter
but
think
of
tabor
island
after
lincoln
island
ah
how
unfortunate
who
could
have
believed
it
possible
let
us
get
on
was
the
engineers
invariable
reply
and
they
worked
away
without
losing
a
moment
master
asked
neb
a
few
days
later
do
you
think
all
this
could
have
happened
if
captain
nemo
had
been
still
alive
certainly
neb
answered
cyrus
harding
i
for
one
dont
believe
it
whispered
pencroft
to
neb
nor
i
answered
neb
seriously
during
the
first
week
of
march
appearances
again
became
menacing
thousands
of
threads
like
glass
formed
of
fluid
lava
fell
like
rain
upon
the
island
the
crater
was
again
boiling
with
lava
which
overflowed
the
back
of
the
volcano
the
torrent
flowed
along
the
surface
of
the
hardened
tufa
and
destroyed
the
few
meager
skeletons
of
trees
which
had
withstood
the
first
eruption
the
stream
flowing
this
time
towards
the
southwest
shore
of
lake
grant
stretched
beyond
creek
glycerine
and
invaded
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
this
last
blow
to
the
work
of
the
colonists
was
terrible
the
mill
the
buildings
of
the
inner
court
the
stables
were
all
destroyed
the
affrighted
poultry
fled
in
all
directions
top
and
jup
showed
signs
of
the
greatest
alarm
as
if
their
instinct
warned
them
of
an
impending
catastrophe
a
large
number
of
the
animals
of
the
island
had
perished
in
the
first
eruption
those
which
survived
found
no
refuge
but
tadorn
marsh
save
a
few
to
which
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
afforded
asylum
but
even
this
last
retreat
was
now
closed
to
them
and
the
lavatorrent
flowing
over
the
edge
of
the
granite
wall
began
to
pour
down
upon
the
beach
its
cataracts
of
fire
the
sublime
horror
of
this
spectacle
passed
all
description
during
the
night
it
could
only
be
compared
to
a
niagara
of
molten
fluid
with
its
incandescent
vapors
above
and
its
boiling
masses
below
the
colonists
were
driven
to
their
last
entrenchment
and
although
the
upper
seams
of
the
vessel
were
not
yet
calked
they
decided
to
launch
her
at
once
pencroft
and
ayrton
therefore
set
about
the
necessary
preparations
for
the
launching
which
was
to
take
place
the
morning
of
the
next
day
the
9th
of
march
but
during
the
night
of
the
8th
an
enormous
column
of
vapor
escaping
from
the
crater
rose
with
frightful
explosions
to
a
height
of
more
than
three
thousand
feet
the
wall
of
dakkar
grotto
had
evidently
given
way
under
the
pressure
of
gases
and
the
sea
rushing
through
the
central
shaft
into
the
igneous
gulf
was
at
once
converted
into
vapor
but
the
crater
could
not
afford
a
sufficient
outlet
for
this
vapor
an
explosion
which
might
have
been
heard
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
miles
shook
the
air
fragments
of
mountains
fell
into
the
pacific
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
ocean
rolled
over
the
spot
where
lincoln

stood

from

all
that
could
now
be

of

was
the

now
served
as
a
refuge
to
the
six
colonists

had

was
because
assembled
under

they
had
been
hurled
into
the
sea
at
the
instant
when
the
fragments
of
the
island
rained
down
on
every
side
when
they
reached
the
surface
they
could
only
perceive
at
half
a
cables
length
this
mass
of
rocks
towards
which
they
swam
and
on
which
they
found
footing
on
this
barren
rock
they
had
now
existed
for
nine
days
a
few
provisions
taken
from
the
magazine
of

house
before
the
catastrophe
a
little
fresh
water
from
the
rain
which
had
fallen
in
a
hollow
of
the
rock

all
that
the
unfortunate
colonists
possessed
their
last
hope
the

been
shattered

pieces
they
had
no

it
seemed
that
they
must
inevitably
perish
this
day
the
18th
of
march
there
remained
only
provisions
for
two
days
although
they
limited
their
consumption
to
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
all
their
science
and

could
avail
them

gideon

on

not
for

ah
what
a
misfortune
what

misfortune

captain

did
right
to
die
said
neb
during
the
five
ensuing
days
cyrus
harding
and
his
unfortunate
companions
husbanded
their
provisions
with
the
most
extreme
care
eating
only
what
would
prevent
them
from
dying
of
starvation
their
weakness
was
extreme
herbert
and
neb
began
to
show
symptoms
of
delirium
under
these
circumstances
was
it
possible
for
them
to
retain
even
the
shadow
of
a
hope
no
what
was
their
sole
remaining
chance
that
a
vessel
should
appear
in
sight
of
the
rock
but
they
knew
only
too
well
from
experience
that
no
ships
ever
visited
this
part
of
the
pacific
could
they
calculate
that
by
a
truly
providential
coincidence
the
scotch
yacht
would
arrive
precisely
at
this
time
in
search
of
ayrton
at
tabor
island
it
was
scarcely
probable
and
besides
supposing
she
should
come
there
as
the
colonists
had
not
been
able
to
deposit
a
notice
pointing
out
ayrtons
change
of
abode
the
commander
of
the
yacht
after
having
explored
tabor
island
without
results
would
again
set
sail
and
return
to
lower
latitudes
no
no
hope
of
being
saved
could
be
retained
and
a
horrible
death
death
from
hunger
and
thirst
awaited
them
upon
this
rock
already
they
were
stretched
on
the
rock
inanimate
and
no
longer
conscious
of
what
passed
around
them
ayrton
alone
by
a
supreme
effort
from
time
to
time
raised
his
head
and
cast
a
despairing
glance
over
the
desert
ocean
but
on
the
morning
of
the
24th
of
march
ayrtons
arms
were
extended
toward
a
point
in
the
horizon
he
raised
himself
at
first
on
his
knees
then
upright
and
his
hand
seemed
to
make
a
signal
a
sail
was
in
sight
off
the
rock
she
was
evidently
not
without
an
object
the
reef
was
the
mark
for
which
she
was
making
in
a
direct
line
under
all
steam
and
the
unfortunate
colonists
might
have
made
her
out
some
hours
before
if
they
had
had
the
strength
to
watch
the
horizon
the
duncan
murmured
ayrtonand
fell
back
without
sign
of
life
when
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
recovered
consciousness
thanks
to
the
attention
lavished
upon
them
they
found
themselves
in
the
cabin
of
a
steamer
without
being
able
to
comprehend
how
they
had
escaped
death
a
word
from
ayrton
explained
everything
the
duncan
he
murmured
the
duncan
exclaimed
cyrus
harding
and
raising
his
hand
to
heaven
he
said
oh
almighty
god
mercifully
hast
thou
preserved
us
it
was
in
fact
the
duncan
lord
glenarvans
yacht
now
commanded
by
robert
son
of
captain
grant
who
had
been
despatched
to
tabor
island
to
find
ayrton
and
bring
him
back
to
his
native
land
after
twelve
years
of
expiation
the
colonists
were
not
only
saved
but
already
on
the
way
to
their
native
country
captain
grant
asked
cyrus
harding
who
can
have
suggested
to
you
the
idea
after
having
left
tabor
island
where
you
did
not
find
ayrton
of
coming
a
hundred
miles
farther
northeast
captain
harding
replied
robert
grant
it
was
in
order
to
find
not
only
ayrton
but
yourself
and
your
companions
my
companions
and
myself
doubtless
at
lincoln
island
at
lincoln
island
exclaimed
in
a
breath
gideon
spilett
herbert
neb
and
pencroft
in
the
highest
degree
astonished
how
could
you
be
aware
of
the
existence
of
lincoln
island
inquired
cyrus
harding
it
is
not
even
named
in
the
charts
i
knew
of
it
from
a
document
left
by
you
on
tabor
island
answered

cried
gideon
spilett
without
doubt
and
here
it
is
answered
robert
grant
producing
a
paper
which
indicated
the
longitude
and
latitude
of

island
the

residence
of

five
american

captain
nemo
cried
cyrus
harding
after
having
read
the
notice
and
recognized
that
the
handwriting
was
similar
to
that
of
the
paper
found
at
the
corral
ah
said
pencroft
it
was
then
he
who
took
our
bonadventure
and
hazarded
himself
alone
to
go
to
tabor
island
in
order
to
leave
this
notice
added
herbert
i
was
then
right
in
saying
exclaimed
the
sailor
that
even
after
his
death
the
captain
would
render
us
a
last
service
my
friends
said
cyrus
harding
in
a
voice
of
the
profoundest
emotion
may
the
god
of
mercy
have
had
pity
on
the
soul
of
captain
nemo
our
benefactor
the
colonists
uncovered
themselves
at
these
last
words
of
cyrus
harding
and
murmured
the
name
of
captain
nemo
then
ayrton
approaching
the
engineer
said
simply
where
should
this
coffer
be
deposited
it
was
the
coffer
which
ayrton
had
saved
at
the
risk
of
his
life
at
the
very
instant
that
the
island
had
been
engulfed
and
which
he
now
faithfully
handed
to
the
engineer
ayrton
ayrton
said
cyrus
harding
deeply
touched
then
addressing
robert
grant
sir
he
added
you
left
behind
you
a
criminal
you
find
in
his
place
a
man
who
has
become
honest
by
penitence
and
whose
hand
i
am
proud
to
clasp
in
mine
robert
grant
was
now
made
acquainted
with
the
strange
history
of
captain
nemo
and
the
colonists
of
lincoln
island
then

taken

what

of
this
shoal
which

figure
on

charts
of
the

the
order
was
given
to
make
all
sail
a
few
weeks
afterwards
the
colonists
landed
in
america
and
found
their
country
once
more
at
peace
after
the
terrible
conflict
in
which
right
and
justice
had
triumphed
of
the
treasures
contained
in
the
coffer
left
by
captain
nemo
to
the
colonists
of
lincoln
island
the
larger
portion
was
employed
in
the
purchase
of
a
vast
territory
in

state
of
iowa
one
pearl

the

of
the
castaways
restored
to
their

there
upon

the

all
those
to
whom
they
had

this

but
the
specific
stimulus
for
this
novel
was
an
1865
fan
letter
from
a
fellow
writer
madame
george

she
praised
vernes

narrative

influenced
by
the
1863
uprising
of
poland
against
tsarist

the

quashed
with
a

appalled

with

word
is

these

apply
here
the
subtitle
of
the

yet
this
loose
structure
gives
the
novel
an
air
of
documentary
realism
whats
more
verne
adds
backbone
to
the
action
by
developing
three
recurring
motifs
the
deepening
mystery
of
nemos
past
life
and
future
intentions
the
mounting
tension
between
nemo
and
hottempered
harpooner
ned
land
and
neds
ongoing
schemes
to
escape
from
the
nautilus
these
unifying
threads
tighten
the
narrative
and
accelerate
its
momentum
other
subtleties
occur
inside
each
episode
the
textures
sparkling
with
wit
information
and
insight
verne
regards
the
sea
from
many
angles
in
the
domain
of
marine

gives
us
thumbnail

sometimes
in

catalogs
that
swirl
past
like

of

he
studies
volcanoes
literally
inside

out
in
the
world
of

he
celebrates
the
highenergy
entrepreneurs
who
lay

atlantic

and
vernes
marine

proves
especially
authoritative
his
specifications
for
an
opensea
submarine
and
a
selfcontained
diving
suit
were
decades
before
their
time

them

a
runaway
reef
the
year
1866
was
marked
by
a
bizarre
development
an
unexplained
and
downright
inexplicable
phenomenon
that
surely
no
one
has
forgotten
without
getting
into
those
rumors
that
upset
civilians
in
the
seaports
and
deranged
the
public
mind
even
far
inland
it
must
be
said
that
professional
seamen
were
especially
alarmed
traders
shipowners
captains
of
vessels
skippers
and
master
mariners
from
europe
and
america
naval
officers
from
every
country
and
at
their
heels
the
various
national
governments
on
these
two
continents
were
all
extremely
disturbed
by
the
business
in
essence
over
a
period
of
time
several
ships
had
encountered
an
enormous
thing
at
sea
a
long
spindleshaped
object
sometimes
giving
off
a
phosphorescent
glow
infinitely
bigger
and
faster
than
any
whale
the
relevant
data
on
this
apparition
as
recorded
in
various
logbooks
agreed
pretty
closely
as
to
the
structure
of
the
object
or
creature
in
question
its
unprecedented
speed
of
movement
its
startling
locomotive
power
and
the
unique
vitality
with
which
it
seemed
to
be
gifted
if
it
was
a
cetacean
it
exceeded
in
bulk
any
whale
previously
classified
by
science
no
naturalist
neither
cuvier
nor
lacpde
neither
professor
dumeril
nor
professor
de

would
have
accepted
the
existence
of
such
a

unseen
by
their
own
scientific
eyes
striking
an
average
of
observations
taken
at
different
timesrejecting
those
timid
estimates
that
gave
the
object
a
length
of
200
feet
and
ignoring
those
exaggerated
views
that
saw
it
as
a
mile
wide
and
three
longyou
could
still
assert
that
this
phenomenal
creature
greatly
exceeded
the
dimensions
of
anything
then
known
to
ichthyologists
if
it
existed
at
all
now
then
it
did
exist
this
was
an
undeniable
fact
and
since
the
human
mind
dotes
on
objects
of
wonder
you
can
understand
the
worldwide
excitement
caused
by
this
unearthly
apparition
as
for
relegating
it
to
the
realm
of
fiction
that
charge
had
to
be
dropped
in
essence
on

1866
the

higginson
from

captain

thought
he
was
in
the
presence
of
an
unknown
reef
he
was
even
about
to
fix
its
exact
position
when
two
waterspouts
shot
out
of
this
inexplicable
object
and
sprang
hissing
into
the
air
some
150
feet
so
unless
this
reef
was
subject
to
the
intermittent
eruptions
of
a
geyser
the
governor
higginson
had
fair
and
honest
dealings
with
some
aquatic
mammal
until
then
unknown
that
could
spurt
from
its
blowholes
waterspouts
mixed
with

similar
events
were
likewise
observed
in

consequently
this
extraordinary
cetacean
could
transfer
itself
from
one
locality
to
another
with
startling
swiftness
since
within
an
interval
of
just
three
days
the
governor
higginson
and
the
christopher
columbus
had
observed
it
at
two
positions
on
the

by
a
distance
of
more
than
700

to
all

as
can
be
seen
in
a
recent
survey
of
official
documents
given
this
no
one
will
be
astonished
at
the
uproar
provoked
by
this
accident
involving
one
of
its
finest
steamers
on
april
13
1867
with
a
smooth
sea
and
a
moderate
breeze
the
scotia
lay
in
longitude
15
degrees
12
and
latitude
45
degrees
37
it
was
traveling
at
a
speed
of
1343
knots
under
the
thrust
of
its
1000horsepower
engines
its
paddle
wheels
were
churning
the
sea
with
perfect
steadiness
it
was
then
drawing
67
meters
of
water
and
displacing
6624
cubic
meters
at
417
in
the
afternoon
during
a
high
tea
for
passengers
gathered
in
the
main
lounge
a
collision
occurred
scarcely
noticeable
on
the
whole
affecting
the
scotias
hull
in
that
quarter
a
little
astern
of
its
port
paddle
wheel
the
scotia
hadnt
run
afoul
of
something
it
had
been
fouled
and
by
a
cutting
or
perforating
instrument
rather
than
a
blunt
one
this
encounter
seemed
so
minor
that
nobody
on
board
would
have
been
disturbed
by
it
had
it
not
been
for
the
shouts
of
crewmen
in
the
hold
who
climbed
on
deck
yelling
were
sinking
were
sinking
at
first
the
passengers
were
quite
frightened
but
captain
anderson
hastened
to
reassure
them
in
fact
there
could
be
no
immediate
danger
divided
into
seven
compartments
by
watertight
bulkheads
the
scotia
could
brave
any
leak
with
impunity
captain
anderson
immediately
made
his
way
into
the
hold
he
discovered
that
the
fifth
compartment
had
been
invaded
by
the
sea
and
the
speed
of
this
invasion
proved
that
the
leak
was
considerable
fortunately
this
compartment
didnt
contain
the
boilers
because
their
furnaces
would
have
been
abruptly
extinguished
captain
anderson
called
an
immediate
halt
and
one
of
his
sailors
dived
down
to
assess
the
damage
within
moments
they
had
located
a
hole
two
meters
in
width
on
the
steamers
underside
such
a
leak
could
not
be
patched
and
with
its
paddle
wheels
half
swamped
the
scotia
had
no
choice
but
to
continue
its
voyage
by
then
it
lay
300
miles
from
cape
clear
and
after
three
days
of
delay
that
filled
liverpool
with
acute
anxiety
it
entered
the
company
docks
the
engineers
then
proceeded
to
inspect
the
scotia
which
had
been
put
in
dry
dock
they
couldnt
believe
their
eyes
two
and
a
half
meters
below
its
waterline
there
gaped
a
symmetrical
gash
in
the
shape
of
an
isosceles
triangle
this
breach
in
the
sheet
iron
was
so
perfectly
formed
no
punch
could
have
done
a
cleaner
job
of
it
consequently
it
must
have
been
produced
by
a
perforating
tool
of
uncommon
toughnessplus
after
being
launched
with
prodigious
power
and
then
piercing
four
centimeters
of
sheet
iron
this
tool
had
needed
to
withdraw
itself
by
a
backward
motion
truly
inexplicable
this
was
the
last
straw
and
it
resulted
in
arousing
public
passions
all
over
again
indeed
from
this
moment
on
any
maritime
casualty
without
an
established
cause
was
charged
to
the
monsters
account
this
outrageous
animal
had
to
shoulder
responsibility
for
all
derelict
vessels
whose
numbers
are
unfortunately
considerable
since
out
of
those
3000
ships
whose
losses
are
recorded
annually
at
the
marine
insurance
bureau
the
figure
for
steam
or
sailing
ships
supposedly
lost
with
all
hands
in
the
absence
of
any
news
amounts
to
at
least
200
now
then
justly
or
unjustly
it
was
the
monster
who
stood
accused
of
their
disappearance
and
since
thanks
to
it
travel
between
the
various
continents
had
become
more
and
more
dangerous
the
public
spoke
up
and
demanded
straight
out
that
at
all
cost
the
seas
be
purged
of
this
fearsome
cetacean
chapter
2
the
pros
and
cons
during
the
period
in
which
these
developments
were
occurring
i
had
returned
from
a
scientific
undertaking
organized
to
explore
the
nebraska
badlands
in
the
united
states
in
my
capacity
as
assistant
professor
at
the
paris
museum
of
natural
history
i
had
been
attached
to
this
expedition
by
the
french
government
after
spending
six
months
in
nebraska
i
arrived
in
new
york
laden
with
valuable
collections
near
the
end
of
march
my
departure
for
france
was
set
for
early
may
in
the
meantime
then
i
was
busy
classifying
my
mineralogical
botanical
and
zoological
treasures
when
that
incident
took
place
with
the
scotia
i
was
perfectly
abreast
of
this
question
which
was
the
big
news
of
the
day
and
how
could
i
not
have
been
i
had
read
and
reread
every
american
and
european
newspaper
without
being
any
farther
along
this
mystery
puzzled
me
finding
it
impossible
to
form
any
views
i
drifted
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
something
was
out
there
that
much
was
certain
and
any
doubting
thomas
was
invited
to
place
his
finger
on
the
scotias
wound
when
i
arrived
in
new
york
the
question
was
at
the
boiling
point
the
hypothesis
of
a
drifting
islet
or
an
elusive
reef
put
forward
by
people
not
quite
in
their
right
minds
was
completely
eliminated
and
indeed
unless
this
reef
had
an
engine
in
its
belly
how
could
it
move
about
with
such
prodigious
speed
also
discredited
was
the
idea
of
a
floating
hull
or
some
other
enormous
wreckage
and
again
because
of
this
speed
of
movement
so
only
two
possible
solutions
to
the
question
were
left
creating
two
very
distinct
groups
of
supporters
on
one
side
those
favoring
a
monster
of
colossal
strength
on
the
other
those
favoring
an
underwater
boat
of
tremendous
motor
power
now
then
although
the
latter
hypothesis
was
completely
admissible
it
couldnt
stand
up
to
inquiries
conducted
in
both
the
new
world
and
the
old
that
a
private
individual
had
such
a
mechanism
at
his
disposal
was
less
than
probable
where
and
when
had
he
built
it
and
how
could
he
have
built
it
in
secret
only
some
government
could
own
such
an
engine
of
destruction
and
in
these
disasterfilled
times
when
men
tax
their
ingenuity
to
build
increasingly
powerful
aggressive
weapons
it
was
possible
that
unknown
to
the
rest
of
the
world
some
nation
could
have
been
testing
such
a
fearsome
machine
the
chassepot
rifle
led
to
the
torpedo
and
the
torpedo
has
led
to
this
underwater
battering
ram
which
in
turn
will
lead
to
the
world
putting
its
foot
down
at
least
i
hope
it
will
but
this
hypothesis
of
a
war
machine
collapsed
in
the
face
of
formal
denials
from
the
various
governments
since
the
public
interest
was
at
stake
and
transoceanic
travel
was
suffering
the
sincerity
of
these
governments
could
not
be
doubted
besides
how
could
the
assembly
of
this
underwater
boat
have
escaped
public
notice
keeping
a
secret
under
such
circumstances
would
be
difficult
enough
for
an
individual
and
certainly
impossible
for
a
nation
whose
every
move
is
under
constant
surveillance
by
rival
powers
so
after
inquiries
conducted
in
england
france
russia
prussia
spain
italy
america
and
even
turkey
the
hypothesis
of
an
underwater
monitor
was
ultimately
rejected
and
so
the
monster
surfaced
again
despite
the
endless
witticisms
heaped
on
it
by
the
popular
press
and
the
human
imagination
soon
got
caught
up
in
the
most
ridiculous
ichthyological
fantasies
after
i
arrived
in
new
york
several
people
did
me
the
honor
of
consulting
me
on
the
phenomenon
in
question
in
france
i
had
published
a
twovolume
work
in
quarto
entitled
the
mysteries
of
the
great
ocean
depths
well
received
in
scholarly
circles
this
book
had
established
me
as
a
specialist
in
this
pretty
obscure
field
of
natural
history
my
views
were
in
demand
as
long
as
i
could
deny
the
reality
of
the
business
i
confined
myself
to
a
flat
no
comment
but
soon
pinned
to
the
wall
i
had
to
explain
myself
straight
out
and
in
this
vein
the
honorable
pierre
aronnax
professor
at
the
paris
museum
was
summoned
by
the
new
york
herald
to
formulate
his
views
no
matter
what
i
complied
since
i
could
no
longer
hold
my
tongue
i
let
it
wag
i
discussed
the
question
in
its
every
aspect
both
political
and
scientific
and
this
is
an
excerpt
from
the
wellpadded
article
i
published
in
the
issue
of
april
30
therefore
i
wrote
after
examining
these
different
hypotheses
one
by
one
we
are
forced
every
other
supposition
having
been
refuted
to
accept
the
existence
of
an
extremely
powerful
marine
animal
the
deepest
parts
of
the
ocean
are
totally
unknown
to
us
no
soundings
have
been
able
to
reach
them
what
goes
on
in
those
distant
depths
what
creatures
inhabit
or
could
inhabit
those
regions
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
what
is
the
constitution
of
these
animals
its
almost
beyond
conjecture
however
the
solution
to
this
problem
submitted
to
me
can
take
the
form
of
a
choice
between
two
alternatives
either
we
know
every
variety
of
creature
populating
our
planet
or
we
do
not
if
we
do
not
know
every
one
of
them
if
nature
still
keeps
ichthyological
secrets
from
us
nothing
is
more
admissible
than
to
accept
the
existence
of
fish
or
cetaceans
of
new
species
or
even
new
genera
animals
with
a
basically
castiron
constitution
that
inhabit
strata
beyond
the
reach
of
our
soundings
and
which
some
development
or
other
an
urge
or
a
whim
if
you
prefer
can
bring
to
the
upper
level
of
the
ocean
for
long
intervals
if
on
the
other
hand
we
do
know
every
living
species
we
must
look
for
the
animal
in
question
among
those
marine
creatures
already
cataloged
and
in
this
event
i
would
be
inclined
to
accept
the
existence
of
a
giant
narwhale
the
common
narwhale
or
sea
unicorn
often
reaches
a
length
of
sixty
feet
increase
its
dimensions
fivefold
or
even
tenfold
then
give
this
cetacean
a
strength
in
proportion
to
its
size
while
enlarging
its
offensive
weapons
and
you
have
the
animal
were
looking
for
it
would
have
the
proportions
determined
by
the
officers
of
the
shannon
the
instrument
needed
to
perforate
the
scotia
and
the
power
to
pierce
a
steamers
hull
in
essence
the
narwhale
is
armed
with
a
sort
of
ivory
sword
or
lance
as
certain
naturalists
have
expressed
it
its
a
kingsized
tooth
as
hard
as
steel
some
of
these
teeth
have
been
found
buried
in
the
bodies
of
baleen
whales
which
the
narwhale
attacks
with
invariable
success
others
have
been
wrenched
not
without
difficulty
from
the
undersides
of
vessels
that
narwhales
have
pierced
clean
through
as
a
gimlet
pierces
a
wine
barrel
the
museum
at
the
faculty
of
medicine
in
paris
owns
one
of
these
tusks
with
a
length
of
225
meters
and
a
width
at
its
base
of
fortyeight
centimeters
all
right
then
imagine
this
weapon
to
be
ten
times
stronger
and
the
animal
ten
times
more
powerful
launch
it
at
a
speed
of
twenty
miles
per
hour
multiply
its
mass
times
its
velocity
and
you
get
just
the
collision
we
need
to
cause
the
specified
catastrophe
so
until
information
becomes
more
abundant
i
plump
for
a
sea
unicorn
of
colossal
dimensions
no
longer
armed
with
a
mere
lance
but
with
an
actual
spur
like
ironclad
frigates
or
those
warships
called
rams
whose
mass
and
motor
power
it
would
possess
simultaneously
this
inexplicable
phenomenon
is
thus
explained
awayunless
its
something
else
entirely
which
despite
everything
that
has
been
sighted
studied
explored
and
experienced
is
still
possible
these
last
words
were
cowardly
of
me
but
as
far
as
i
could
i
wanted
to
protect
my
professorial
dignity
and
not
lay
myself
open
to
laughter
from
the
americans
who
when
they
do
laugh
laugh
raucously
i
had
left
myself
a
loophole
yet
deep
down
i
had
accepted
the
existence
of
the
monster
my
article
was
hotly
debated
causing
a
fine
old
uproar
it
rallied
a
number
of
supporters
moreover
the
solution
it
proposed
allowed
for
free
play
of
the
imagination
the
human
mind
enjoys
impressive
visions
of
unearthly
creatures
now
then
the
sea
is
precisely
their
best
medium
the
only
setting
suitable
for
the
breeding
and
growing
of
such
giantsnext
to
which
such
land
animals
as
elephants
or
rhinoceroses
are
mere
dwarves
the
liquid
masses
support
the
largest
known
species
of
mammals
and
perhaps
conceal
mollusks
of
incomparable
size
or
crustaceans
too
frightful
to
contemplate
such
as
100meter
lobsters
or
crabs
weighing
200
metric
tons
why
not
formerly
in
prehistoric
days
land
animals
quadrupeds
apes
reptiles
birds
were
built
on
a
gigantic
scale
our
creator
cast
them
using
a
colossal
mold
that
time
has
gradually
made
smaller
with
its
untold
depths
couldnt
the
sea
keep
alive
such
huge
specimens
of
life
from
another
age
this
sea
that
never
changes
while
the
land
masses
undergo
almost
continuous
alteration
couldnt
the
heart
of
the
ocean
hide
the
lastremaining
varieties
of
these
titanic
species
for
whom
years
are
centuries
and
centuries
millennia
but
i
mustnt
let
these
fantasies
run
away
with
me
enough
of
these
fairy
tales
that
time
has
changed
for
me
into
harsh
realities
i
repeat
opinion
had
crystallized
as
to
the
nature
of
this
phenomenon
and
the
public
accepted
without
argument
the
existence
of
a
prodigious
creature
that
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
fabled
sea
serpent
yet
if
some
saw
it
purely
as
a
scientific
problem
to
be
solved
more
practical
people
especially
in
america
and
england
were
determined
to
purge
the
ocean
of
this
daunting
monster
to
insure
the
safety
of
transoceanic
travel
the
industrial
and
commercial
newspapers
dealt
with
the
question
chiefly
from
this
viewpoint
the
shipping

mercantile
gazette
the
lloyds
list
frances

and

colonial
review
all
the
rags
devoted
to
insurance
companieswho
threatened
to
raise
their
premium
rateswere
unanimous
on
this
point
public
opinion
being
pronounced
the
states
of
the
union
were
the
first
in
the
field
in
new
york
preparations
were
under
way
for
an
expedition
designed
to
chase
this
narwhale
a
highspeed
frigate
the
abraham
lincoln
was
fitted
out
for
putting
to
sea
as
soon
as
possible
the
naval
arsenals
were
unlocked
for
commander
farragut
who
pressed
energetically
forward
with
the
arming
of
his
frigate
but
as
it
always
happens
just
when
a
decision
had
been
made
to
chase
the
monster
the
monster
put
in
no
further
appearances
for
two
months
nobody
heard
a
word
about
it
not
a
single
ship
encountered
it
apparently
the
unicorn
had
gotten
wise
to
these
plots
being
woven
around
it
people
were
constantly
babbling
about
the
creature
even
via
the
atlantic
cable
accordingly
the
wags
claimed
that
this
slippery
rascal
had
waylaid
some
passing
telegram
and
was
making
the
most
of
it
so
the
frigate
was
equipped
for
a
faroff
voyage
and
armed
with
fearsome
fishing
gear
but
nobody
knew
where
to
steer
it
and
impatience
grew
until
on
june
2
word
came
that
the
tampico
a
steamer
on
the
san
francisco
line
sailing
from
california
to
shanghai
had
sighted
the
animal
again
three
weeks
before
in
the
northerly
seas
of
the
pacific
this
news
caused
intense
excitement
not
even
a
24hour
breather
was
granted
to
commander
farragut
his
provisions
were
loaded
on
board
his
coal
bunkers
were
overflowing
not
a
crewman
was
missing
from
his
post
to
cast
off
he
needed
only
to
fire
and
stoke
his
furnaces
half
a
days
delay
would
have
been
unforgivable
but
commander
farragut
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
go
forth
i
received
a
letter

hours

as
master
wishes
three
seconds
before
the
arrival
of
j
b
hobsons
letter
i
no
more
dreamed
of
chasing
the
unicorn
than
of
trying
for
the
northwest
passage
three
seconds
after
reading
this
letter
from
the
honorable
secretary
of
the
navy
i
understood
at
last
that
my
true
vocation
my
sole
purpose
in
life
was
to
hunt
down
this
disturbing
monster
and
rid
the
world
of
it
even
so
i
had
just
returned
from
an
arduous
journey
exhausted
and
badly
needing
a
rest
i
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
see
my
country
again
my
friends
my
modest
quarters
by
the
botanical
gardens
my
dearly
beloved
collections
but
now
nothing
could
hold
me
back
i
forgot
everything
else
and
without
another
thought
of
exhaustion
friends
or
collections
i
accepted
the
american
governments
offer
besides
i
mused
all
roads
lead
home
to
europe
and
our
unicorn
may
be
gracious
enough
to
take
me
toward
the
coast
of
france
that
fine
animal
may
even
let
itself
be
captured
in
european
seasas
a
personal
favor
to
meand
ill
bring
back
to
the
museum
of
natural
history
at
least
half
a
meter
of
its
ivory
lance
but
in
the
meantime
i
would
have
to
look
for
this
narwhale
in
the
northern
pacific
ocean
which
meant
returning
to
france
by
way
of
the
antipodes
conseil
i
called
in
an
impatient
voice
conseil
was
my
manservant
a
devoted
lad
who
went
with
me
on
all
my
journeys
a
gallant
flemish
boy
whom
i
genuinely
liked
and
who
returned
the
compliment
a
born
stoic
punctilious
on
principle
habitually
hardworking
rarely
startled
by
lifes
surprises
very
skillful
with
his
hands
efficient
in
his
every
duty
and
despite
his
having
a
name
that
means
counsel
never
giving
advicenot
even
the
unsolicited
kind
from
rubbing
shoulders
with
scientists
in
our
little
universe
by
the
botanical
gardens
the
boy
had
come
to
know
a
thing
or
two
in
conseil
i
had
a
seasoned
specialist
in
biological
classification
an
enthusiast
who
could
run
with
acrobatic
agility
up
and
down
the
whole
ladder
of
branches
groups
classes
subclasses
orders
families
genera
subgenera
species
and
varieties
but
there
his
science
came
to
a
halt
classifying
was
everything
to
him
so
he
knew
nothing
else
well
versed
in
the
theory
of
classification
he
was
poorly
versed
in
its
practical
application
and
i
doubt
that
he
could
tell
a
sperm
whale
from
a
baleen
whale
and
yet
what
a
fine
gallant
lad
for
the
past
ten
years
conseil
had
gone
with
me
wherever
science
beckoned
not
once
did
he
comment
on
the
length
or
the
hardships
of
a
journey
never
did
he
object
to
buckling
up
his
suitcase
for
any
country
whatever
china
or
the
congo
no
matter
how
far
off
it
was
he
went
here
there
and
everywhere
in
perfect
contentment
moreover
he
enjoyed
excellent
health
that
defied
all
ailments
owned
solid
muscles
but
hadnt
a
nerve
in
him
not
a
sign
of
nervesthe
mental
type
i
mean
the
lad
was
thirty
years
old
and
his
age
to
that
of
his
employer
was
as
fifteen
is
to
twenty
please
forgive
me
for
this
underhanded
way
of
admitting
i
had
turned
forty
but
conseil
had
one
flaw
he
was
a
fanatic
on
formality
and
he
only
addressed
me
in
the
third
personto
the
point
where
it
got
tiresome
conseil
i
repeated
while
feverishly
beginning
my
preparations
for
departure
to
be
sure
i
had
confidence
in
this
devoted
lad
ordinarily
i
never
asked
whether
or
not
it
suited
him
to
go
with
me
on
my
journeys
but
this
time
an
expedition
was
at
issue
that
could
drag
on
indefinitely
a
hazardous
undertaking
whose
purpose
was
to
hunt
an
animal
that
could
sink
a
frigate
as
easily
as
a
walnut
shell
there
was
good
reason
to
stop
and
think
even
for
the
worlds
most
emotionless
man
what
would
conseil
say
conseil
i
called
a
third
time
conseil
appeared
did
master
summon
me
he
said
entering
yes
my
boy
get
my
things
ready
get
yours
ready
were
departing
in
two
hours
as
master
wishes
conseil
replied
serenely
we
havent
a
moment
to
lose
pack
as
much
into
my
trunk
as
you
can
my
traveling
kit
my
suits
shirts
and
socks
dont
bother
counting
just
squeeze
it
all
inand
hurry
what
about
masters
collections
conseil
ventured
to
observe
well
deal
with
them
later
what
the
archaeotherium
hyracotherium
oreodonts
cheiropotamus
and
masters
other
fossil
skeletons
the
hotel
will
keep
them
for
us
what
about
masters
live
babirusa
theyll
feed
it
during
our
absence
anyhow
well
leave
instructions
to
ship
the
whole
menagerie
to
france
then
we
arent
returning
to
paris
conseil
asked
yes
we
are



certainly




i
replied
evasively
but
after
we
make
a
detour
whatever
detour
master
wishes
oh
its
nothing
really
a
route
slightly
less
direct
thats
all
were
leaving
on
the
abraham
lincoln
as
master
thinks
best
conseil
replied
placidly
you
see
my
friend
its
an
issue
of
the
monster
the
notorious
narwhale
were
going
to
rid
the
seas
of
it

author
of
a
twovolume
work
in
quarto
on
the
mysteries
of
the
great
ocean
depths
has
no
excuse
for
not
setting
sail
with
commander
farragut
its
a
glorious
mission
but
also
a
dangerous
one
we
dont
know
where
it
will
take
us
these
beasts
can
be
quite
unpredictable
but
were
going
just
the
same
we
have
a
commander
whos
game
for
anything
what
master
does
ill
do
conseil
replied
but
think
it
over
because
i
dont
want
to
hide
anything
from
you
this
is
one
of
those
voyages
from
which
people
dont
always
come
back
as
master
wishes
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
our
trunks
were
ready
conseil
did
them
in
a
flash
and
i
was
sure
the
lad
hadnt
missed
a
thing
because
he
classified
shirts
and
suits
as
expertly
as
birds
and
mammals
the
hotel
elevator
dropped
us
off
in
the
main
vestibule
on
the
mezzanine
i
went
down
a
short
stair
leading
to
the
ground
floor
i
settled
my
bill
at
that
huge
counter
that
was
always
under
siege
by
a
considerable
crowd
i
left
instructions
for
shipping
my
containers
of
stuffed
animals
and
dried
plants
to
paris
france
i
opened
a
line
of
credit
sufficient
to
cover
the
babirusa
and
conseil
at
my
heels
i
jumped
into
a
carriage
for
a
fare
of
twenty
francs
the
vehicle
went
down
broadway
to
union
square
took
fourth
ave
to
its
junction
with
bowery
st
turned
into
katrin
st
and
halted
at
pier
34
there
the
katrin
ferry
transferred
men
horses
and
carriage
to
brooklyn
that
great
new
york
annex
located
on
the
left
bank
of
the
east
river
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
arrived
at
the
wharf
next
to
which
the
abraham
lincoln
was
vomiting
torrents
of
black
smoke
from
its
two
funnels
our
baggage
was
immediately
carried
to
the
deck
of
the
frigate
i
rushed
aboard
i
asked
for
commander
farragut
one
of
the
sailors
led
me
to
the
afterdeck
where
i
stood
in
the
presence
of
a
smartlooking
officer
who
extended
his
hand
to
me
professor
pierre
aronnax
he
said
to
me
the
same
i
replied
commander
farragut
in
person
welcome
aboard
professor
your
cabin
is
waiting
for
you
i
bowed
and
letting
the
commander
attend
to
getting
under
way
i
was
taken
to
the
cabin
that
had
been
set
aside
for
me
the
abraham
lincoln
had
been
perfectly
chosen
and
fitted
out
for
its
new
assignment
it
was
a
highspeed
frigate
furnished
with
superheating
equipment
that
allowed
the
tension
of
its
steam
to
build
to
seven
atmospheres
under
this
pressure
the
abraham
lincoln
reached
an
average
speed
of
183
miles
per
hour
a
considerable
speed
but
still
not
enough
to
cope
with
our
gigantic
cetacean
the
frigates
interior
accommodations
complemented
its
nautical
virtues
i
was
well
satisfied
with
my
cabin
which
was
located
in
the
stern
and
opened
into

be
quite
comfortable
here
i
told

with
all
due
respect
to

conseil
replied
as
comfortable
as

inside
the

i
left
conseil
to
the
proper
stowing
of
our
luggage
and
climbed
on
deck
to
watch
the
preparations
for
getting
under
way
just
then
commander
farragut
was
giving
orders
to
cast
off
the
last
moorings
holding
the
abraham
lincoln
to
its
brooklyn
pier
and
so
if
id
been
delayed
by
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
even
less
the
frigate
would
have
gone
without
me
and
i
would
have
missed
out
on
this
unearthly
extraordinary
and
inconceivable
expedition
whose
true
story
might
well
meet
with
some
skepticism
but
commander
farragut
didnt
want
to
waste
a
single
day
or
even
a
single
hour
in
making
for
those

where
the

then

called

decide

as
for
me
i
didnt
lag
behind
the
others
and
i
yielded
to
no
one
my
share
in
these
daily
observations
our
frigate
would
have
had
fivescore
good
reasons
for
renaming
itself
the

after
that
mythological
beast
with
100

the
lone
rebel
among
us
was
conseil
who
seemed
utterly
uninterested
in
the
question
exciting
us
and
was
out
of
step
with
the
general
enthusiasm
on
board
as
i
said
commander
farragut
had
carefully
equipped
his
ship
with
all
the
gear
needed
to
fish
for
a
gigantic
cetacean
no
whaling
vessel
could
have
been
better
armed
we
had
every
known
mechanism
from
the
handhurled
harpoon
to
the
blunderbuss
firing
barbed
arrows
to
the
duck
gun
with
exploding
bullets
on
the
forecastle
was
mounted
the
latest
model
breechloading
cannon
very
heavy
of
barrel
and
narrow
of
bore
a
weapon
that
would
figure
in
the
universal
exhibition
of
1867
made
in
america
this
valuable
instrument
could
fire
a
fourkilogram
conical
projectile
an
average
distance
of
sixteen
kilometers
without
the
least
bother
so
the
abraham
lincoln
wasnt
lacking
in
means
of
destruction
but
it
had
better
still
it
had
ned
land
the
king
of
harpooners
gifted
with
uncommon
manual
ability
ned
land
was
a
canadian
who
had
no
equal
in
his
dangerous
trade
dexterity
coolness
bravery
and
cunning
were
virtues
he
possessed
to
a
high
degree
and
it
took
a
truly
crafty
baleen
whale
or
an
exceptionally
astute
sperm
whale
to
elude
the
thrusts
of
his
harpoon
ned
land
was
about
forty
years
old
a
man
of
great
heightover
six
english
feethe
was
powerfully
built
serious
in
manner
not
very
sociable
sometimes
headstrong
and
quite
illtempered
when
crossed
his
looks
caught
the
attention
and
above
all
the
strength
of
his
gaze
which
gave
a
unique
emphasis
to
his
facial
appearance
commander
farragut
to
my
thinking
had
made
a
wise
move
in
hiring
on
this
man
with
his
eye
and
his
throwing
arm
he
was
worth
the
whole
crew
all
by
himself
i
can
do
no
better
than
to
compare
him
with
a
powerful
telescope
that
could
double
as
a
cannon
always
ready
to
fire
to
say
canadian
is
to
say
french
and
as
unsociable
as
ned
land
was
i
must
admit
he
took
a
definite
liking
to
me
no
doubt
it
was
my
nationality
that
attracted
him
it
was
an
opportunity
for
him
to
speak
and
for
me
to
hear
that
old
rabelaisian
dialect
still
used
in
some
canadian
provinces
the
harpooners
family
originated
in
quebec
and
they
were
already
a
line
of
bold
fishermen
back
in
the
days
when
this
town
still
belonged
to
france
little
by
little
ned
developed
a
taste
for
chatting
and
i
loved
hearing
the
tales
of
his
adventures
in
the
polar
seas
he
described
his
fishing
trips
and
his
battles
with
great
natural
lyricism
his
tales
took
on
the
form
of
an
epic
poem
and
i
felt
i
was
hearing
some
canadian
homer
reciting
his
iliad
of
the
high
arctic
regions
im
writing
of
this
bold
companion
as
i
currently
know
him
because
weve
become
old
friends
united
in
that
permanent
comradeship
born
and
cemented
during
only
the
most
frightful
crises
ah
my
gallant
ned
i
ask
only
to
live
100
years
more
the
longer
to
remember
you
and
now
what
were
ned
lands
views
on
this
question
of
a
marine
monster
i
must
admit
that
he
flatly
didnt
believe
in
the
unicorn
and
alone
on
board
he
didnt
share
the
general
conviction
he
avoided
even
dealing
with
the
subject
for
which
one
day
i
felt
compelled
to
take
him
to
task
during
the
magnificent
evening
of
june
25in
other
words
three
weeks
after
our
departurethe
frigate
lay
abreast
of
cabo
blanco
thirty
miles
to
leeward
of
the
coast
of
patagonia
we
had
crossed
the
tropic
of
capricorn
and
the
strait
of
magellan
opened
less
than
700
miles
to
the
south
before
eight
days
were
out
the
abraham
lincoln
would
plow
the
waves
of
the
pacific
seated
on
the
afterdeck
ned
land
and
i
chatted
about
one
thing
and
another
staring
at
that
mysterious
sea
whose
depths
to
this
day
are
beyond
the
reach
of
human
eyes
quite
naturally
i
led
our
conversation
around
to
the
giant
unicorn
and
i
weighed
our
expeditions
various
chances
for
success
or
failure
then
seeing
that
ned
just
let
me
talk
without
saying
much
himself
i
pressed
him
more
closely
ned
i
asked
him
how
can
you
still
doubt
the
reality
of
this
cetacean
were
after
do
you
have
any
particular
reasons
for
being
so
skeptical
the
harpooner
stared
at
me
awhile
before
replying
slapped
his
broad
forehead
in
one
of
his
standard
gestures
closed
his
eyes
as
if
to
collect
himself
and
finally
said
just
maybe
professor
aronnax
but
ned
youre
a
professional
whaler
a
man
familiar
with
all
the
great
marine
mammalsyour
mind
should
easily
accept
this
hypothesis
of
an
enormous
cetacean
and
you
ought
to
be
the
last
one
to
doubt
it
under
these
circumstances
thats
just
where
youre
mistaken
professor
ned
replied
the
common
man
may
still
believe
in
fabulous
comets
crossing
outer
space
or
in
prehistoric
monsters
living
at
the
earths
core
but
astronomers
and
geologists
dont
swallow
such
fairy
tales
its
the
same
with
whalers
ive
chased
plenty
of
cetaceans
ive
harpooned
a
good
number
ive
killed
several
but
no
matter
how
powerful
and
well
armed
they
were
neither
their
tails
or
their
tusks
could
puncture
the
sheetiron
plates
of
a
steamer
even
so
ned
people
mention
vessels
that
narwhale
tusks
have
run
clean
through
wooden
ships
maybe
the
canadian
replied
but
ive
never
seen
the
like
so
till
i
have
proof
to
the
contrary
ill
deny
that
baleen
whales
sperm
whales
or
unicorns
can
do
any
such
thing
listen
to
me
ned
no
no
professor
ill
go
along
with
anything
you
want
except
that
some
gigantic
devilfish
maybe




even
less
likely
ned
the
devilfish
is
merely
a
mollusk
and
even
this
name
hints
at
its
semiliquid
flesh
because
its
latin
meaning
soft
one
the
devilfish
doesnt
belong
to
the
vertebrate
branch
and
even
if
it
were
500
feet
long
it
would
still
be
utterly
harmless
to
ships
like
the
scotia
or
the
abraham
lincoln
consequently
the
feats
of
krakens
or
other
monsters
of
that
ilk
must
be
relegated
to
the
realm
of
fiction
so
mr
naturalist
ned
land
continued
in
a
bantering
tone
youll
just
keep
on
believing
in
the
existence
of
some
enormous
cetacean




yes
ned
i
repeat
it
with
a
conviction
backed
by
factual
logic
i
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
mammal
with
a
powerful
constitution
belonging
to
the
vertebrate
branch
like
baleen
whales
sperm
whales
or
dolphins
and
armed
with
a
tusk
made
of
horn
that
has
tremendous
penetrating
power
humph
the
harpooner
put
in
shaking
his
head
with
the
attitude
of
a
man
who
doesnt
want
to
be
convinced
note
well
my
fine
canadian
i
went
on
if
such
an
animal
exists
if
it
lives
deep
in
the
ocean
if
it
frequents
the
liquid
strata
located
miles
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
it
needs
to
have
a
constitution
so
solid
it
defies
all
comparison
and
why
this
powerful
constitution
ned
asked
because
it
takes
incalculable
strength
just
to
live
in
those
deep
strata
and
withstand
their
pressure
oh
really
ned
said
tipping
me
a
wink
oh
really
and
i
can
prove
it
to
you
with
a
few
simple
figures
bosh
ned
replied
you
can
make
figures
do
anything
you
want
in
business
ned
but
not
in
mathematics
listen
to
me
lets
accept
that
the
pressure
of
one
atmosphere
is
represented
by
the
pressure
of
a
column
of
water
thirtytwo
feet
high
in
reality
such
a
column
of
water
wouldnt
be
quite
so
high
because
here
were
dealing
with
salt
water
which
is
denser
than
fresh
water
well
then
when
you
dive
under
the
waves
ned
for
every
thirtytwo
feet
of
water
above
you
your
body
is
tolerating
the
pressure
of
one
more
atmosphere
in
other
words
one
more
kilogram
per
each
square
centimeter
on
your
bodys
surface
so
it
follows
that
at
320
feet
down
this
pressure
is
equal
to
ten
atmospheres
to
100
atmospheres
at
3200
feet
and
to
1000
atmospheres
at
32000
feet
that
is
at
about
two
and
a
half
vertical
leagues
down
which
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
if
you
could
reach
such
a
depth
in
the
ocean
each
square
centimeter
on
your
bodys
surface
would
be
experiencing
1000
kilograms
of
pressure
now
my
gallant
ned
do
you
know
how
many
square
centimeters
you
have
on
your
bodily
surface
i
havent
the
foggiest
notion
professor
aronnax
about
17000
as
many
as
that
yes
and
since
the
atmospheres
pressure
actually
weighs
slightly
more
than
one
kilogram
per
square
centimeter
your
17000
square
centimeters
are
tolerating
17568
kilograms
at
this
very
moment
without
my
noticing
it
without
your
noticing
it
and
if
you
arent
crushed
by
so
much
pressure
its
because
the
air
penetrates
the
interior
of
your
body
with
equal
pressure
when
the
inside
and
outside
pressures
are
in
perfect
balance
they
neutralize
each
other
and
allow
you
to
tolerate
them
without
discomfort
but
in
the
water
its
another
story
yes
i
see
ned
replied
growing
more
interested
because
the
water
surrounds
me
but
doesnt
penetrate
me
precisely
ned
so
at
thirtytwo
feet
beneath
the
surface
of
the
sea
youll
undergo
a
pressure
of
17568
kilograms
at
320
feet
or
ten
times
greater
pressure
its
175680
kilograms
at
3200
feet
or
100
times
greater
pressure
its
1756800
kilograms
finally
at
32000
feet
or
1000
times
greater
pressure
its
17568000
kilograms
in
other
words
youd
be
squashed
as
flat
as
if
youd
just
been
yanked
from
between
the
plates
of
a
hydraulic
press
fire
and
brimstone
ned
put
in
all
right
then
my
fine
harpooner
if
vertebrates
several
hundred
meters
long
and
proportionate
in
bulk
live
at
such
depths
their
surface
areas
make
up
millions
of
square
centimeters
and
the
pressure
they
undergo
must
be
assessed
in
billions
of
kilograms
calculate
then
how
much
resistance
of
bone
structure
and
strength
of
constitution
theyd
need
in
order
to
withstand
such
pressures
theyd
need
to
be
manufactured
ned
land
replied
from
sheetiron
plates
eight
inches
thick
like
ironclad
frigates
right
ned
and
then
picture
the
damage
such
a
mass
could
inflict
if
it
were
launched
with
the
speed
of
an
express
train
against
a
ships
hull
yes



indeed



maybe
the
canadian
replied
staggered
by
these
figures
but
still
not
willing
to
give
in
well
have
i
convinced
you
youve
convinced
me
of
one
thing
mr
naturalist
that
deep
in
the
sea
such
animals
would
need
to
be
just
as
strong
as
you
sayif
they
exist
but
if
they
dont
exist
my
stubborn
harpooner
how
do
you
explain
the
accident
that
happened
to
the
scotia
its
maybe




ned
said
hesitating
go
on
because



it
just
couldnt
be
true
the
canadian
replied
unconsciously
echoing
a
famous
catchphrase
of
the
scientist
arago
but
this
reply
proved
nothing
other
than
how
bullheaded
the
harpooner
could
be
that
day
i
pressed
him
no
further
the
scotias
accident
was
undeniable
its
hole
was
real
enough
that
it
had
to
be
plugged
up
and
i
dont
think
a
holes
existence
can
be
more
emphatically
proven
now
then
this
hole
didnt
make
itself
and
since
it
hadnt
resulted
from
underwater
rocks
or
underwater
machines
it
must
have
been
caused
by
the
perforating
tool
of
some
animal
now
for
all
the
reasons
put
forward
to
this
point
i
believed
that
this
animal
was
a
member
of
the
branch
vertebrata
class
mammalia
group
pisciforma
and
finally
order
cetacea
as
for
the
family
in
which
it
would
be
placed

or

the
genus
to
which
it
belonged
and
the
species
in
which
it
would
find
its
proper
home
these
questions
had
to
be
left
for
later
to
answer
them

chapter
5
at
random
for
some
while
the
voyage
of
the
abraham
lincoln
was
marked
by
no
incident
but
one
circumstance
arose
that
displayed
ned
lands
marvelous
skills
and
showed
just
how
much
confidence
we
could
place
in
him
off
the
falkland
islands
on
june
30
the
frigate
came
in
contact
with
a
fleet
of
american
whalers
and
we
learned
that
they
hadnt
seen
the
narwhale
but
one
of
them
the
captain
of
the
monroe
knew
that
ned
land
had
shipped
aboard
the
abraham
lincoln
and
asked
his
help
in
hunting
a
baleen
whale
that
was
in
sight
anxious
to
see
ned
land
at
work
commander
farragut
authorized
him
to
make
his
way
aboard
the
monroe
and
the
canadian
had
such
good
luck
that
with
a
rightandleft
shot
he
harpooned
not
one
whale
but
two
striking
the
first
straight
to
the
heart
and
catching
the
other
after
a
few
minutes
chase
assuredly
if
the
monster
ever
had
to
deal
with
ned
lands
harpoon
i
wouldnt
bet
on
the
monster
the
frigate
sailed
along
the
east
coast
of
south
america
with
prodigious
speed
by
july
3
we
were
at
the
entrance
to
the
strait
of
magellan
abreast
of
cabo
de
las
virgenes
but
commander
farragut
was
unwilling
to
attempt
this
tortuous
passageway
and
maneuvered
instead
to
double
cape
horn
the
crew
sided
with
him
unanimously
indeed
were
we
likely
to
encounter
the
narwhale
in
such
a
cramped
strait
many
of
our
sailors
swore
that
the
monster
couldnt
negotiate
this
passageway
simply
because
hes
too
big
for
it
near
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
on
july
6
fifteen
miles
south
of
shore
the
abraham
lincoln
doubled
that
solitary
islet
at
the
tip
of
the
south
american
continent
that
stray
rock
dutch
seamen
had
named
cape
horn
after
their
hometown
of
hoorn
our
course
was
set
for
the
northwest
and
the
next
day
our
frigates
propeller
finally
churned
the
waters
of
the
pacific
open
your
eyes
open
your
eyes
repeated
the
sailors
of
the
abraham
lincoln
and
they
opened
amazingly
wide
eyes
and
spyglasses
a
bit
dazzled
it
is
true
by
the
vista
of
200000
didnt
remain
at
rest
for
an
instant
day
and
night
we
observed
the
surface
of
the
ocean
and
those
with
nyctalopic
eyes
whose
ability
to
see
in
the
dark
increased
their
chances
by
fifty
percent
had
an
excellent
shot
at
winning
the
prize
as
for
me
i
was
hardly
drawn
by
the
lure
of
money
and
yet
was
far
from
the
least
attentive
on
board
snatching
only
a
few
minutes
for
meals
and
a
few
hours
for
sleep
come
rain
or
come
shine
i
no
longer
left
the
ships
deck
sometimes
bending
over
the
forecastle
railings
sometimes
leaning
against
the
sternrail
i
eagerly
scoured
that
cottoncolored
wake
that
whitened
the
ocean
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
and
how
many
times
i
shared
the
excitement
of
general
staff
and
crew
when
some
unpredictable
whale
lifted
its
blackish
back
above
the
waves
in
an
instant
the
frigates
deck
would
become
densely
populated
the
cowls
over
the
companionways
would
vomit
a
torrent
of
sailors
and
officers
with
panting
chests
and
anxious
eyes
we
each
would
observe
the
cetaceans
movements
i
stared
i
stared
until
i
nearly
went
blind
from
a
wornout
retina
while
conseil
as
stoic
as
ever
kept
repeating
to
me
in
a
calm
tone
if
masters
eyes
would
kindly
stop
bulging
master
will
see
farther
but
what
a
waste
of
energy
the
abraham
lincoln
would
change
course
and
race
after
the
animal
sighted
only
to
find
an
ordinary
baleen
whale
or
a
common
sperm
whale
that
soon
disappeared
amid
a
chorus
of
curses
however
the
weather
held
good
our
voyage
was
proceeding
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
by
then
it
was
the
bad
season
in
these
southernmost
regions
because
july
in
this
zone
corresponds
to
our
january
in
europe
but
the
sea
remained
smooth
and
easily
visible
over
a
vast
perimeter
ned
land
still
kept
up
the
most
tenacious
skepticism
beyond
his
spells
on
watch
he
pretended
that
he
never
even
looked
at
the
surface
of
the
waves
at
least
while
no
whales
were
in
sight
and
yet
the
marvelous
power
of
his
vision
could
have
performed
yeoman
service
but
this
stubborn
canadian
spent
eight
hours
out
of
every
twelve
reading
or
sleeping
in
his
cabin
a
hundred
times
i
chided
him
for
his
unconcern
bah
he
replied
nothings
out
there
professor
aronnax
and
if
there
is
some
animal
what
chance
would
we
have
of
spotting
it
cant
you
see
were
just
wandering
around
at
random
people
say
theyve
sighted
this
slippery
beast
again
in
the
pacific
high
seasim
truly
willing
to
believe
it
but
two
months
have
already
gone
by
since
then
and
judging
by
your
narwhales
personality
it
hates
growing
moldy
from
hanging
out
too
long
in
the
same
waterways
its
blessed
with
a
terrific
gift
for
getting
around
now
professor
you
know
even
better
than
i
that
nature
doesnt
violate
good
sense
and
she
wouldnt
give
some
naturally
slow
animal
the
ability
to
move
swiftly
if
it
hadnt
a
need
to
use
that
talent
so
if
the
beast
does
exist
its
already
long
gone
i
had
no
reply
to
this
obviously
we
were
just
groping
blindly
but
how
else
could
we
go
about
it
all
the
same
our
chances
were
automatically
pretty
limited
yet
everyone
still
felt
confident
of
success
and
not
a
sailor
on
board
would
have
bet
against
the
narwhale
appearing
and
soon
on
july
20
we
cut
the
tropic
of
capricorn
at
longitude
105
degrees
and
by
the
27th
of
the
same
month
we
had
cleared
the
equator
on
the
110th
meridian
these
bearings
determined
the
frigate
took
a
more
decisive
westward
heading
and
tackled
the
seas
of
the
central
pacific
commander
farragut
felt
and
with
good
reason
that
it
was
best
to
stay
in
deep
waters
and
keep
his
distance
from
continents
or
islands
whose
neighborhoods
the
animal
always
seemed
to
avoidno
doubt
our
bosun
said
because
there
isnt
enough
water
for
him
so
the
frigate
kept
well
out
when
passing
the
tuamotu
marquesas
and
hawaiian
islands
then
cut
the
tropic
of
cancer
at
longitude
132
degrees
and
headed
for
the
seas
of
china
we
were
finally
in
the
area
of
the
monsters
latest
antics
and
in
all
honesty
shipboard
conditions
became
lifethreatening
hearts
were
pounding
hideously
gearing
up
for
futures
full
of
incurable
aneurysms
the
entire
crew
suffered
from
a
nervous
excitement
that
its
beyond
me
to
describe
nobody
ate
nobody
slept
twenty
times
a
day
some
error
in
perception
or
the
optical
illusions
of
some
sailor
perched
in
the
crosstrees
would
cause
intolerable
anguish
and
this
emotion
repeated
twenty
times
over
kept
us
in
a
state
of
irritability
so
intense
that
a
reaction
was
bound
to
follow
and
this
reaction
wasnt
long
in
coming
for
three
months
during
which
each
day
seemed
like
a
century
the
abraham
lincoln
plowed
all
the
northerly
seas
of
the
pacific
racing
after
whales
sighted
abruptly
veering
off
course
swerving
sharply
from
one
tack
to
another
stopping
suddenly
putting
on
steam
and
reversing
engines
in
quick
succession
at
the
risk
of
stripping
its
gears
and
it
didnt
leave
a
single
point
unexplored
from
the
beaches
of
japan
to
the
coasts
of
america
and
we
found
nothing
nothing
except
an
immenseness
of
deserted
waves
nothing
remotely
resembling
a
gigantic
narwhale
or
an
underwater
islet
or
a
derelict
shipwreck
or
a
runaway
reef
or
anything
the
least
bit
unearthly
so
the
reaction
set
in
at
first
discouragement
took
hold
of
peoples
minds
opening
the
door
to
disbelief
a
new
feeling
appeared
on
board
made
up
of
threetenths
shame
and
seventenths
fury
the
crew
called
themselves
outandout
fools
for
being
hoodwinked
by
a
fairy
tale
then
grew
steadily
more
furious
the
mountains
of
arguments
amassed
over
a
year
collapsed
all
at
once
and
each
man
now
wanted
only
to
catch
up
on
his
eating
and
sleeping
to
make
up
for
the
time
he
had
so
stupidly
sacrificed
with
typical
human
fickleness
they
jumped
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
inevitably
the
most
enthusiastic
supporters
of
the
undertaking
became
its
most
energetic
opponents
this
reaction
mounted
upward
from
the
bowels
of
the
ship
from
the
quarters
of
the
bunker
hands
to
the
messroom
of
the
general
staff
and
for
certain
if
it
hadnt
been
for
commander
farraguts
characteristic
stubbornness
the
frigate
would
ultimately
have
put
back
to
that
cape
in
the
south
but
this
futile
search
couldnt
drag
on
much
longer
the
abraham
lincoln
had
done
everything
it
could
to
succeed
and
had
no
reason
to
blame
itself
never
had
the
crew
of
an
american
naval
craft
shown
more
patience
and
zeal
they
werent
responsible
for
this
failure
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
home
a
request
to
this
effect
was
presented
to
the
commander
the
commander
stood
his
ground
his
sailors
couldnt
hide
their
discontent
and
their
work
suffered
because
of
it
im
unwilling
to
say
that
there
was
mutiny
on
board
but
after
a
reasonable
period
of
intransigence
commander
farragut
like
christopher
columbus
before
him
asked
for
a
grace
period
of
just
three
days
more
after
this
threeday
delay
if
the
monster
hadnt
appeared
our
helmsman
would
give
three
turns
of
the
wheel
and
the
abraham
lincoln
would
chart
a
course
toward
european
seas
this
promise
was
given
on
november
2
it
had
the
immediate
effect
of
reviving
the
crews
failing
spirits
the
ocean
was
observed
with
renewed
care
each
man
wanted
one
last
look
with
which
to
sum
up
his
experience
spyglasses
functioned
with
feverish
energy
a
supreme
challenge
had
been
issued
to
the
giant
narwhale
and
the
latter
had
no
acceptable
excuse
for
ignoring
this
summons
to
appear
two
days
passed
the
abraham
lincoln
stayed
at
half
steam
on
the
offchance
that
the
animal
might
be
found
in
these
waterways
a
thousand
methods
were
used
to
spark
its
interest
or
rouse
it
from
its
apathy
enormous
sides
of
bacon
were
trailed
in
our
wake
to
the
great
satisfaction
i
must
say
of
assorted
sharks
while
the
abraham
lincoln
heaved
to
its
longboats
radiated
in
every
direction
around
it
and
didnt
leave
a
single
point
of
the
sea
unexplored
but
the
evening
of
november
4
arrived
with
this
underwater
mystery
still
unsolved
at
noon
the
next
day
november
5
the
agreedupon
delay
expired
after
a
position
fix
true
to
his
promise
commander
farragut
would
have
to
set
his
course
for
the
southeast
and
leave
the
northerly
regions
of
the
pacific
decisively
behind
by
then
the
frigate
lay
in
latitude
31
degrees
15
north
and
longitude
136
degrees
42
east
the
shores
of
japan
were
less
than
200
miles
to
our
leeward
night
was
coming
on
eight
oclock
had
just
struck
huge
clouds
covered
the
moons
disk
then
in
its
first
quarter
the
sea
undulated
placidly
beneath
the
frigates
stempost
just
then
i
was
in
the
bow
leaning
over
the
starboard
rail
conseil
stationed
beside
me
stared
straight
ahead
roosting
in
the
shrouds
the
crew
examined
the
horizon
which
shrank
and
darkened
little
by
little
officers
were
probing
the
increasing
gloom
with
their
night
glasses
sometimes
the
murky
ocean
sparkled
beneath
moonbeams
that
darted
between
the
fringes
of
two
clouds
then
all
traces
of
light
vanished
into
the
darkness
observing
conseil
i
discovered
that
just
barely
the
gallant
lad
had
fallen
under
the
general
influence
at
least
so
i
thought
perhaps
his
nerves
were
twitching
with
curiosity
for
the
first
time
in
history
come
on
conseil
i
told
him
heres
your
last
chance
to
pocket
that
200000
if
master
will
permit
my
saying
so
conseil
replied
i
never
expected
to
win
that
prize
and
the
union
government
could
have
promised
10000000
and
been
none
the
poorer
youre
right
conseil
it
turned
out
to
be
a
foolish
business
after
all
and
we
jumped
into
it
too
hastily
what
a
waste
of
time
what
a
futile
expense
of
emotion
six
months
ago
we
could
have
been
back
in
france
in
masters
little
apartment
conseil
answered
in
masters
museum
and
by
now
i
would
have
classified
masters
fossils
and
masters
babirusa
would
be
ensconced
in
its
cage
at
the
zoo
in
the
botanical
gardens
and
it
would
have
attracted
every
curiosity
seeker
in
town
quite
so
conseil
and
whats
more
i
imagine
that
people
will
soon
be
poking
fun
at
us
to
be
sure
conseil
replied
serenely
i
do
think
theyll
have
fun
at
masters
expense
and
must
it
be
said




it
must
be
said
conseil
well
then
it
will
serve
master
right
how
true
when
one
has
the
honor
of
being
an
expert
as
master
is
one
mustnt
lay
himself
open
to
conseil
didnt
have
time
to
complete
the
compliment
in
the
midst
of
the
general
silence
a
voice
became
audible
it
was
ned
lands
voice
and
it
shouted
ahoy
theres
the
thing
in
question
abreast
of
us
to
leeward
chapter
6
at
full
steam
at
this
shout
the
entire
crew
rushed
toward
the
harpoonercommander
officers
mates
sailors
cabin
boys
down
to
engineers
leaving
their
machinery
and
stokers
neglecting
their
furnaces
the
order
was
given
to
stop
and
the
frigate
merely
coasted
by
then
the
darkness
was
profound
and
as
good
as
the
canadians
eyes
were
i
still
wondered
how
he
could
seeand
what
he
had
seen
my
heart
was
pounding
fit
to
burst
but
ned
land
was
not
mistaken
and
we
all
spotted
the
object
his
hand
was
indicating
two
cable
lengths
off
the
abraham
lincolns
starboard
quarter
the
sea
seemed
to
be
lit
up
from
underneath
this
was
no
mere
phosphorescent
phenomenon
that
much
was
unmistakable
submerged
some
fathoms
below
the
surface
of
the
water
the
monster
gave
off
that
very
intense
but
inexplicable
glow
that
several
captains
had
mentioned
in
their
reports
this
magnificent
radiance
had
to
come
from
some
force
with
a
great
illuminating
capacity
the
edge
of
its
light
swept
over
the
sea
in
an
immense
highly
elongated
oval
condensing
at
the
center
into
a
blazing
core
whose
unbearable
glow
diminished
by
degrees
outward
its
only
a
cluster
of
phosphorescent
particles
exclaimed
one
of
the
officers
no
sir
i
answered
with
conviction
not
even
angelwing
clams
or
salps
have
ever
given
off
such
a
powerful
light
that
glow
is
basically
electric
in
nature
besides



look
look
its
shifting
its
moving
back
and
forth
its
darting
at
us
a
universal
shout
went
up
from
the
frigate
quiet
commander
farragut
said
helm
hard
to
leeward
reverse
engines
sailors
rushed
to
the
helm
engineers
to
their
machinery
under
reverse
steam
immediately
the
abraham
lincoln
beat
to
port
sweeping
in
a
semicircle
right
your
helm
engines
forward
commander
farragut
called
these
orders
were
executed
and
the
frigate
swiftly
retreated
from
this
core
of
light
my
mistake
it
wanted
to
retreat
but
the
unearthly
animal
came
at
us
with
a
speed
double
our
own
we
gasped
more
stunned
than
afraid
we
stood
mute
and
motionless
the
animal
caught
up
with
us
played
with
us
it
made
a
full
circle
around
the
frigatethen
doing
fourteen
knotsand
wrapped
us
in
sheets
of
electricity
that
were
like
luminous
dust
then
it
retreated
two
or
three
miles
leaving
a
phosphorescent
trail
comparable
to
those
swirls
of
steam
that
shoot
behind
the
locomotive
of
an
express
train
suddenly
all
the
way
from
the
dark
horizon
where
it
had
gone
to
gather
momentum
the
monster
abruptly
dashed
toward
the
abraham
lincoln
with
frightening
speed
stopped
sharply
twenty
feet
from
our
side
plates
and
died
outnot
by
diving
under
the
water
since
its
glow
did
not
recede
graduallybut
all
at
once
as
if
the
source
of
this
brilliant
emanation
had
suddenly
dried
up
then
it
reappeared
on
the
other
side
of
the
ship
either
by
circling
around
us
or
by
gliding
under
our
hull
at
any
instant
a
collision
could
have
occurred
that
would
have
been
fatal
to
us
meanwhile
i
was
astonished
at
the
frigates
maneuvers
it
was
fleeing
not
fighting
built
to
pursue
it
was
being
pursued
and
i
commented
on
this
to
commander
farragut
his
face
ordinarily
so
emotionless
was
stamped
with
indescribable
astonishment
professor
aronnax
he
answered
me
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
fearsome
creature
im
up
against
and
i
dont
want
my
frigate
running
foolish
risks
in
all
this
darkness
besides
how
should
we
attack
this
unknown
creature
how
should
we
defend
ourselves
against
it
lets
wait
for
daylight
and
then
well
play
a
different
role
youve
no
further
doubts
commander
as
to
the
nature
of
this
animal
no
sir
its
apparently
a
gigantic
narwhale
and
an
electric
one
to
boot
maybe
i
added
its
no
more
approachable
than
an
electric
eel
or
an
electric
ray
right
the
commander
replied
and
if
it
has
their
power
to
electrocute
its
surely
the
most
dreadful
animal
ever
conceived
by
our
creator
thats
why
ill
keep
on
my
guard
sir
the
whole
crew
stayed
on
their
feet
all
night
long
no
one
even
thought
of
sleeping
unable
to
compete
with
the
monsters
speed
the
abraham
lincoln
slowed
down
and
stayed
at
half
steam
for
its
part
the
narwhale
mimicked
the
frigate
simply
rode
with
the
waves
and
seemed
determined
not
to
forsake
the
field
of
battle
however
near
midnight
it
disappeared
or
to
use
a
more
appropriate
expression
it
went
out
like
a
huge
glowworm
had
it
fled
from
us
we
were
duty
bound
to
fear
so
rather
than
hope
so
but
at
1253
in
the
morning
a
deafening
hiss
became
audible
resembling
the
sound
made
by
a
waterspout
expelled
with
tremendous
intensity
by
then
commander
farragut
ned
land
and
i
were
on
the
afterdeck
peering
eagerly
into
the
profound
gloom
ned
land
the
commander
asked
youve
often
heard
whales
bellowing
often
sir
but
never
a
whale
like
this
whose
sighting
earned
me
200000
correct
the
prize
is
rightfully
yours
but
tell
me
isnt
that
the
noise
cetaceans
make
when
they
spurt
water
from
their
blowholes
the
very
noise
sir
but
this
ones
way
louder
so
there
can
be
no
mistake
theres
definitely
a
whale
lurking
in
our
waters
with
your
permission
sir
the
harpooner
added
tomorrow
at
daybreak
well
have
words
with
it
if
its
in
a
mood
to
listen
to
you
mr
land
i
replied
in
a
tone
far
from
convinced
let
me
get
within
four
harpoon
lengths
of
it
the
canadian
shot
back
and
it
had
better
listen
but
to
get
near
it
the
commander
went
on
id
have
to
put
a
whaleboat
at
your
disposal
certainly
sir
that
would
be
gambling
with
the
lives
of
my
men
and
with
my
own
the
harpooner
replied
simply
near
two
oclock
in
the
morning
the
core
of
light
reappeared
no
less
intense
five
miles
to
windward
of
the
abraham
lincoln
despite
the
distance
despite
the
noise
of
wind
and
sea
we
could
distinctly
hear
the
fearsome
thrashings
of
the
animals
tail
and
even
its
panting
breath
seemingly
the
moment
this
enormous
narwhale
came
up
to
breathe
at
the
surface
of
the
ocean
air
was
sucked
into
its
lungs
like
steam
into
the
huge
cylinders
of
a
2000horsepower
engine
hmm
i
said
to
myself
a
cetacean
as
powerful
as
a
whole
cavalry
regimentnow
thats
a
whale
of
a
whale
we
stayed
on
the
alert
until
daylight
getting
ready
for
action
whaling
gear
was
set
up
along
the
railings
our
chief
officer
loaded
the
blunderbusses
which
can
launch
harpoons
as
far
as
a
mile
and
long
duck
guns
with
exploding
bullets
that
can
mortally
wound
even
the
most
powerful
animals
ned
land
was
content
to
sharpen
his
harpoon
a
dreadful
weapon
in
his
hands
at
six
oclock
day
began
to
break
and
with
the
dawns
early
light
the
narwhales
electric
glow
disappeared
at
seven
oclock
the
day
was
well
along
but
a
very
dense
morning
mist
shrank
the
horizon
and
our
best
spyglasses
were
unable
to
pierce
it
the
outcome
disappointment
and
anger
i
hoisted
myself
up
to
the
crosstrees
of
the
mizzen
sail
some
officers
were
already
perched
on
the
mastheads
at
eight
oclock
the
mist
rolled
ponderously
over
the
waves
and
its
huge
curls
were
lifting
little
by
little
the
horizon
grew
wider
and
clearer
all
at
once
suddenly
just
as
on
the
previous
evening
ned
lands
voice
was
audible
theres
the
thing
in
question
astern
to
port
the
harpooner
shouted
every
eye
looked
toward
the
point
indicated
there
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
frigate
a
long
blackish
body
emerged
a
meter
above
the
waves
quivering
violently
its
tail
was
creating
a
considerable
eddy
never
had
caudal
equipment
thrashed
the
sea
with
such
power
an
immense
wake
of
glowing
whiteness
marked
the
animals
track
sweeping
in
a
long
curve
our
frigate
drew
nearer
to
the
cetacean
i
examined
it
with
a
completely
open
mind
those
reports
from
the
shannon
and
the
helvetia
had
slightly
exaggerated
its
dimensions
and
i
put
its
length
at
only
250
feet
its
girth
was
more
difficult
to
judge
but
all
in
all
the
animal
seemed
to
be
wonderfully
proportioned
in
all
three
dimensions
while
i
was
observing
this
phenomenal
creature
two
jets
of
steam
and
water
sprang
from
its
blowholes
and
rose
to
an
altitude
of
forty
meters
which
settled
for
me
its
mode
of
breathing
from
this
i
finally
concluded
that
it
belonged
to
the
branch
vertebrata
class
mammalia
subclass
monodelphia
group
pisciforma
order
cetacea
family



but
here
i
couldnt
make
up
my
mind
the
order
cetacea
consists
of
three
families
baleen
whales
sperm
whales
dolphins
and
its
in
this
last
group
that
narwhales
are
placed
each
of
these
families
is
divided
into
several
genera
each
genus
into
species
each
species
into
varieties
so
i
was
still
missing
variety
species
genus
and
family
but
no
doubt
i
would
complete
my
classifying
with
the
aid
of
heaven
and
commander
farragut
the
crew
were
waiting
impatiently
for
orders
from
their
leader
the
latter
after
carefully
observing
the
animal
called
for
his
engineer
the
engineer
raced
over
sir
the
commander
said
are
you
up
to
pressure
aye
sir
the
engineer
replied
fine
stoke
your
furnaces
and
clap
on
full
steam
three
cheers
greeted
this
order
the
hour
of
battle
had
sounded
a
few
moments
later
the
frigates
two
funnels
vomited
torrents
of
black
smoke
and
its
deck
quaked
from
the
trembling
of
its
boilers
driven
forward
by
its
powerful
propeller
the
abraham
lincoln
headed
straight
for
the
animal
unconcerned
the
latter
let
us
come
within
half
a
cable
length
then
not
bothering
to
dive
it
got
up
a
little
speed
retreated
and
was
content
to
keep
its
distance
this
chase
dragged
on
for
about
threequarters
of
an
hour
without
the
frigate
gaining
two
fathoms
on
the
cetacean
at
this
rate
it
was
obvious
that
we
would
never
catch
up
with
it
infuriated
commander
farragut
kept
twisting
the
thick
tuft
of
hair
that
flourished
below
his
chin
ned
land
he
called
the
canadian
reported
at
once
well
mr
land
the
commander
asked
do
you
still
advise
putting
my
longboats
to
sea
no
sir
ned
land
replied
because
that
beast
wont
be
caught
against
its
will
then
what
should
we
do
stoke
up
more
steam
sir
if
you
can
as
for
me
with
your
permission
ill
go
perch
on
the
bobstays
under
the
bowsprit
and
if
we
can
get
within
a
harpoon
length
ill
harpoon
the
brute
go
to
it
ned
commander
farragut
replied
engineer
he
called
keep
the
pressure
mounting
ned
land
made
his
way
to
his
post
the
furnaces
were
urged
into
greater
activity
our
propeller
did
fortythree
revolutions
per
minute
and
steam
shot
from
the
valves
heaving
the
log
we
verified
that
the
abraham
lincoln
was
going
at
the
rate
of
185
miles
per
hour
but
that
damned
animal
also
did
a
speed
of
185
for
the
next
hour
our
frigate
kept
up
this
pace
without
gaining
a
fathom
this
was
humiliating
for
one
of
the
fastest
racers
in
the
american
navy
the
crew
were
working
up
into
a
blind
rage
sailor
after
sailor
heaved
insults
at
the
monster
which
couldnt
be
bothered
with
answering
back
commander
farragut
was
no
longer
content
simply
to
twist
his
goatee
he
chewed
on
it
the
engineer
was
summoned
once
again
youre
up
to
maximum
pressure
the
commander
asked
him
aye
sir
the
engineer
replied
and
your
valves
are
charged
to




to
six
and
a
half
atmospheres
charge
them
to
ten
atmospheres
a
typical
american
order
if
i
ever
heard
one
it
would
have
sounded
just
fine
during
some
mississippi
paddlewheeler
race
to
outstrip
the
competition
conseil
i
said
to
my
gallant
servant
now
at
my
side
you
realize
that
well
probably
blow
ourselves
skyhigh
as
master
wishes
conseil
replied
all
right
i
admit
it
i
did
wish
to
run
this
risk
the
valves
were
charged
more
coal
was
swallowed
by
the
furnaces
ventilators
shot
torrents
of
air
over
the
braziers
the
abraham
lincolns
speed
increased
its
masts
trembled
down
to
their
blocks
and
swirls
of
smoke
could
barely
squeeze
through
the
narrow
funnels
we
heaved
the
log
a
second
time
well
helmsman
commander
farragut
asked
193
miles
per
hour
sir
keep
stoking
the
furnaces
the
engineer
did
so
the
pressure
gauge
marked
ten
atmospheres
but
no
doubt
the
cetacean
itself
had
warmed
up
because
without
the
least
trouble
it
also
did
193
what
a
chase
no
i
cant
describe
the
excitement
that
shook
my
very
being
ned
land
stayed
at
his
post
harpoon
in
hand
several
times
the
animal
let
us
approach
were
overhauling
it
the
canadian
would
shout
then
just
as
he
was
about
to
strike
the
cetacean
would
steal
off
with
a
swiftness
i
could
estimate
at
no
less
than
thirty
miles
per
hour
and
even
at
our
maximum
speed
it
took
the
liberty
of
thumbing
its
nose
at
the
frigate
by
running
a
full
circle
around
us
a
howl
of
fury
burst
from
every
throat
by
noon
we
were
no
farther
along
than
at
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
commander
farragut
then
decided
to
use
more
direct
methods
bah
he
said
so
that
animal
is
faster
than
the
abraham
lincoln
all
right
well
see
if
it
can
outrun
our
conical
shells
mate
man
the
gun
in
the
bow
our
forecastle
cannon
was
immediately
loaded
and
leveled
the
cannoneer
fired
a
shot
but
his
shell
passed
some
feet
above
the
cetacean
which
stayed
half
a
mile
off
over
to
somebody
with
better
aim
the
commander
shouted
and
50000
to
the
man
who
can
pierce
that
infernal
beast
calm
of
eye
cool
of
feature
an
old
graybearded
gunneri
can
see
him
to
this
dayapproached
the
cannon
put
it
in
position
and
took
aim
for
a
good
while
there
was
a
mighty
explosion
mingled
with
cheers
from
the
crew
the
shell
reached
its
target
it
hit
the
animal
but
not
in
the
usual
fashionit
bounced
off
that
rounded
surface
and
vanished
into
the
sea
two
miles
out
oh
drat
said
the
old
gunner
in
his
anger
that
rascal
must
be
covered
with
sixinch
armor
plate
curse
the
beast
commander
farragut
shouted
the
hunt
was
on
again
and
commander
farragut
leaned
over
to
me
saying
ill
chase
that
animal
till
my
frigate
explodes
yes
i
replied
and
nobody
would
blame
you
we
could
still
hope
that
the
animal
would
tire
out
and
not
be
as
insensitive
to
exhaustion
as
our
steam
engines
but
no
such
luck
hour
after
hour
went
by
without
it
showing
the
least
sign
of
weariness
however
to
the
abraham
lincolns
credit
it
must
be
said
that
we
struggled
on
with
tireless
persistence
i
estimate
that
we
covered
a
distance
of
at
least
500
kilometers
during
this
illfated
day
of
november
6
but
night
fell
and
wrapped
the
surging
ocean
in
its
shadows
by
then
i
thought
our
expedition
had
come
to
an
end
that
we
would
never
see
this
fantastic
animal
again
i
was
mistaken
at
1050
in
the
evening
that
electric
light
reappeared
three
miles
to
windward
of
the
frigate
just
as
clear
and
intense
as
the
night
before
the
narwhale
seemed
motionless
was
it
asleep
perhaps
weary
from
its
workday
just
riding
with
the
waves
this
was
our
chance
and
commander
farragut
was
determined
to
take
full
advantage
of
it
he
gave
his
orders
the
abraham
lincoln
stayed
at
half
steam
advancing
cautiously
so
as
not
to
awaken
its
adversary
in
midocean
its
not
unusual
to
encounter
whales
so
sound
asleep
they
can
successfully
be
attacked
and
ned
land
had
harpooned
more
than
one
in
its
slumber
the
canadian
went
to
resume
his
post
on
the
bobstays
under
the
bowsprit
the
frigate
approached
without
making
a
sound
stopped
two
cable
lengths
from
the
animal
and
coasted
not
a
soul
breathed
on
board
a
profound
silence
reigned
over
the
deck
we
were
not
100
feet
from
the
blazing
core
of
light
whose
glow
grew
stronger
and
dazzled
the
eyes
just
then
leaning
over
the
forecastle
railing
i
saw
ned
land
below
me
one
hand
grasping
the
martingale
the
other
brandishing
his
dreadful
harpoon
barely
twenty
feet
separated
him
from
the
motionless
animal
all
at
once
his
arm
shot
forward
and
the
harpoon
was
launched
i
heard
the
weapon
collide
resonantly
as
if
it
had
hit
some
hard
substance
the
electric
light
suddenly
went
out
and
two
enormous
waterspouts
crashed
onto
the
deck
of
the
frigate
racing
like
a
torrent
from
stem
to
stern
toppling
crewmen
breaking
spare
masts
and
yardarms
from
their
lashings
a
hideous
collision
occurred
and
thrown
over
the
rail
with
no
time
to
catch
hold
of
it
i
was
hurled
into
the
sea
chapter
7
a
whale
of
unknown
species
although
i
was
startled
by
this
unexpected
descent
i
at
least
have
a
very
clear
recollection
of
my
sensations
during
it
at
first
i
was
dragged
about
twenty
feet
under
im
a
good
swimmer
without
claiming
to
equal
such
other
authors
as
byron
and
edgar
allan
poe
who
were
master
divers
and
i
didnt
lose
my
head
on
the
way
down
with
two
vigorous
kicks
of
the
heel
i
came
back
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
my
first
concern
was
to
look
for
the
frigate
had
the
crew
seen
me
go
overboard
was
the
abraham
lincoln
tacking
about
would
commander
farragut
put
a
longboat
to
sea
could
i
hope
to
be
rescued
the
gloom
was
profound
i
glimpsed
a
black
mass
disappearing
eastward
where
its
running
lights
were
fading
out
in
the
distance
it
was
the
frigate
i
felt
i
was
done
for
help
help
i
shouted
swimming
desperately
toward
the
abraham
lincoln
my
clothes
were
weighing
me
down
the
water
glued
them
to
my
body
they
were
paralyzing
my
movements
i
was
sinking
i
was
suffocating




help
this
was
the
last
shout
i
gave
my
mouth
was
filling
with
water
i
struggled
against
being
dragged
into
the
depths



suddenly
my
clothes
were
seized
by
energetic
hands
i
felt
myself
pulled
abruptly
back
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
yes
i
heard
these
words
pronounced
in
my
ear
if
master
would
oblige
me
by
leaning
on
my
shoulder
master
will
swim
with
much
greater
ease
with
one
hand
i
seized
the
arm
of
my
loyal
conseil
you
i
said
you
myself
conseil
replied
and
at
masters
command
that
collision
threw
you
overboard
along
with
me
not
at
all
but
being
in
masters
employ
i
followed
master
the
fine
lad
thought
this
only
natural
what
about
the
frigate
i
asked
the
frigate
conseil
replied
rolling
over
on
his
back
i
think
master
had
best
not
depend
on
it
to
any
great
extent
what
are
you
saying
im
saying
that
just
as
i
jumped
overboard
i
heard
the
men
at
the
helm
shout
our
propeller
and
rudder
are
smashed

smashed
yes
smashed
by
the
monsters
tusk
i
believe
its
the
sole
injury
the
abraham
lincoln
has
sustained
but
most
inconveniently
for
us
the
ship
can
no
longer
steer
then
were
done
for
perhaps
conseil
replied
serenely
however
we
still
have
a
few
hours
before
us
and
in
a
few
hours
one
can
do
a
great
many
things
conseils
unflappable
composure
cheered
me
up
i
swam
more
vigorously
but
hampered
by
clothes
that
were
as
restricting
as
a
cloak
made
of
lead
i
was
managing
with
only
the
greatest
difficulty
conseil
noticed
as
much
master
will
allow
me
to
make
an
incision
he
said
and
he
slipped
an
open
clasp
knife
under
my
clothes
slitting
them
from
top
to
bottom
with
one
swift
stroke
then
he
briskly
undressed
me
while
i
swam
for
us
both
i
then
did
conseil
the
same
favor
and
we
continued
to
navigate
side
by
side
but
our
circumstances
were
no
less
dreadful
perhaps
they
hadnt
seen
us
go
overboard
and
even
if
they
had
the
frigatebeing
undone
by
its
ruddercouldnt
return
to
leeward
after
us
so
we
could
count
only
on
its
longboats
conseil
had
coolly
reasoned
out
this
hypothesis
and
laid
his
plans
accordingly
an
amazing
character
this
boy
in
midocean
this
stoic
lad
seemed
right
at
home
so
having
concluded
that
our
sole
chance
for
salvation
lay
in
being
picked
up
by
the
abraham
lincolns
longboats
we
had
to
take
steps
to
wait
for
them
as
long
as
possible
consequently
i
decided
to
divide
our
energies
so
we
wouldnt
both
be
worn
out
at
the
same
time
and
this
was
the
arrangement
while
one
of
us
lay
on
his
back
staying
motionless
with
arms
crossed
and
legs
outstretched
the
other
would
swim
and
propel
his
partner
forward
this
towing
role
was
to
last
no
longer
than
ten
minutes
and
by
relieving
each
other
in
this
way
we
could
stay
afloat
for
hours
perhaps
even
until
daybreak
slim
chance
but
hope
springs
eternal
in
the
human
breast
besides
there
were
two
of
us
lastly
i
can
vouchas
improbable
as
it
seemsthat
even
if
i
had
wanted
to
destroy
all
my
illusions
even
if
i
had
been
willing
to
give
in
to
despair
i
could
not
have
done
so
the
cetacean
had
rammed
our
frigate
at
about
eleven
oclock
in
the
evening
i
therefore
calculated
on
eight
hours
of
swimming
until
sunrise
a
strenuous
task
but
feasible
thanks
to
our
relieving
each
other
the
sea
was
pretty
smooth
and
barely
tired
us
sometimes
i
tried
to
peer
through
the
dense
gloom
which
was
broken
only
by
the
phosphorescent
flickers
coming
from
our
movements
i
stared
at
the
luminous
ripples
breaking
over
my
hands
shimmering
sheets
spattered
with
blotches
of
bluish
gray
it
seemed
as
if
wed
plunged
into
a
pool
of
quicksilver
near
one
oclock
in
the
morning
i
was
overcome
with
tremendous
exhaustion
my
limbs
stiffened
in
the
grip
of
intense
cramps
conseil
had
to
keep
me
going
and
attending
to
our
selfpreservation
became
his
sole
responsibility
i
soon
heard
the
poor
lad
gasping
his
breathing
became
shallow
and
quick
i
didnt
think
he
could
stand
such
exertions
for
much
longer
go
on
go
on
i
told
him
leave
master
behind
he
replied
never
ill
drown
before
he
does
just
then
past
the
fringes
of
a
large
cloud
that
the
wind
was
driving
eastward
the
moon
appeared
the
surface
of
the
sea
glistened
under
its
rays
that
kindly
light
rekindled
our
strength
i
held
up
my
head
again
my
eyes
darted
to
every
point
of
the
horizon
i
spotted
the
frigate
it
was
five
miles
from
us
and
formed
no
more
than
a
dark
barely
perceptible
mass
but
as
for
longboats
not
a
one
in
sight
i
tried
to
call
out
what
was
the
use
at
such
a
distance
my
swollen
lips
wouldnt
let
a
single
sound
through
conseil
could
still
articulate
a
few
words
and
i
heard
him
repeat
at
intervals
help
help
ceasing
all
movement
for
an
instant
we
listened
and
it
may
have
been
a
ringing
in
my
ear
from
this
organ
filling
with
impeded
blood
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
conseils
shout
had
received
an
answer
back
did
you
hear
that
i
muttered
yes
yes
and
conseil
hurled
another
desperate
plea
into
space
this
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
a
human
voice
had
answered
us
was
it
the
voice
of
some
poor
devil
left
behind
in
midocean
some
other
victim
of
that
collision
suffered
by
our
ship
or
was
it
one
of
the
frigates
longboats
hailing
us
out
of
the
gloom
conseil
made
one
final
effort
and
bracing
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
while
i
offered
resistance
with
one
supreme
exertion
he
raised
himself
half
out
of
the
water
then
fell
back
exhausted
what
did
you
see
i
saw




he
muttered
i
saw



but
we
mustnt
talk



save
our
strength




what
had
he
seen
then
lord
knows
why
the
thought
of
the
monster
came
into
my
head
for
the
first
time




but
even
so
that
voice




gone
are
the
days
when
jonahs
took
refuge
in
the
bellies
of
whales
nevertheless
conseil
kept
towing
me
sometimes
he
looked
up
stared
straight
ahead
and
shouted
a
request
for
directions
which
was
answered
by
a
voice
that
was
getting
closer
and
closer
i
could
barely
hear
it
i
was
at
the
end
of
my
strength
my
fingers
gave
out
my
hands
were
no
help
to
me
my
mouth
opened
convulsively
filling
with
brine
its
coldness
ran
through
me
i
raised
my
head
one
last
time
then
i
collapsed



just
then
something
hard
banged
against
me
i
clung
to
it
then
i
felt
myself
being
pulled
upward
back
to
the
surface
of
the
water
my
chest
caved
in
and
i
fainted



for
certain
i
came
to
quickly
because
someone
was
massaging
me
so
vigorously
it
left
furrows
in
my
flesh
i
half
opened
my
eyes



conseil
i
muttered
did
master
ring
for
me
conseil
replied
just
then
in
the
last
light
of
a
moon
settling
on
the
horizon
i
spotted
a
face
that
wasnt
conseils
but
which
i
recognized
at
once
ned
i
exclaimed
in
person
sir
and
still
after
his
prize
the
canadian
replied
you
were
thrown
overboard
after
the
frigates
collision
yes
professor
but
i
was
luckier
than
you
and
right
away
i
was
able
to
set
foot
on
this
floating
islet
islet
or
in
other
words
on
our
gigantic
narwhale
explain
yourself
ned
its
just
that
i
soon
realized
why
my
harpoon
got
blunted
and
couldnt
puncture
its
hide
why
ned
why
because
professor
this
beast
is
made
of
boilerplate
steel
at
this
point
in
my
story
i
need
to
get
a
grip
on
myself
reconstruct
exactly
what
i
experienced
and
make
doubly
sure
of
everything
i
write
the
canadians
last
words
caused
a
sudden
upheaval
in
my
brain
i
swiftly
hoisted
myself
to
the
summit
of
this
halfsubmerged
creature
or
object
that
was
serving
as
our
refuge
i
tested
it
with
my
foot
obviously
it
was
some
hard
impenetrable
substance
not
the
soft
matter
that
makes
up
the
bodies
of
our
big
marine
mammals
but
this
hard
substance
could
have
been
a
bony
carapace
like
those
that
covered
some
prehistoric
animals
and
i
might
have
left
it
at
that
and
classified
this
monster
among
such
amphibious
reptiles
as
turtles
or
alligators
well
no
the
blackish
back
supporting
me
was
smooth
and
polished
with
no
overlapping
scales
on
impact
it
gave
off
a
metallic
sonority
and
as
incredible
as
this
sounds
it
seemed
i
swear
to
be
made
of
riveted
plates
no
doubts
were
possible
this
animal
this
monster
this
natural
phenomenon
that
had
puzzled
the
whole
scientific
world
that
had
muddled
and
misled
the
minds
of
seamen
in
both
hemispheres
was
there
could
be
no
escaping
it
an
even
more
astonishing
phenomenona
phenomenon
made
by
the
hand
of
man
even
if
i
had
discovered
that
some
fabulous
mythological
creature
really
existed
it
wouldnt
have
given
me
such
a
terrific
mental
jolt
its
easy
enough
to
accept
that
prodigious
things
can
come
from
our
creator
but
to
find
all
at
once
right
before
your
eyes
that
the
impossible
had
been
mysteriously
achieved
by
man
himself
this
staggers
the
mind
but
there
was
no
question
now
we
were
stretched
out
on
the
back
of
some
kind
of
underwater
boat
that
as
far
as
i
could
judge
boasted
the
shape
of
an
immense
steel
fish
ned
land
had
clear
views
on
the
issue
conseil
and
i
could
only
line
up
behind
him
but
then
i
said
does
this
contraption
contain
some
sort
of
locomotive
mechanism
and
a
crew
to
run
it
apparently
the
harpooner
replied
and
yet
for
the
three
hours
ive
lived
on
this
floating
island
it
hasnt
shown
a
sign
of
life
this
boat
hasnt
moved
at
all
no
professor
aronnax
it
just
rides
with
the
waves
but
otherwise
it
hasnt
stirred
but
we
know
that
its
certainly
gifted
with
great
speed
now
then
since
an
engine
is
needed
to
generate
that
speed
and
a
mechanic
to
run
that
engine
i
conclude
were
saved
humph
ned
land
put
in
his
tone
denoting
reservations
just
then
as
if
to
take
my
side
in
the
argument
a
bubbling
began
astern
of
this
strange
submersiblewhose
drive
mechanism
was
obviously
a
propellerand
the
boat
started
to
move
we
barely
had
time
to
hang
on
to
its
topside
which
emerged
about
eighty
centimeters
above
water
fortunately
its
speed
was
not
excessive
so
long
as
it
navigates
horizontally
ned
land
muttered
ive
no
complaints
but
if
it
gets
the
urge
to
dive
i
wouldnt
give
200
for
my
hide
the
canadian
might
have
quoted
a
much
lower
price
so
it
was
imperative
to
make
contact
with
whatever
beings
were
confined
inside
the
plating
of
this
machine
i
searched
its
surface
for
an
opening
or
a
hatch
a
manhole
to
use
the
official
term
but
the
lines
of
rivets
had
been
firmly
driven
into
the
sheetiron
joins
and
were
straight
and
uniform
moreover
the
moon
then
disappeared
and
left
us
in
profound
darkness
we
had
to
wait
for
daylight
to
find
some
way
of
getting
inside
this
underwater
boat
so
our
salvation
lay
totally
in
the
hands
of
the
mysterious
helmsmen
steering
this
submersible
and
if
it
made
a
dive
we
were
done
for
but
aside
from
this
occurring
i
didnt
doubt
the
possibility
of
our
making
contact
with
them
in
fact
if
they
didnt
produce
their
own
air
they
inevitably
had
to
make
periodic
visits
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
to
replenish
their
oxygen
supply
hence
the
need
for
some
opening

for
any
hope
of
being
rescued
by
commander
farragut
that
had
to
be
renounced
completely
we
were
being
swept
westward
and
i
estimate
that
our
comparatively
moderate
speed
reached
twelve
miles
per
hour
the
propeller
churned
the
waves
with
mathematical
regularity
sometimes
emerging
above
the
surface
and
throwing
phosphorescent
spray
to
great
heights
near
four
oclock
in
the
morning
the
submersible
picked
up
speed
we
could
barely
cope
with
this
dizzying
rush
and
the
waves
battered
us
at
close
range
fortunately

hands
came
across
a
big
mooring
ring
fastened
to
the
topside
of
this

and
we
all
held
on
for
dear
life
finally
this
long
night
was

my
imperfect
memories

let
me
recall
my
every
impression
of

single
detail
comes
back
to
me
several
times
during
various
lulls
of
wind
and
sea
i
thought
i
heard
indistinct
sounds
a
sort
of
elusive
harmony
produced
by
distant
musical
chords
what
was
the
secret
behind
this
underwater
navigating
whose
explanation
the
whole
world
had
sought
in
vain
what
beings
lived
inside
this
strange
boat
what
mechanical
force
allowed
it
to
move
about
with
such
prodigious
speed
daylight
appeared
the
morning
mists
surrounded
us
but
they
soon
broke
up
i
was
about
to
proceed
with
a
careful
examination
of
the
hull
whose
topside
formed
a
sort
of
horizontal
platform
when
i
felt

but
it
was
difficult
to
make
yourself
heard
above
the
deafening
beats
of
the
propeller
fortunately
this
submerging
movement
stopped
from
inside
the
boat
there
suddenly
came
noises
of
iron
fastenings
pushed
roughly
aside
one
of
the
steel
plates
flew
up
a
man
appeared
gave
a
bizarre
yell
and
instantly
disappeared
a
few
moments
later
eight
strapping
fellows
appeared
silently
their
faces
like
masks
and
dragged
us
down
into
their
fearsome
machine

this
brutally
executed
capture
was
carried
out
with
lightning
speed
my
companions
and
i
had
no
time
to
collect
ourselves
i
dont
know
how
they
felt
about
being
shoved
inside
this
aquatic
prison
but
as
for
me
i
was
shivering
all
over
with
whom
were
we
dealing
surely
with
some
new
breed
of
pirates
exploiting
the
sea
after
their
own
fashion
the
narrow
hatch
had
barely
closed
over
me
when
i
was
surrounded
by
profound
darkness
saturated
with
the
outside
light
my
eyes
couldnt
make
out
a
thing
i
felt
my
naked
feet
clinging
to
the
steps
of
an
iron
ladder
forcibly
seized
ned
land
and
conseil
were
behind
me
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
a
door
opened
and
instantly
closed
behind
us
with
a
loud
clang
we
were
alone
where
i
couldnt
say
could
barely
even
imagine
all
was
darkness
but
such
utter
darkness
that
after
several
minutes
my
eyes
were
still
unable
to
catch
a
single
one
of
those
hazy
gleams
that
drift
through
even
the
blackest
nights
meanwhile
furious
at
these
goings
on
ned
land
gave
free
rein
to
his
indignation

he
exclaimed

all
thats
lacking
is

wouldnt

they
were

believe
you

lets
try
to
find
out
where
we
are
i
started
moving
groping
my
way
after
five
steps
i
encountered
an
iron
wall
made
of
riveted
boilerplate
then
turning
around
i
bumped
into
a
wooden
table
next
to
which
several
stools
had
been
set
the
floor
of
this
prison
lay
hidden
beneath
thick
hempen
matting
that
deadened
the
sound
of
footsteps
its
naked
walls
didnt
reveal
any
trace
of
a
door
or
window
going
around
the
opposite
way
conseil
met
up
with
me
and
we
returned
to
the
middle
of
this
cabin
which
had
to
be
twenty
feet
long
by
ten
wide
as
for
its
height
not
even
ned
land
with
his
great
stature
was
able
to
determine
it
half
an
hour
had
already
gone
by
without
our
situation
changing
when
our
eyes
were
suddenly
spirited
from
utter
darkness
into
blinding
light
our
prison
lit
up
all
at
once
in
other
words
it
filled
with
luminescent
matter
so
intense
that
at
first
i
couldnt
stand
the
brightness
of
it
from
its
glare
and
whiteness
i
recognized
the
electric
glow
that
had
played
around
this
underwater
boat
like
some
magnificent
phosphorescent
phenomenon
after
involuntarily
closing
my
eyes
i
reopened
them
and
saw
that
this
luminous
force
came
from
a
frosted
half
globe
curving
out
of
the
cabins
ceiling
finally
its
light
enough
to
see
ned
land
exclaimed
knife
in
hand
staying
on
the
defensive
yes
i
replied
then
ventured
the
opposite
view
but
as
for
our
situation
were
still
in
the
dark
master
must
learn
patience
said
the
emotionless
conseil
this
sudden
illumination
of
our
cabin
enabled
me
to
examine
its
tiniest
details
it
contained
only
a
table
and
five
stools
its
invisible
door
must
have
been
hermetically
sealed
not
a
sound
reached
our
ears
everything
seemed
dead
inside
this
boat
was
it
in
motion
or
stationary
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
or
sinking
into
the
depths
i
couldnt
tell
but
this
luminous
globe
hadnt
been
turned
on
without
good
reason
consequently
i
hoped
that
some
crewmen
would
soon
make
an
appearance
if
you
want
to
consign
people
to
oblivion
you
dont
light
up
their
dungeons
i
was
not
mistaken
unlocking
noises
became
audible
a
door
opened
and
two
men
appeared
one
was
short
and
stocky
powerfully
muscled
broad
shouldered
robust
of
limbs
the
head
squat
the
hair
black
and
luxuriant
the
mustache
heavy
the
eyes
bright
and
penetrating
and
his
whole
personality
stamped
with
that
southernblooded
zest
that
in
france
typifies
the
people
of
provence
the
philosopher
diderot
has
very
aptly
claimed
that
a
mans
bearing
is
the
clue
to
his
character
and
this
stocky
little
man
was
certainly
a
living
proof
of
this
claim
you
could
sense
that
his
everyday
conversation
must
have
been
packed
with
such
vivid
figures
of
speech
as
personification
symbolism
and
misplaced
modifiers
but
i
was
never
in
a
position
to
verify
this
because
around
me
he
used
only
an
odd
and
utterly
incomprehensible
dialect
the
second
stranger
deserves
a
more
detailed
description
a
disciple
of
such
characterjudging
anatomists
as
gratiolet
or
engel
could
have
read
this
mans
features
like
an
open
book
without
hesitation
i
identified
his
dominant
qualitiesselfconfidence
since
his
head
reared
like
a
noblemans
above
the
arc
formed
by
the
lines
of
his
shoulders
and
his
black
eyes
gazed
with
icy
assurance
calmness
since
his
skin
pale
rather
than
ruddy
indicated
tranquility
of
blood
energy
shown
by
the
swiftly
knitting
muscles
of
his
brow
and
finally
courage
since
his
deep
breathing
denoted
tremendous
reserves
of
vitality
i
might
add
that
this
was
a
man
of
great
pride
that
his
calm
firm
gaze
seemed
to
reflect
thinking
on
an
elevated
plane
and
that
the
harmony
of
his
facial
expressions
and
bodily
movements
resulted
in
an
overall
effect
of
unquestionable
candoraccording
to
the
findings
of
physiognomists
those
analysts
of
facial
character
i
felt
involuntarily
reassured
in
his
presence
and
this
boded
well
for
our
interview
whether
this
individual
was
thirtyfive
or
fifty
years
of
age
i
could
not
precisely
state
he
was
tall
his
forehead
broad
his
nose
straight
his
mouth
clearly
etched
his
teeth
magnificent
his
hands
refined
tapered
and
to
use
a
word
from
palmistry
highly
psychic
in
other
words
worthy
of
serving
a
lofty
and
passionate
spirit
this
man
was
certainly
the
most
wonderful
physical
specimen
i
had
ever
encountered
one
unusual
detail
his
eyes
were
spaced
a
little
far
from
each
other
and
could
instantly
take
in
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
horizon
this
abilityas
i
later
verifiedwas
strengthened
by
a
range
of
vision
even
greater
than
ned
lands
when
this
stranger
focused
his
gaze
on
an
object
his
eyebrow
lines
gathered
into
a
frown
his
heavy
eyelids
closed
around
his
pupils
to
contract
his
huge
field
of
vision
and
he
looked
what
a
lookas
if
he
could
magnify
objects
shrinking
into
the
distance
as
if
he
could
probe
your
very
soul
as
if
he
could
pierce
those
sheets
of
water
so
opaque
to
our
eyes
and
scan
the
deepest
seas




wearing
caps
made
of
seaotter
fur
and
shod
in
sealskin
fishing
boots
these
two
strangers
were
dressed
in
clothing
made
from
some
unique
fabric
that
flattered
the
figure
and
allowed
great
freedom
of
movement
the
taller
of
the
twoapparently
the
leader
on
boardexamined
us
with
the
greatest
care
but
without
pronouncing
a
word
then
turning
to
his
companion
he
conversed
with
him
in
a
language
i
didnt
recognize
it
was
a
sonorous
harmonious
flexible
dialect
whose
vowels
seemed
to
undergo
a
highly
varied
accentuation
the
other
replied
with
a
shake
of
the
head
and
added
two
or
three
utterly
incomprehensible
words
then
he
seemed
to
question
me
directly
with
a
long
stare
i
replied
in
clear
french
that
i
wasnt
familiar
with
his
language
but
he
didnt
seem
to
understand
me
and
the
situation
grew
rather
baffling
still
master
should
tell
our
story
conseil
said
to
me
perhaps
these
gentlemen
will
grasp
a
few
words
of
it
i
tried
again
telling
the
tale
of
our
adventures
clearly
articulating
my
every
syllable
and
not
leaving
out
a
single
detail
i
stated
our
names
and
titles
then
in
order
i
introduced
professor
aronnax
his
manservant
conseil
and
mr
ned
land
harpooner
the
man
with
calm
gentle
eyes
listened
to
me
serenely
even
courteously
and
paid
remarkable
attention
but
nothing
in
his
facial
expression
indicated
that
he
understood
my
story
when
i
finished
he
didnt
pronounce
a
single
word
one
resource
still
left
was
to
speak
english
perhaps
they
would
be
familiar
with
this
nearly
universal
language
but
i
only
knew
it
as
i
did
the
german
language
well
enough
to
read
it
fluently
not
well
enough
to
speak
it
correctly
here
however
our
overriding
need
was
to
make
ourselves
understood
come
on
its
your
turn
i
told
the
harpooner
over
to
you
mr
land
pull
out
of
your
bag
of
tricks
the
best
english
ever
spoken
by
an
anglosaxon
and
try
for
a
more
favorable
result
than
mine
ned
needed
no
persuading
and
started
our
story
all
over
again
most
of
which
i
could
follow
its
content
was
the
same
but
the
form
differed
carried
away
by
his
volatile
temperament
the
canadian
put
great
animation
into
it
he
complained
vehemently
about
being
imprisoned
in
defiance
of
his
civil
rights
asked
by
virtue
of
which
law
he
was
hereby
detained
invoked
writs
of

corpus
threatened
to
press
charges
against
anyone
holding
him
in
illegal
custody
ranted
gesticulated
shouted
and
finally
conveyed
by
an
expressive
gesture
that
we
were
dying
of
hunger
this
was
perfectly
true
but
we
had
nearly
forgotten
the
fact
much
to
his
amazement
the
harpooner
seemed
no
more
intelligible
than
i
had
been
our
visitors
didnt
bat
an
eye
apparently
they
were
engineers
who
understood
the
languages
of
neither

french
physicist
arago
nor
the
english
physicist
faraday
thoroughly
baffled
after
vainly
exhausting
our
philological
resources
i
no
longer
knew
what
tactic
to
pursue
when
conseil
told
me
if

will
authorize
me
ill
tell
the
whole
business
in

what

like
most
flemish
people
with
all
due
respect
to
master
on
the
contrary
my
respect
is
due

go
to
it
my
boy
and
conseil
in
his
serene
voice
described
for
the
third
time
the
various
vicissitudes
of
our
story
but
despite
our
narrators
fine
accent
and
stylish
turns
of
phrase
the
german
language
met
with
no
success
finally
as
a
last
resort
i
hauled
out
everything
i
could
remember
from
my
early
schooldays
and
i
tried
to
narrate
our
adventures
in
latin
cicero
would
have
plugged
his
ears
and
sent
me
to
the
scullery
but
somehow
i
managed
to
pull
through
with
the
same
negative
result
this
last
attempt
ultimately
misfiring
the
two
strangers
exchanged
a
few
words
in
their
incomprehensible
language
and
withdrew
not
even
favoring
us
with
one
of
those
encouraging
gestures
that
are
used
in
every
country
in
the

the

this
is
outrageous

shouted
exploding
for
the
twentieth

i
ask
you
we
speak
french
english
german

latin
to
these
rogues
and
neither
of
them
has
the

even
answer

ned
i
told
the
seething
harpooner
anger
wont
get
us
anywhere
but
professor
our
irascible
companion
went
on
cant
you
see
that
we
could
die
of
hunger
in
this
iron
cage
bah
conseil
put
in
philosophically
we
can
hold
out
a
good
while
yet
my
friends
i
said
we
mustnt
despair
weve
gotten
out
of
tighter
spots
so
please
do
me
the
favor
of
waiting
a
bit
before
you
form
your
views
on
the
commander
and
crew
of
this

my
views
are
fully
formed
ned
land
shot
back
theyre
rogues
oh
good
and
from
what
country
roguedom
my
gallant
ned
as
yet
that
country
isnt
clearly
marked
on
maps
of
the
world
but
i
admit
that
the
nationality
of
these
two
strangers
is
hard
to
make
out
neither
english
french
nor
german
thats
all
we
can
say
but
im
tempted
to
think
that
the
commander
and
his
chief
officer
were
born
in
the
low
latitudes
there
must
be
southern
blood
in
them
but
as
to
whether
theyre
spaniards
turks
arabs
or
east
indians
their
physical
characteristics
dont
give
me
enough
to
go
on
and
as
for
their
speech
its
utterly
incomprehensible
thats
the
nuisance
in
not
knowing
every
language
conseil
replied

the
drawback
in
not
having
one
universal

which
would
all
go

ned
land
replied
dont
you
see
these
people
have
a
language
all
to
themselves
a
language
theyve
invented
just
to
cause
despair
in
decent
people
who
ask
for
a
little
dinner

when
you
open

the

we
sat
down

if
it
hadnt
been

this

would

we

in
liverpool

the

i
feel

to
mention
that

had
in

among
the

we
were
served
i
was
able
to
identify
various
daintily
dressed

but
i
couldnt
make
up
my
mind
about
certain
otherwise
excellent

i
couldnt
even
tell
whether
their
contents
belonged
to
the
vegetable

the
animal

for

a

long
as
the

translated

not

the

no
time

such

were

down

without
further
ado
i
did
the
same
by
now
i
felt
reassured
about
our
fate
and
it
seemed
obvious
that
our
hosts
didnt
intend
to
let
us
die
of
starvation
but
all
earthly
things
come
to
an
end
all

must
pass
even
the
hunger
of
people
who
havent
eaten
for
fifteen
hours
our
appetites
appeased
we
felt
an
urgent
need
for

natural
reaction
after

interminable
night

my
two
companions
lay
down
on
the
cabins
carpeting
and
were
soon
deep
in
slumber
as
for
me
i
gave
in
less
readily
to
this
intense
need
for
sleep
too
many
thoughts
had
piled
up
in
my
mind
too
many
insoluble
questions
had
arisen
too
many
images
were
keeping
my
eyelids
open
where
were

strange

was
carrying
us

toward

intense
nightmares
besieged
me
in
these
mysterious
marine
sanctuaries
i
envisioned
hosts
of
unknown
animals
and
this
underwater
boat
seemed
to
be
a
blood
relation
of
theirs
living
breathing
just
as
fearsome




then
my
mind
grew
calmer
my
imagination
melted
into
hazy
drowsiness
and
i
soon
fell
into
an
uneasy
slumber
chapter
9
the
tantrums
of
ned
land
i
have
no
idea
how
long
this
slumber
lasted
but
it
must
have
been
a
good
while
since
we
were
completely
over
our
exhaustion
i
was
the
first
one
to
wake
up
my
companions
werent
yet
stirring
and
still
lay
in
their
corners
like
inanimate
objects
i
had
barely
gotten
up
from
my
passably
hard
mattress
when
i
felt
my
mind
clear
my
brain
go
on
the
alert
so
i
began
a
careful
reexamination
of
our
cell
nothing
had
changed
in
its
interior
arrangements
the
prison
was
still
a
prison
and
its
prisoners
still
prisoners
but
taking
advantage
of
our
slumber
the
steward
had
cleared
the
table
consequently
nothing
indicated
any
forthcoming
improvement
in
our
situation
and
i
seriously
wondered
if
we
were
doomed
to
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
in
this
cage
this
prospect
seemed
increasingly
painful
to
me
because
even
though
my
brain
was
clear
of
its
obsessions
from
the
night
before
i
was
feeling
an
odd
shortwindedness
in
my
chest
it
was
becoming
hard
for
me
to
breathe
the
heavy
air
was
no
longer
sufficient
for
the
full
play
of
my
lungs
although
our
cell
was
large
we
obviously
had
used
up
most
of
the
oxygen
it
contained
in
essence
over
an
hours
time
a
single
human
being
consumes
all
the
oxygen
found
in
100
liters
of
air
at
which
point
that
air
has
become
charged
with
a
nearly
equal
amount
of
carbon
dioxide
and
is
no
longer
fit
for
breathing
so
it
was
now
urgent
to
renew
the
air
in
our
prison
and
no
doubt
the
air
in
this
whole
underwater
boat
as
well
here
a
question
popped
into
my
head
how
did
the
commander
of
this
aquatic
residence
go
about
it
did
he
obtain
air
using
chemical
methods
releasing
the
oxygen
contained
in
potassium
chlorate
by
heating
it
meanwhile
absorbing
the
carbon
dioxide
with
potassium
hydroxide
if
so
he
would
have
to
keep
up
some
kind
of
relationship
with
the
shore
to
come
by
the
materials
needed
for
such
an
operation
did
he
simply
limit
himself
to
storing
the
air
in
highpressure
tanks
and
then
dispense
it
according
to
his
crews
needs
perhaps
or
proceeding
in
a
more
convenient
more
economical
and
consequently
more
probable
fashion
was
he
satisfied
with
merely
returning
to
breathe
at
the
surface
of
the
water
like
a
cetacean
renewing
his
oxygen
supply
every
twentyfour
hours
in
any
event
whatever
his
method
was
it
seemed
prudent
to
me
that
he
use
this
method
without
delay
in
fact
i
had
already
resorted
to
speeding
up
my
inhalations
in
order
to
extract
from
the
cell
what
little
oxygen
it
contained
when
suddenly
i
was
refreshed
by
a
current
of
clean
air
scented
with
a
salty
aroma
it
had
to
be
a
sea
breeze
lifegiving
and
charged
with
iodine
i
opened
my
mouth
wide
and
my
lungs
glutted
themselves
on
the
fresh
particles
at
the
same
time
i
felt
a
swaying
a
rolling
of
moderate
magnitude
but
definitely
noticeable
this
boat
this
sheetiron
monster
had
obviously
just
risen
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
there
to
breathe
in
good
whale
fashion
so
the
ships
mode
of
ventilation
was
finally
established
when
i
had
absorbed
a
chestful
of
this
clean
air
i
looked
for
the
conduitthe
air
carrier
if
you
preferthat
allowed
this
beneficial
influx
to
reach
us
and
i
soon
found
it
above
the
door
opened
an
air
vent
that
let
in
a
fresh
current
of
oxygen
renewing
the
thin
air
in
our
cell
i
had
gotten
to
this
point
in
my
observations
when
ned
and
conseil
woke
up
almost
simultaneously
under
the
influence
of
this
reviving
air
purification
they
rubbed
their
eyes
stretched
their
arms
and
sprang
to
their
feet
did
master
sleep
well
conseil
asked
me
with
his
perennial
good
manners
extremely
well
my
gallant
lad
i
replied
and
how
about
you
mr
ned
land
like
a
log
professor
but
i
must
be
imagining
things
because
it
seems
like
im
breathing
a
sea
breeze
a
seaman
couldnt
be
wrong
on
this
topic
and
i
told
the
canadian
what
had
gone
on
while
he
slept
good
he
said
that
explains
perfectly
all
that
bellowing
we
heard
when
our
socalled
narwhale
lay
in
sight
of
the
abraham
lincoln
perfectly
mr
land
it
was
catching
its
breath
only
ive
no
idea
what
time
it
is
professor
aronnax
unless
maybe
its
dinnertime
dinnertime
my
fine
harpooner
id
say
at
least
breakfast
time
because
weve
certainly
woken
up
to
a
new
day
which
indicates
conseil
replied
that
weve
spent
twentyfour
hours
in
slumber
thats
my
assessment
i
replied
i
wont
argue
with
you
ned
land
answered
but
dinner
or
breakfast
that
steward
will
be
plenty
welcome
whether
he
brings
the
one
or
the
other
the
one
and
the
other
conseil
said
well
put
the
canadian
replied
we
deserve
two
meals
and
speaking
for
myself
ill
do
justice
to
them
both
all
right
ned
lets
wait
and
see
i
replied
its
clear
that
these
strangers
dont
intend
to
let
us
die
of
hunger
otherwise
last
evenings
dinner
wouldnt
make
any
sense
unless
theyre
fattening
us
up
ned
shot
back
i
object
i
replied
we
have
not
fallen
into
the
hands
of
cannibals
just
because
they
dont
make
a
habit
of
it
the
canadian
replied
in
all
seriousness
doesnt
mean
they
dont
indulge
from
time
to
time
who
knows
maybe
these
people
have
gone
without
fresh
meat
for
a
long
while
and
in
that
case
three
healthy
wellbuilt
specimens
like
the
professor
his
manservant
and
me
get
rid
of
those
ideas
mr
land
i
answered
the
harpooner
and
above
all
dont
let
them
lead
you
to
flare
up
against
our
hosts
which
would
only
make
our
situation
worse
anyhow
the
harpooner
said
im
as
hungry
as
all
hades
and
dinner
or
breakfast
not
one
puny
meal
has
arrived
mr
land
i
answered
we
have
to
adapt
to
the
schedule
on
board
and
i
imagine
our
stomachs
are
running
ahead
of
the
chief
cooks
dinner
bell
well
then
well
adjust
our
stomachs
to
the
chefs
timetable
conseil
replied
serenely
there
you
go
again
conseil
my
friend
the
impatient
canadian
shot
back
you
never
allow
yourself
any
displays
of
bile
or
attacks
of
nerves
youre
everlastingly
calm
youd
say
your
aftermeal
grace
even
if
you
didnt
get
any
food
for
your
beforemeal
blessingand
youd
starve
to
death
rather
than
complain
what
good
would
it
do
conseil
asked
complaining
doesnt
have
to
do
good
it
just
feels
good
and
if
these
piratesi
say
pirates
out
of
consideration
for
the
professors
feelings
since
he
doesnt
want
us
to
call
them
cannibalsif
these
pirates
think
theyre
going
to
smother
me
in
this
cage
without
hearing
what
cusswords
spice
up
my
outbursts
theyve
got
another
think
coming
look
here
professor
aronnax
speak
frankly
how
long
do
you
figure
theyll
keep
us
in
this
iron
box
to
tell
the
truth
friend
land
i
know
little
more
about
it
than
you
do
but
in
a
nutshell
what
do
you
suppose
is
going
on
my
supposition
is
that
sheer
chance
has
made
us
privy
to
an
important
secret
now
then
if
the
crew
of
this
underwater
boat
have
a
personal
interest
in
keeping
that
secret
and
if
their
personal
interest
is
more
important
than
the
lives
of
three
men
i
believe
that
our
very
existence
is
in
jeopardy
if
such
is
not
the
case
then
at
the
first
available
opportunity
this
monster
that
has
swallowed
us
will
return
us
to
the
world
inhabited
by
our
own
kind
unless
they
recruit
us
to
serve
on
the
crew
conseil
said
and
keep
us
here
till
the
moment
ned
land
answered
when
some
frigate
thats
faster
or
smarter
than
the
abraham
lincoln
captures
this
den
of
buccaneers
then
hangs
all
of
us
by
the
neck
from
the
tip
of
a
mainmast
yardarm
well
thought
out
mr
land
i
replied
but
as
yet
i
dont
believe
weve
been
tendered
any
enlistment
offers
consequently
its
pointless
to
argue
about
what
tactics
we
should
pursue
in
such
a
case
i
repeat
lets
wait
lets
be
guided
by
events
and
lets
do
nothing
since
right
now
theres
nothing
we
can
do
on
the
contrary
professor
the
harpooner
replied
not
wanting
to
give
in
there
is
something
we
can
do
oh
and
what
mr
land
break
out
of
here
breaking
out
of
a
prison
on
shore
is
difficult
enough
but
with
an
underwater
prison
it
strikes
me
as
completely
unworkable
come
now
ned
my
friend
conseil
asked
how
would
you
answer
masters
objection
i
refuse
to
believe
that
an
american
is
at
the
end
of
his
tether
visibly
baffled
the
harpooner
said
nothing
under
the
conditions
in
which
fate
had
left
us
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
escape
but
a
canadians
wit
is
half
french
and
mr
ned
land
made
this
clear
in
his
reply
so
professor
aronnax
he
went
on
after
thinking
for
a
few
moments
you
havent
figured
out
what
people
do
when
they
cant
escape
from
their
prison
no
my
friend
easy
they
fix
things
so
they
stay
there
of
course
conseil
put
in
since
were
deep
in
the
ocean
being
inside
this
boat
is
vastly
preferable
to
being
above
it
or
below
it
but
we
fix
things
by
kicking
out
all
the
jailers
guards
and
wardens
ned
land
added
whats
this
ned
i
asked
youd
seriously
consider
taking
over
this
craft
very
seriously
the
canadian
replied
its
impossible
and
why
is
that
sir
some
promising
opportunity
might
come
up
and
i
dont
see
what
could
stop
us
from
taking
advantage
of
it
if
there
are
only
about
twenty
men
on
board
this
machine
i
dont
think
they
can
stave
off
two
frenchmen
and
a
canadian
it
seemed
wiser
to
accept
the
harpooners
proposition
than
to
debate
it
accordingly
i
was
content
to
reply
let
such
circumstances
come
mr
land
and
well
see
but
until
then
i
beg
you
to
control
your
impatience
we
need
to
act
shrewdly
and
your
flareups
wont
give
rise
to
any
promising
opportunities
so
swear
to
me
that
youll
accept
our
situation
without
throwing
a
tantrum
over
it
i
give
you
my
word
professor
ned
land
replied
in
an
unenthusiastic
tone
no
vehement
phrases
will
leave
my
mouth
no
vicious
gestures
will
give
my
feelings
away
not
even
when
they
dont
feed
us
on
time
i
have
your
word
ned
i
answered
the
canadian
then
our
conversation
petered
out
and
each
of
us
withdrew
into
his
own
thoughts
for
my
part
despite
the
harpooners
confident
talk
i
admit
that
i
entertained
no
illusions
i
had
no
faith
in
those
promising
opportunities
that
ned
land
mentioned
to
operate
with
such
efficiency
this
underwater
boat
had
to
have
a
sizeable
crew
so
if
it
came
to
a
physical
contest
we
would
be
facing
an
overwhelming
opponent
besides
before
we
could
do
anything
we
had
to
be
free
and
that
we
definitely
were
not
i
didnt
see
any
way
out
of
this
sheetiron
hermetically
sealed
cell
and
if
the
strange
commander
of
this
boat
did
have
a
secret
to
keepwhich
seemed
rather
likelyhe
would
never
give
us
freedom
of
movement
aboard
his
vessel
now
then
would
he
resort
to
violence
in
order
to
be
rid
of
us
or
would
he
drop
us
off
one
day
on
some
remote
coast
there
lay
the
unknown
all
these
hypotheses
seemed
extremely
plausible
to
me
and
to
hope
for
freedom
through
use
of
force
you
had
to
be
a
harpooner
i
realized
moreover
that
ned
lands
brooding
was
getting
him
madder
by
the
minute
little
by
little
i
heard
those
aforesaid
cusswords
welling
up
in
the
depths
of
his
gullet
and
i
saw
his
movements
turn
threatening
again
he
stood
up
pacing
in
circles
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
cage
striking
the
walls
with
his
foot
and
fist
meanwhile
the
hours
passed
our
hunger
nagged
unmercifully
and
this
time
the
steward
did
not
appear
which
amounted
to
forgetting
our
castaway
status
for
much
too
long
if
they
really
had
good
intentions
toward
us
tortured
by
the
growling
of
his
wellbuilt
stomach
ned
land
was
getting
more
and
more
riled
and
despite
his
word
of
honor
i
was
in
real
dread
of
an
explosion
when
he
stood
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
men
on
board
for
two
more
hours
ned
lands
rage
increased
the
canadian
shouted
and
pleaded
but
to
no
avail
the
sheetiron
walls
were
deaf
i
didnt
hear
a
single
sound
inside
this
deadseeming
boat
the
vessel
hadnt
stirred
because
i
obviously
would
have
felt
its
hull
vibrating
under
the
influence
of
the
propeller
it
had
undoubtedly
sunk
into
the
watery
deep
and
no
longer
belonged
to
the
outside
world
all
this
dismal
silence
was
terrifying
as
for
our
neglect
our
isolation
in
the
depths
of
this
cell
i
was
afraid
to
guess
at
how
long
it
might
last
little
by
little
hopes
i
had
entertained
after
our
interview
with
the
ships
commander
were
fading
away
the
gentleness
of
the
mans
gaze
the
generosity
expressed
in
his
facial
features
the
nobility
of
his
bearing
all
vanished
from
my
memory
i
saw
this
mystifying
individual
anew
for
what
he
inevitably
must
be
cruel
and
merciless
i
viewed
him
as
outside
humanity
beyond
all
feelings
of
compassion
the
implacable
foe
of
his
fellow
man
toward
whom
he
must
have
sworn
an
undying
hate
but
even
so
was
the
man
going
to
let
us
die
of
starvation
locked
up
in
this
cramped
prison
exposed
to
those
horrible
temptations
to
which
people
are
driven
by
extreme
hunger
this
grim
possibility
took
on
a
dreadful
intensity
in
my
mind
and
fired
by
my
imagination
i
felt
an
unreasoning
terror
run
through
me
conseil
stayed
calm
ned
land
bellowed
just
then
a
noise
was
audible
outside
footsteps
rang
on
the
metal
tiling
the
locks
were
turned
the
door
opened
the
steward
appeared
before
i
could
make
a
single
movement
to
prevent
him
the
canadian
rushed
at
the
poor
man
threw
him
down
held
him
by
the
throat
the
steward
was
choking
in
the
grip
of
those
powerful
hands
conseil
was
already
trying
to
loosen
the
harpooners
hands
from
his
halfsuffocated
victim
and
i
had
gone
to
join
in
the
rescue
when
i
was
abruptly
nailed
to
the
spot
by
these
words
pronounced
in
french
calm
down
mr
land
and
you
professor
kindly
listen
to
me
chapter
10
the
man
of
the
waters
it
was
the
ships
commander
who
had
just
spoken
at
these
words
ned
land
stood
up
quickly
nearly
strangled
the
steward
staggered
out
at
a
signal
from
his
superior
but
such
was
the
commanders
authority
aboard
his
vessel
not
one
gesture
gave
away
the
resentment
that
this
man
must
have
felt
toward
the
canadian
in
silence
we
waited
for
the
outcome
of
this
scene
conseil
in
spite
of
himself
seemed
almost
fascinated
i
was
stunned
arms
crossed
leaning
against
a
corner
of
the
table
the
commander
studied
us
with
great
care
was
he
reluctant
to
speak
further
did
he
regret
those
words
he
had
just
pronounced
in
french
you
would
have
thought
so
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
which
none
of
us
would
have
dreamed
of
interrupting
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
calm
penetrating
voice
i
speak
french
english
german
and
latin
with
equal
fluency
hence
i
could
have
answered
you
as
early
as
our
initial
interview
but
first
i
wanted
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
then
think
things
over
your
four
versions
of
the
same
narrative
perfectly
consistent
by
and
large
established
your
personal
identities
for
me
i
now
know
that
sheer
chance
has
placed
in
my
presence
professor
pierre
aronnax
specialist
in
natural
history
at
the
paris
museum
and
entrusted
with
a
scientific
mission
abroad
his
manservant
conseil
and
ned
land
a
harpooner
of
canadian
origin
aboard
the
abraham
lincoln
a
frigate
in
the
national
navy
of
the
united
states
of
america
i
bowed
in
agreement
the
commander
hadnt
put
a
question
to
me
so
no
answer
was
called
for
this
man
expressed
himself
with
perfect
ease
and
without
a
trace
of
an
accent
his
phrasing
was
clear
his
words
well
chosen
his
facility
in
elocution
remarkable
and
yet
to
me
he
didnt
have
the
feel
of
a
fellow
countryman
he
went
on
with
the
conversation
as
follows
no
doubt
sir
youve
felt
that
i
waited
rather
too
long
before
paying
you
this
second
visit
after
discovering
your
identities
i
wanted
to
weigh
carefully
what
policy
to
pursue
toward
you
i
had
great
difficulty
deciding
some
extremely
inconvenient
circumstances
have
brought
you
into
the
presence
of
a
man
who
has
cut
himself
off
from
humanity
your
coming
has
disrupted
my
whole
existence
unintentionally
i
said
unintentionally
the
stranger
replied
raising
his
voice
a
little
was
it
unintentionally
that
the
abraham
lincoln
hunted
me
on
every
sea
was
it
unintentionally
that
you
traveled
aboard
that
frigate
was
it
unintentionally
that
your
shells
bounced
off
my
ships
hull
was
it
unintentionally
that
mr
ned
land
hit
me
with
his
harpoon
i
detected
a
controlled
irritation
in
these
words
but
there
was
a
perfectly
natural
reply
to
these
charges
and
i
made
it
sir
i
said
youre
surely
unaware
of
the
discussions
that
have
taken
place
in
europe
and
america
with
yourself
as
the
subject
you
dont
realize
that
various
accidents
caused
by
collisions
with
your
underwater
machine
have
aroused
public
passions
on
those
two
continents
ill
spare
you
the
innumerable
hypotheses
with
which
weve
tried
to
explain
this
inexplicable
phenomenon
whose
secret
is
yours
alone
but
please
understand
that
the
abraham
lincoln
chased
you
over
the
pacific
high
seas
in
the
belief
it
was
hunting
some
powerful
marine
monster
which
had
to
be
purged
from
the
ocean
at
all
cost
a
half
smile
curled
the
commanders
lips
then
in
a
calmer
tone
professor
aronnax
he
replied
do
you
dare
claim
that
your
frigate
wouldnt
have
chased
and
cannonaded
an
underwater
boat
as
readily
as
a
monster
this
question
baffled
me
since
commander
farragut
would
certainly
have
shown
no
such
hesitation
he
would
have
seen
it
as
his
sworn
duty
to
destroy
a
contrivance
of
this
kind
just
as
promptly
as
a
gigantic
narwhale
so
you
understand
sir
the
stranger
went
on
that
i
have
a
right
to
treat
you
as
my
enemy
i
kept
quiet
with
good
reason
what
was
the
use
of
debating
such
a
proposition
when
superior
force
can
wipe
out
the
best
arguments
it
took
me
a
good
while
to
decide
the
commander
went
on
nothing
obliged
me
to
grant
you
hospitality
if
i
were
to
part
company
with
you
id
have
no
personal
interest
in
ever
seeing
you
again
i
could
put
you
back
on
the
platform
of
this
ship
that
has
served
as
your
refuge
i
could
sink
under
the
sea
and
i
could
forget
you
ever
existed
wouldnt
that
be
my
right
perhaps
it
would
be
the
right
of
a
savage
i
replied
but
not
that
of
a
civilized
man
professor
the
commander
replied
swiftly
im
not
what
you
term
a
civilized
man
ive
severed
all
ties
with
society
for
reasons
that
i
alone
have
the
right
to
appreciate
therefore
i
obey
none
of
its
regulations
and
i
insist
that
you
never
invoke
them
in
front
of
me
this
was
plain
speaking
a
flash
of
anger
and
scorn
lit
up
the
strangers
eyes
and
i
glimpsed
a
fearsome
past
in
this
mans
life
not
only
had
he
placed
himself
beyond
human
laws
he
had
rendered
himself
independent
out
of
all
reach
free
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
for
who
would
dare
chase
him
to
the
depths
of
the
sea
when
he
thwarted
all
attacks
on
the
surface
what
ship
could
withstand
a
collision
with
his
underwater
monitor
what
armor
plate
no
matter
how
heavy
could
bear
the
thrusts
of
his
spur
no
man
among
men
could
call
him
to
account
for
his
actions
god
if
he
believed
in
him
his
conscience
if
he
had
onethese
were
the
only
judges
to
whom
he
was
answerable
these
thoughts
swiftly
crossed
my
mind
while
this
strange
individual
fell
silent
like
someone
completely
selfabsorbed
i
regarded
him
with
a
mixture
of
fear
and
fascination
in
the
same
way
no
doubt
that
oedipus
regarded
the
sphinx
after
a
fairly
long
silence
the
commander
went
on
with
our
conversation
so
i
had
difficulty
deciding
he
said
but
i
concluded
that
my
personal
interests
could
be
reconciled
with
that
natural
compassion
to
which
every
human
being
has
a
right
since
fate
has
brought
you
here
youll
stay
aboard
my
vessel
youll
be
free
here
and
in
exchange
for
that
freedom
moreover
totally
related
to
it
ill
lay
on
you
just
one
condition
your
word
that
youll
submit
to
it
will
be
sufficient
go
on
sir
i
replied
i
assume
this
condition
is
one
an
honest
man
can
accept
yes
sir
just
this
its
possible
that
certain
unforeseen
events
may
force
me
to
confine
you
to
your
cabins
for
some
hours
or
even
for
some
days
as
the
case
may
be
since
i
prefer
never
to
use
violence
i
expect
from
you
in
such
a
case
even
more
than
in
any
other
your
unquestioning
obedience
by
acting
in
this
way
i
shield
you
from
complicity
i
absolve
you
of
all
responsibility
since
i
myself
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
see
what
you
arent
meant
to
see
do
you
accept
this
condition
so
things
happened
on
board
that
were
quite
odd
to
say
the
least
things
never
to
be
seen
by
people
not
placing
themselves
beyond
societys
laws
among
all
the
surprises
the
future
had
in
store
for
me
this
would
not
be
the
mildest
we
accept
i
replied
only
ill
ask
your
permission
sir
to
address
a
question
to
you
just
one
go
ahead
sir
you
said
wed
be
free
aboard
your
vessel
completely
then
i
would
ask
what
you
mean
by
this
freedom
why
the
freedom
to
come
go
see
and
even
closely
observe
everything
happening
hereexcept
under
certain
rare
circumstancesin
short
the
freedom
we
ourselves
enjoy
my
companions
and
i
it
was
obvious
that
we
did
not
understand
each
other
pardon
me
sir
i
went
on
but
thats
merely
the
freedom
that
every
prisoner
has
the
freedom
to
pace
his
cell
thats
not
enough
for
us
nevertheless
it
will
have
to
do
what
we
must
give
up
seeing
our
homeland
friends
and
relatives
ever
again
yes
sir
but
giving
up
that
intolerable
earthly
yoke
that
some
men
call
freedom
is
perhaps
less
painful
than
you
think
by
thunder
ned
land
shouted
ill
never
promise
i
wont
try
getting
out
of
here
i
didnt
ask
for
such
a
promise
mr
land
the
commander
replied
coldly
sir
i
replied
flaring
up
in
spite
of
myself
youre
taking
unfair
advantage
of
us
this
is
sheer
cruelty
no
sir
its
an
act
of
mercy
youre
my
prisoners
of
war
ive
cared
for
you
when
with
a
single
word
i
could
plunge
you
back
into
the
ocean
depths
you
attacked
me
youve
just
stumbled
on
a
secret
no
living
man
must
probe
the
secret
of
my
entire
existence
do
you
think
ill
send
you
back
to
a
world
that
must
know
nothing
more
of
me
never
by
keeping
you
on
board
it
isnt
you
whom
i
care
for
its
me
these
words
indicated
that
the
commander
pursued
a
policy
impervious
to
arguments
then
sir
i
went
on
you
give
us
quite
simply
a
choice
between
life
and
death
quite
simply
my
friends
i
said
to
a
question
couched
in
these
terms
our
answer
can
be
taken
for
granted
but
no
solemn
promises
bind
us
to
the
commander
of
this
vessel
none
sir
the
stranger
replied
then
in
a
gentler
voice
he
went
on
now
allow
me
to
finish
what
i
have
to
tell
you
ive
heard
of
you
professor
aronnax
you
if
not
your
companions
wont
perhaps
complain
too
much
about
the
stroke
of
fate
that
has
brought
us
together
among
the
books
that
make
up
my
favorite
reading
youll
find
the
work
youve
published
on
the
great
ocean
depths
ive
pored
over
it
youve
taken
your
studies
as
far
as
terrestrial
science
can
go
but
you
dont
know
everything
because
you
havent
seen
everything
let
me
tell
you
professor
you
wont
regret
the
time
you
spend
aboard
my
vessel
youre
going
to
voyage
through
a
land
of
wonders
stunned
amazement
will
probably
be
your
habitual
state
of
mind
it
will
be
a
long
while
before
you
tire
of
the
sights
constantly
before
your
eyes
im
going
to
make
another
underwater
tour
of
the
worldperhaps
my
last
who
knowsand
ill
review
everything
ive
studied
in
the
depths
of
these
seas
that
ive
crossed
so
often
and
you
can
be
my
fellow
student
starting
this
very
day
youll
enter
a
new
element
youll
see
what
no
human
being
has
ever
seen
beforesince
my
men
and
i
no
longer
countand
thanks
to
me
youre
going
to
learn
the
ultimate
secrets
of
our
planet
i
cant
deny
it
the
commanders
words
had
a
tremendous
effect
on
me
he
had
caught
me
on
my
weak
side
and
i
momentarily
forgot
that
not
even
this
sublime
experience
was
worth
the
loss
of
my
freedom
besides
i
counted
on
the
future
to
resolve
this
important
question
so
i
was
content
to
reply
sir
even
though
youve
cut
yourself
off
from
humanity
i
can
see
that
you
havent
disowned
all
human
feeling
were
castaways
whom
youve
charitably
taken
aboard
well
never
forget
that
speaking
for
myself
i
dont
rule
out
that
the
interests
of
science
could
override
even
the
need
for
freedom
which
promises
me
that
in
exchange
our
encounter
will
provide
great
rewards
i
thought
the
commander
would
offer
me
his
hand
to
seal
our
agreement
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
i
regretted
that
one
last
question
i
said
just
as
this
inexplicable
being
seemed
ready
to
withdraw
ask
it
professor
by
what
name
am
i
to
call
you
sir
the
commander
replied
to
you
im
simply
captain
nemo
to
me
you
and
your
companions
are
simply
passengers
on
the
nautilus
latin
nemo
means
no
one
ed
captain
nemo
called
out
a
steward
appeared
the
captain
gave
him
his
orders
in
that
strange
language
i
couldnt
even
identify
then
turning
to
the
canadian
and
conseil
a
meal
is
waiting
for
you
in
your
cabin
he
told
them
kindly
follow
this
man
thats
an
offer
i
cant
refuse
the
harpooner
replied
after
being
confined
for
over
thirty
hours
he
and
conseil
were
finally
out
of
this
cell
and
now
professor
aronnax
our
own
breakfast
is
ready
allow
me
to
lead
the
way
yours
to
command
captain
i
followed
captain
nemo
and
as
soon
as
i
passed
through
the
doorway
i
went
down
a
kind
of
electrically
lit
passageway
that
resembled
a
gangway
on
a
ship
after
a
stretch
of
some
ten
meters
a
second
door
opened
before
me
i
then
entered
a
dining
room
decorated
and
furnished
in
austere
good
taste
inlaid
with
ebony
trim
tall
oaken
sideboards
stood
at
both
ends
of
this
room
and
sparkling
on
their
shelves
were
staggered
rows
of
earthenware
porcelain
and
glass
of
incalculable
value
there
silverplated
dinnerware
gleamed
under
rays
pouring
from
light
fixtures
in
the
ceiling
whose
glare
was
softened
and
tempered
by
delicately
painted
designs
in
the
center
of
this
room
stood
a
table
richly
spread
captain
nemo
indicated
the
place
i
was
to
occupy
be
seated
he
told
me
and
eat
like
the
famished
man
you
must
be
our
breakfast
consisted
of
several
dishes
whose
contents
were
all
supplied
by
the
sea
and
some
foods
whose
nature
and
derivation
were
unknown
to
me
they
were
good
i
admit
but
with
a
peculiar
flavor
to
which
i
would
soon
grow
accustomed
these
various
food
items
seemed
to
be
rich
in
phosphorous
and
i
thought
that
they
too
must
have
been
of
marine
origin
captain
nemo
stared
at
me
i
had
asked
him
nothing
but
he
read
my
thoughts
and
on
his
own
he
answered
the
questions
i
was
itching
to
address
him
most
of
these
dishes
are
new
to
you
he
told
me
but
you
can
consume
them
without
fear
theyre
healthy
and
nourishing
i
renounced
terrestrial
foods
long
ago
and
im
none
the
worse
for
it
my
crew
are
strong
and
full
of
energy
and
they
eat
what
i
eat
so
i
said
all
these
foods
are
products
of
the
sea
yes
professor
the
sea
supplies
all
my
needs
sometimes
i
cast
my
nets
in
our
wake
and
i
pull
them
up
ready
to
burst
sometimes
i
go
hunting
right
in
the
midst
of
this
element
that
has
long
seemed
so
far
out
of
mans
reach
and
i
corner
the
game
that
dwells
in
my
underwater
forests
like
the
flocks
of
old
proteus
king
neptunes
shepherd
my
herds
graze
without
fear
on
the
oceans
immense
prairies
there
i
own
vast
properties
that
i
harvest
myself
and
which
are
forever
sown
by
the
hand
of
the
creator
of
all
things
i
stared
at
captain
nemo
in
definite
astonishment
and
i
answered
him
sir
i
understand
perfectly
how
your
nets
can
furnish
excellent
fish
for
your
table
i
understand
less
how
you
can
chase
aquatic
game
in
your
underwater
forests
but
how
a
piece
of
red
meat
no
matter
how
small
can
figure
in
your
menu
that
i
dont
understand
at
all
nor
i
sir
captain
nemo
answered
me
i
never
touch
the
flesh
of
land
animals
nevertheless
this




i
went
on
pointing
to
a
dish
where
some
slices
of
loin
were
still
left
what
you
believe
to
be
red
meat
professor
is
nothing
other
than
loin
of
sea
turtle
similarly
here
are
some
dolphin
livers
you
might
mistake
for
stewed
pork
my
chef
is
a
skillful
food
processor
who
excels
at
pickling
and
preserving
these
various
exhibits
from
the
ocean
feel
free
to
sample
all
of
these
foods
here
are
some
preserves
of
sea
cucumber
that
a
malaysian
would
declare
to
be
unrivaled
in
the

you
some

so
i
sampled
away
more
as
a
curiosity
seeker
than
an
epicure
while
captain
nemo
delighted
me
with
his
incredible
anecdotes
but
this
sea
professor
aronnax
he
told
me
this
prodigious
inexhaustible
wet
nurse
of
a
sea
not
only
feeds
me
she
dresses
me
as
well
that
fabric
covering
you
was
woven
from
the
masses
of
filaments
that
anchor
certain
seashells
as
the
ancients
were
wont
to
do
it
was
dyed
with
purple

with

hare
the
perfumes
youll
find
on
the
washstand
in
your

from
the

of
marine

your

was
made
from

your

everything

someday
everything
will
return

you
love
the

captain
yes
i
love
it
the
sea
is
the
be

and
end
all
it
covers
seventenths
of
the
planet
earth
its
breath
is
clean
and
healthy
its
an
immense
wilderness
where
a
man
is
never
lonely
because
he
feels
life
astir
on
every
side
the
sea
is
simply
the
vehicle
for
a
prodigious
unearthly
mode
of
existence
its
simply
movement
and
love
its
living
infinity
as
one
of
your
poets
put
it
and
in
essence
professor
nature
is
here
made
manifest
by
all
three
of
her
kingdoms
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
the
last
of
these
is
amply
represented

totaling
more

13000
species

the

a
vast

our

with
the

so
to
speak
and
who
can
say
we
wont
end
with
it
here
lies
supreme
tranquility
the

doesnt
belong

still
exercise
their

thirty

their

ah

captain
nemo
suddenly
fell
silent
in
the
midst
of
this
enthusiastic
outpouring
had
he
let
himself
get
carried
away
past
the
bounds
of
his
habitual
reserve
had
he
said
too
much
for
a
few
moments
he
strolled
up
and
down
all
aquiver
then
his
nerves
grew
calmer
his
facial
features
recovered
their
usual
icy
composure
and
turning
to
me
now
professor
he
said
if
youd
like
to
inspect
the

im

the
nautilus
captain
nemo
stood
up
i
followed
him
contrived
at
the
rear
of
the
dining
room
a
double
door
opened
and
i
entered
a
room
whose
dimensions
equaled
the
one
i
had
just
left
it
was
a
library
tall
blackrosewood
bookcases
inlaid
with
copperwork
held
on
their
wide
shelves
a
large
number
of
uniformly
bound
books
these
furnishings
followed
the
contours
of
the
room
their
lower
parts
leading
to
huge
couches
upholstered
in
maroon
leather
and
curved
for
maximum
comfort
light
movable
reading
stands
which
could
be
pushed
away
or
pulled
near
as
desired
allowed
books
to
be
positioned
on
them
for
easy
study
in
the
center
stood
a
huge
table
covered
with
pamphlets
among
which
some
newspapers
long
out
of
date
were
visible
electric
light
flooded
this
whole
harmonious
totality
falling
from
four
frosted
half
globes
set
in
the
scrollwork
of
the
ceiling
i
stared
in
genuine
wonderment
at
this
room
so
ingeniously
laid
out
and
i
couldnt
believe
my
eyes
captain
nemo
i
told
my
host
who
had
just
stretched
out
on
a
couch
this
is
a
library
that
would
do
credit
to
more
than
one
continental
palace
and
i
truly
marvel
to
think
it
can
go
with
you
into
the
deepest
seas
where
could
one
find
greater
silence
or
solitude
professor
captain
nemo
replied
did
your
study
at
the
museum
afford
you
such
a
perfect
retreat
no
sir
and
i
might
add
that
its
quite
a
humble
one
next
to
yours
you
own
6000
or
7000
volumes
here



12000
professor
aronnax
theyre
my
sole
remaining
ties
with
dry
land
but
i
was
done
with
the
shore
the
day
my
nautilus
submerged
for
the
first
time
under
the
waters
that
day
i
purchased
my
last
volumes
my
last
pamphlets
my
last
newspapers
and
ever
since
ive
chosen
to
believe
that
humanity
no
longer
thinks
or
writes
in
any
event
professor
these
books
are
at
your
disposal
and
you
may
use
them
freely
i
thanked
captain
nemo
and
approached
the
shelves
of
this
library
written
in
every
language
books
on
science
ethics
and
literature
were
there
in
abundance
but
i
didnt
see
a
single
work
on
economicsthey
seemed
to
be
strictly
banned
on
board
one
odd
detail
all
these
books
were
shelved
indiscriminately
without
regard
to
the
language
in
which
they
were
written
and
this
jumble
proved
that
the
nautiluss
captain
could
read
fluently
whatever
volumes
he
chanced
to
pick
up
among
these
books
i
noted
masterpieces
by
the
greats
of
ancient
and
modern
times
in
other
words
all
of
humanitys
finest
achievements
in
history
poetry
fiction
and
science
from
homer
to
victor
hugo
from
xenophon
to
michelet
from
rabelais
to
madame
george
sand
but
science
in
particular
represented
the
major
investment
of
this
library
books
on
mechanics
ballistics
hydrography
meteorology
geography
geology
etc
held
a
place
there
no
less
important
than
works
on
natural
history
and
i
realized
that
they
made
up
the
captains
chief
reading
there
i
saw
the
complete
works
of
humboldt
the
complete
arago
as
well
as
works
by
foucault
henri
sainteclaire
deville
chasles
milneedwards
quatrefages
john
tyndall
faraday
berthelot
father
secchi
petermann
commander
maury
louis
agassiz
etc
plus
the
transactions
of
frances
academy
of
sciences
bulletins
from
the
various
geographical
societies
etc
and
in
a
prime
location
those
two
volumes
on
the
great
ocean
depths
that
had
perhaps
earned
me
this
comparatively
charitable
welcome
from
captain
nemo
among
the
works
of
joseph
bertrand
his
book
entitled
the
founders
of
astronomy
even
gave
me
a
definite
date
and
since
i
knew
it
had
appeared
in
the
course
of
1865
i
concluded
that
the
fitting
out
of
the
nautilus
hadnt
taken
place
before
then
accordingly
three
years
ago
at
the
most
captain
nemo
had
begun
his
underwater
existence
moreover
i
hoped
some
books
even
more
recent
would
permit
me
to
pinpoint
the
date
precisely
but
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
look
for
them
and
i
didnt
want
to
put
off
any
longer
our
stroll
through
the
wonders
of
the
nautilus
sir
i
told
the
captain
thank
you
for
placing
this
library
at
my
disposal
there
are
scientific
treasures
here
and
ill
take
advantage
of
them
this
room
isnt
only
a
library
captain
nemo
said
its
also
a
smoking
room
a
smoking
room
i
exclaimed
then
one
may
smoke
on
board
surely
in
that
case
sir
im
forced
to
believe
that
youve
kept
up
relations
with
havana
none
whatever
the
captain
replied
try
this
cigar
professor
aronnax
and
even
though
it
doesnt
come
from
havana
it
will
satisfy
you
if
youre
a
connoisseur
i
took
the
cigar
offered
me
whose
shape
recalled
those
from
cuba
but
it
seemed
to
be
made
of
gold
leaf
i
lit
it
at
a
small
brazier
supported
by
an
elegant
bronze
stand
and
i
inhaled
my
first
whiffs
with
the
relish
of
a
smoker
who
hasnt
had
a
puff
in
days
its
excellent
i
said
but
its
not
from
the
tobacco
plant
right
the
captain
replied
this
tobacco
comes
from
neither
havana
nor
the
orient
its
a
kind
of
nicotinerich
seaweed
that
the
ocean
supplies
me
albeit
sparingly
do
you
still
miss
your
cubans
sir
captain
i
scorn
them
from
this
day
forward
then
smoke
these
cigars
whenever
you
like
without
debating
their
origin
they
bear
no
government
seal
of
approval
but
i
imagine
theyre
none
the
worse
for
it
on
the
contrary
just
then
captain
nemo
opened
a
door
facing
the
one
by
which
i
had
entered
the
library
and
i
passed
into
an
immense
splendidly
lit
lounge
it
was
a
huge
quadrilateral
with
canted
corners
ten
meters
long
six
wide
five
high
a
luminous
ceiling
decorated
with
delicate
arabesques
distributed
a
soft
clear
daylight
over
all
the
wonders
gathered
in
this
museum
for
a
museum
it
truly
was
in
which
clever
hands
had
spared
no
expense
to
amass
every
natural
and
artistic
treasure
displaying
them
with
the
helterskelter
picturesqueness
that
distinguishes
a
painters
studio
some
thirty
pictures
by
the
masters
uniformly
framed
and
separated
by
gleaming
panoplies
of
arms
adorned
walls
on
which
were
stretched
tapestries
of
austere
design
there
i
saw
canvases
of
the
highest
value
the
likes
of
which
i
had
marveled
at
in
private
european
collections
and
art
exhibitions
the
various
schools
of
the
old
masters
were

and
some
wonderful
miniature
statues
in

modeled
after
antiquitys
finest
originals
stood
on
their
pedestals
in
the
corners
of
this
magnificent
museum
as
the
nautiluss
commander
had
predicted
my
mind
was
already
starting
to
fall
into
that
promised
state
of
stunned
amazement
professor
this
strange
man
then
said
you
must
excuse
the
informality
with
which
i
receive
you
and
the
disorder
reigning
in
this
lounge
sir
i
replied
without
prying
into
who
you
are
might
i
venture
to
identify
you
as
an
artist
a
collector
sir
nothing
more
formerly
i
loved
acquiring
these
beautiful
works
created
by
the
hand
of
man
i
sought
them
greedily
ferreted
them
out
tirelessly
and
ive
been
able
to
gather
some
objects
of
great
value
theyre
my
last
mementos
of
those
shores
that
are
now
dead
for
me
in
my
eyes
your
modern
artists
are
already
as
old
as
the
ancients
theyve
existed
for
2000
or
3000
years
and
i
mix
them
up
in
my
mind
the
masters
are
ageless
what
about
these
composers
i
said
pointing
to
sheet

by
weber
rossini
mozart
beethoven
haydn
meyerbeer
hrold
wagner

and
a
number
of
others
scattered
over
a
full
size
pianoorgan
which
occupied
one
of
the
wall
panels
in
this
lounge
these
composers
captain
nemo
answered
me
are
the
contemporaries
of
orpheus
because
in
the
annals
of
the
dead
all
chronological
differences
fade
and
im
dead
professor
quite
as
dead
as
those
friends
of
yours
sleeping
six
feet
under
captain
nemo
fell
silent
and
seemed
lost
in
reverie
i
regarded
him
with
intense
excitement
silently
analyzing
his
strange
facial
expression
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
corner
of
a
valuable
mosaic
table
he
no
longer
saw
me
he
had
forgotten
my
very
presence
i
didnt
disturb
his
meditations
but
continued
to
pass
in
review
the
curiosities
that
enriched
this
lounge
after
the
works
of
art
natural
rarities
predominated
they
consisted
chiefly
of
plants
shells
and
other
exhibits
from

supplied
by
the
biggest
mollusk
in
the
class
acephala
measured
about
six
meters
in

so
it
was
even

than
those
fine
giant
clams
given
to

by
the

which
the

gigantic

elegant

to
be
unrivaled
in

consequently
to
calculate
the
value
of
this
collection
was
i
should
say
impossible
captain
nemo
must
have
spent
millions
in
acquiring
these
different
specimens
and
i
was
wondering
what
financial
resources
he
tapped
to
satisfy
his
collectors
fancies
when
these
words
interrupted
me
youre
examining
my
shells
professor
theyre
indeed
able
to
fascinate
a
naturalist
but
for
me
they
have
an
added
charm
since
ive
collected
every
one
of
them
with
my
own
two
hands
and
not
a
sea
on
the
globe
has
escaped
my
investigations
i
understand
captain
i
understand
your
delight
at
strolling
in
the
midst
of
this
wealth
youre
a
man
who
gathers
his
treasure
in
person
no
museum
in
europe
owns
such
a
collection
of
exhibits
from
the
ocean
but
if
i
exhaust
all
my
wonderment
on
them
ill
have
nothing
left
for
the
ship
that
carries
them
i
have
absolutely
no
wish
to
probe
those
secrets
of
yours
but
i
confess
that
my
curiosity
is
aroused
to
the
limit
by
this
nautilus
the
motor
power
it
contains
the
equipment
enabling
it
to
operate
the
ultra
powerful
force
that
brings
it
to
life
i
see
some
instruments
hanging
on
the
walls
of
this
lounge
whose
purposes
are
unknown
to
me
may
i
learn
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
answered
me
ive
said
youd
be
free
aboard
my
vessel
so
no
part
of
the
nautilus
is
offlimits
to
you
you
may
inspect
it
in
detail
and
ill
be
delighted
to
act
as
your
guide
i
dont
know
how
to
thank
you
sir
but
i
wont
abuse
your
good
nature
i
would
only
ask
you
about
the
uses
intended
for
these
instruments
of
physical
measure
professor
these
same
instruments
are
found
in
my
stateroom
where
ill
have
the
pleasure
of
explaining
their
functions
to
you
but
beforehand
come
inspect
the
cabin
set
aside
for
you
you
need
to
learn
how
youll
be
lodged
aboard
the
nautilus
i
followed
captain
nemo
who
via
one
of
the
doors
cut
into
the
lounges
canted
corners
led
me
back
down
the
ships
gangways
he
took
me
to
the
bow
and
there
i
found
not
just
a
cabin
but
an
elegant
stateroom
with
a
bed
a
washstand
and
various
other
furnishings
i
could
only
thank
my
host
your
stateroom
adjoins
mine
he
told
me
opening
a
door
and
mine
leads
into
that
lounge
weve
just
left
i
entered
the
captains
stateroom
it
had
an
austere
almost
monastic
appearance
an
iron
bedstead
a
worktable
some
washstand
fixtures
subdued
lighting
no
luxuries
just
the
bare
necessities
captain
nemo
showed
me
to
a
bench
kindly
be
seated
he
told
me
i
sat
and
he
began
speaking
as
follows
chapter
12
everything
through
electricity
sir
captain
nemo
said
showing
me
the
instruments
hanging
on
the
walls
of
his
stateroom
these
are
the
devices
needed
to
navigate
the
nautilus
here
as
in
the
lounge
i
always
have
them
before
my
eyes
and
they
indicate
my
position
and
exact
heading
in
the
midst
of
the
ocean
youre
familiar
with
some
of
them
such
as
the
thermometer
which
gives
the
temperature
inside
the
nautilus
the
barometer
which
measures
the
heaviness
of
the
outside
air
and
forecasts
changes
in
the
weather
the
humidistat
which
indicates
the
degree
of
dryness
in
the
atmosphere
the
storm
glass
whose
mixture
decomposes
to
foretell
the
arrival
of
tempests
the
compass
which
steers
my
course
the
sextant
which
takes
the
suns
altitude
and
tells
me
my
latitude
chronometers
which
allow
me
to
calculate
my
longitude
and
finally
spyglasses
for
both
day
and
night
enabling
me
to
scrutinize
every
point
of
the
horizon
once
the
nautilus
has
risen
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
these
are
the
normal
navigational
instruments
i
replied
and
im
familiar
with
their
uses
but
no
doubt
these
others
answer
pressing
needs
unique
to
the
nautilus
that
dial
i
see
there
with
the
needle
moving
across
itisnt
it
a
pressure
gauge
it
is
indeed
a
pressure
gauge
its
placed
in
contact
with
the
water
and
it
indicates
the
outside
pressure
on
our
hull
which
in
turn
gives
me
the
depth
at
which
my
submersible
is
sitting
and
these
are
some
new
breed
of
sounding
line
theyre
thermometric
sounding
lines
that
report
water
temperatures
in
the
different
strata
and
these
other
instruments
whose
functions
i
cant
even
guess
here
professor
i
need
to
give
you
some
background
information
captain
nemo
said
so
kindly
hear
me
out
he
fell
silent
for
some
moments
then
he
said
theres
a
powerful
obedient
swift
and
effortless
force
that
can
be
bent
to
any
use
and
which
reigns
supreme
aboard
my
vessel
it
does
everything
it
lights
me
it
warms
me
its
the
soul
of
my
mechanical
equipment
this
force
is
electricity
electricity
i
exclaimed
in
some
surprise
yes
sir
but
captain
you
have
a
tremendous
speed
of
movement
that
doesnt
square
with
the
strength
of
electricity
until
now
its
dynamic
potential
has
remained
quite
limited
capable
of
producing
only
small
amounts
of
power
professor
captain
nemo
replied
my
electricity
isnt
the
runofthemill
variety
and
with
your
permission
ill
leave
it
at
that
i
wont
insist
sir
and
ill
rest
content
with
simply
being
flabbergasted
at
your
results
i
would
ask
one
question
however
which
you
neednt
answer
if
its
indiscreet
the
electric
cells
you
use
to
generate
this
marvelous
force
must
be
depleted
very
quickly
their
zinc
component
for
example
how
do
you
replace
it
since
you
no
longer
stay
in
contact
with
the
shore
that
question
deserves
an
answer
captain
nemo
replied
first
off
ill
mention
that
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
there
exist
veins
of
zinc
iron
silver
and
gold
whose
mining
would
quite
certainly
be
feasible
but
ive
tapped
none
of
these
landbased
metals
and
i
wanted
to
make
demands
only
on
the
sea
itself
for
the
sources
of
my
electricity
the
sea
itself
yes
professor
and
there
was
no
shortage
of
such
sources
in
fact
by
establishing
a
circuit
between
two
wires
immersed
to
different
depths
id
be
able
to
obtain
electricity
through
the
diverging
temperatures
they
experience
but
i
preferred
to
use
a
more
practical
procedure
and
that
is
youre
familiar
with
the
composition
of
salt
water
in
1000
grams
one
finds
965
water
and
about
266
sodium
chloride
then
small
quantities
of
magnesium
chloride
potassium
chloride
magnesium
bromide
sulfate
of
magnesia
calcium
sulfate
and
calcium
carbonate
hence
you
observe
that
sodium
chloride
is
encountered
there
in
significant
proportions
now
then
its
this
sodium
that
i
extract
from
salt
water
and
with
which
i
compose
my
electric
cells
sodium
yes
sir
mixed
with
mercury
it
forms
an
amalgam
that
takes
the
place
of
zinc
in
bunsen
cells
the
mercury
is
never
depleted
only
the
sodium
is
consumed
and
the
sea
itself
gives
me
that
beyond
this
ill
mention
that
sodium
batteries
have
been
found
to
generate
the
greater
energy
and
their
electromotor
strength
is
twice
that
of
zinc
batteries
captain
i
fully
understand
the
excellence
of
sodium
under
the
conditions
in
which
youre
placed
the
sea
contains
it
fine
but
it
still
has
to
be
produced
in
short
extracted
and
how
do
you
accomplish
this
obviously
your
batteries
could
do
the
extracting
but
if
im
not
mistaken
the
consumption
of
sodium
needed
by
your
electric
equipment
would
be
greater
than
the
quantity
youd
extract
it
would
come
about
then
that
in
the
process
of
producing
your
sodium
youd
use
up
more
than
youd
make
accordingly
professor
i
dont
extract
it
with
batteries
quite
simply
i
utilize
the
heat
of
coal
from
the
earth
from
the
earth
i
said
my
voice
going
up
on
the
word
well
say
coal
from
the
seafloor
if
you
prefer
captain
nemo
replied
and
you
can
mine
these
veins
of
underwater
coal
youll
watch
me
work
them
professor
aronnax
i
ask
only
a
little
patience
of
you
since
youll
have
ample
time
to
be
patient
just
remember
one
thing
i
owe
everything
to
the
ocean
it
generates
electricity
and
electricity
gives
the
nautilus
heat
light
motion
and
in
a
word
life
itself
but
not
the
air
you
breathe
oh
i
could
produce
the
air
needed
on
board
but
it
would
be
pointless
since
i
can
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
whenever
i
like
however
even
though
electricity
doesnt
supply
me
with
breathable
air
it
at
least
operates
the
powerful
pumps
that
store
it
under
pressure
in
special
tanks
which
if
need
be
allows
me
to
extend
my
stay
in
the
lower
strata
for
as
long
as
i
want
captain
i
replied
ill
rest
content
with
marveling
youve
obviously
found
what
all
mankind
will
surely
find
one
day
the
true
dynamic
power
of
electricity
im
not
so
certain
theyll
find
it
captain
nemo
replied
icily
but
be
that
as
it
may
youre
already
familiar
with
the
first
use
ive
found
for
this
valuable
force
it
lights
us
and
with
a
uniformity
and
continuity
not
even
possessed
by
sunlight
now
look
at
that
clock
its
electric
it
runs
with
an
accuracy
rivaling
the
finest
chronometers
ive
had
it
divided
into
twentyfour
hours
like
italian
clocks
since
neither
day
nor
night
sun
nor
moon
exist
for
me
but
only
this
artificial
light
that
i
import
into
the
depths
of
the
seas
see
right
now
its
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
thats
perfect
another
use
for
electricity
that
dial
hanging
before
our
eyes
indicates
how
fast
the
nautilus
is
going
an
electric
wire
puts
it
in
contact
with
the
patent
log
this
needle
shows
me
the
actual
speed
of
my
submersible
and



hold
on



just
now
were
proceeding
at
the
moderate
pace
of
fifteen
miles
per
hour
its
marvelous
i
replied
and
i
truly
see
captain
how
right
you
are
to
use
this
force
its
sure
to
take
the
place
of
wind
water
and
steam
but
thats
not
all
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
said
standing
up
and
if
youd
care
to
follow
me
well
inspect
the
nautiluss
stern
in
essence
i
was
already
familiar
with
the
whole
forward
part
of
this
underwater
boat
and
here
are
its
exact
subdivisions
going
from
amidships
to
its
spur
the
dining
room
5
meters
long
and
separated
from
the
library
by
a
watertight
bulkhead
in
other
words
it
couldnt
be
penetrated
by
the
sea
the
library
5
meters
long
the
main
lounge
10
meters
long
separated
from
the
captains
stateroom
by
a
second
watertight
bulkhead
the
aforesaid
stateroom
5
meters
long
mine
25
meters
long
and
finally
air
tanks
75
meters
long
and
extending
to
the
stempost
total
a
length
of
35
meters
doors
were
cut
into
the
watertight
bulkheads
and
were
shut
hermetically
by
means
of
indiarubber
seals
which
insured
complete
safety
aboard
the
nautilus
in
the
event
of
a
leak
in
any
one
section
i
followed
captain
nemo
down
gangways
located
for
easy
transit
and
i
arrived
amidships
there
i
found
a
sort
of
shaft
heading
upward
between
two
watertight
bulkheads
an
iron
ladder
clamped
to
the
wall
led
to
the
shafts
upper
end
i
asked
the
captain
what
this
ladder
was
for
it
goes
to
the
skiff
he
replied
what
you
have
a
skiff
i
replied
in
some
astonishment
surely
an
excellent
longboat
light
and
unsinkable
which
is
used
for
excursions
and
fishing
trips
but
when
you
want
to
set
out
dont
you
have
to
return
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
by
no
means
the
skiff
is
attached
to
the
topside
of
the
nautiluss
hull
and
is
set
in
a
cavity
expressly
designed
to
receive
it
its
completely
decked
over
absolutely
watertight
and
held
solidly
in
place
by
bolts
this
ladder
leads
to
a
manhole
cut
into
the
nautiluss
hull
and
corresponding
to
a
comparable
hole
cut
into
the
side
of
the
skiff
i
insert
myself
through
this
double
opening
into
the
longboat
my
crew
close
up
the
hole
belonging
to
the
nautilus
i
close
up
the
one
belonging
to
the
skiff
simply
by
screwing
it
into
place
i
undo
the
bolts
holding
the
skiff
to
the
submersible
and
the
longboat
rises
with
prodigious
speed
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
i
then
open
the
deck
paneling
carefully
closed
until
that
point
i
up
mast
and
hoist
sailor
i
take
out
my
oarsand
i
go
for
a
spin
but
how
do
you
return
to
the
ship
i
dont
professor
aronnax
the
nautilus
returns
to
me
at
your
command
at
my
command
an
electric
wire
connects
me
to
the
ship
i
fire
off
a
telegram
and
thats
that
right
i
said
tipsy
from
all
these
wonders
nothing
to
it
after
passing
the
well
of
the
companionway
that
led
to
the
platform
i
saw
a
cabin
2
meters
long
in
which
conseil
and
ned
land
enraptured
with
their
meal
were
busy
devouring
it
to
the
last
crumb
then
a
door
opened
into
the
galley
3
meters
long
and
located
between
the
vessels
huge
storage
lockers
there
even
more
powerful
and
obedient
than
gas
electricity
did
most
of
the
cooking
arriving
under
the
stoves
wires
transmitted
to
platinum
griddles
a
heat
that
was
distributed
and
sustained
with
perfect
consistency
it
also
heated
a
distilling
mechanism
that
via
evaporation
supplied
excellent
drinking
water
next
to
this
galley
was
a
bathroom
conveniently
laid
out
with
faucets
supplying
hot
or
cold
water
at
will
after
the
galley
came
the
crews
quarters
5
meters
long
but
the
door
was
closed
and
i
couldnt
see
its
accommodations
which
might
have
told
me
the
number
of
men
it
took
to
operate
the
nautilus
at
the
far
end
stood
a
fourth
watertight
bulkhead
separating
the
crews
quarters
from
the
engine
room
a
door
opened
and
i
stood
in
the
compartment
where
captain
nemo
indisputably
a
worldclass
engineer
had
set
up
his
locomotive
equipment
brightly
lit
the
engine
room
measured
at
least
20
meters
in
length
it
was
divided
by
function
into
two
parts
the
first
contained
the
cells
for
generating
electricity
the
second
that
mechanism
transmitting
movement
to
the
propeller
right
off
i
detected
an
odor
permeating
the
compartment
that
was
sui
generis
captain
nemo
noticed
the
negative
impression
it
made
on
me
latin
in
a
class
by
itself
ed
that
he
told
me
is
a
gaseous
discharge
caused
by
our
use
of
sodium
but
its
only
a
mild
inconvenience
in
any
event
every
morning
we
sanitize
the
ship
by
ventilating
it
in
the
open
air
meanwhile
i
examined
the
nautiluss
engine
with
a
fascination
easy
to
imagine
you
observe
captain
nemo
told
me
that
i
use
bunsen
cells
not
ruhmkorff
cells
the
latter
would
be
ineffectual
one
uses
fewer
bunsen
cells
but
theyre
big
and
strong
and
experience
has
proven
their
superiority
the
electricity
generated
here
makes
its
way
to
the
stern
where
electromagnets
of
huge
size
activate
a
special
system
of
levers
and
gears
that
transmit
movement
to
the
propellers
shaft
the
latter
has
a
diameter
of
6
meters
a
pitch
of
75
meters
and
can
do
up
to
120
revolutions
per
minute
and
that
gives
you
a
speed
of
fifty
miles
per
hour
there
lay
a
mystery
but
i
didnt
insist
on
exploring
it
how
could
electricity
work
with
such
power
where
did
this
nearly
unlimited
energy
originate
was
it
in
the
extraordinary
voltage
obtained
from
some
new
kind
of
induction
coil
could
its
transmission
have
been
immeasurably
increased
by
some
unknown
system
of
levers
this
was
the
point
i
couldnt
grasp
authors
note
and
sure
enough
theres
now
talk
of
such
a
discovery
in
which
a
new
set
of
levers
generates
considerable
power
did
its
inventor
meet
up
with
captain
nemo
captain
nemo
i
said
ill
vouch
for
the
results
and
not
try
to
explain
them
ive
seen
the
nautilus
at
work
out
in
front
of
the
abraham
lincoln
and
i
know
where
i
stand
on
its
speed
but
it
isnt
enough
just
to
move
we
have
to
see
where
were
going
we
must
be
able
to
steer
right
or
left
up
or
down
how
do
you
reach
the
lower
depths
where
you
meet
an
increasing
resistance
thats
assessed
in
hundreds
of
atmospheres
how
do
you
rise
back
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
finally
how
do
you
keep
your
ship
at
whatever
level
suits
you
am
i
indiscreet
in
asking
you
all
these
things
not
at
all
professor
the
captain
answered
me
after
a
slight
hesitation
since
youll
never
leave
this
underwater
boat
come
into
the
lounge
its
actually
our
work
room
and
there
youll
learn
the
full
story
about
the
nautilus
chapter
13
some
figures
a
moment
later
we
were
seated
on
a
couch
in
the
lounge
cigars
between
our
lips
the
captain
placed
before
my
eyes
a
working
drawing
that
gave
the
ground
plan
cross
section
and
side
view
of
the
nautilus
then
he
began
his
description
as
follows
here
professor
aronnax
are
the
different
dimensions
of
this
boat
now
transporting
you
its
a
very
long
cylinder
with
conical
ends
it
noticeably
takes
the
shape
of
a
cigar
a
shape
already
adopted
in
london
for
several
projects
of
the
same
kind
the
length
of
this
cylinder
from
end
to
end
is
exactly
seventy
meters
and
its
maximum
breadth
of
beam
is
eight
meters
so
it
isnt
quite
built
on
the
tentoone
ratio
of
your
highspeed
steamers
but
its
lines
are
sufficiently
long
and
their
tapering
gradual
enough
so
that
the
displaced
water
easily
slips
past
and
poses
no
obstacle
to
the
ships
movements
these
two
dimensions
allow
you
to
obtain
via
a
simple
calculation
the
surface
area
and
volume
of
the
nautilus
its
surface
area
totals
101145
square
meters
its
volume
15072
cubic
meterswhich
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
when
its
completely
submerged
it
displaces
1500
cubic
meters
of
water
or
weighs
1500
metric
tons
in
drawing
up
plans
for
a
ship
meant
to
navigate
underwater
i
wanted
it
when
floating
on
the
waves
to
lie
ninetenths
below
the
surface
and
to
emerge
only
onetenth
consequently
under
these
conditions
it
needed
to
displace
only
ninetenths
of
its
volume
hence
135648
cubic
meters
in
other
words
it
was
to
weigh
only
that
same
number
of
metric
tons
so
i
was
obliged
not
to
exceed
this
weight
while
building
it
to
the
aforesaid
dimensions
the
nautilus
is
made
up
of
two
hulls
one
inside
the
other
between
them
joining
them
together
are
iron
tbars
that
give
this
ship
the
utmost
rigidity
in
fact
thanks
to
this
cellular
arrangement
it
has
the
resistance
of
a
stone
block
as
if
it
were
completely
solid
its
plating
cant
give
way
its
selfadhering
and
not
dependent
on
the
tightness
of
its
rivets
and
due
to
the
perfect
union
of
its
materials
the
solidarity
of
its
construction
allows
it
to
defy
the
most
violent
seas
the
two
hulls
are
manufactured
from
boilerplate
steel
whose
relative
density
is
78
times
that
of
water
the
first
hull
has
a
thickness
of
no
less
than
five
centimeters
and
weighs
39496
metric
tons
my
second
hull
the
outer
cover
includes
a
keel
fifty
centimeters
high
by
twentyfive
wide
which
by
itself
weighs
62
metric
tons
this
hull
the
engine
the
ballast
the
various
accessories
and
accommodations
plus
the
bulkheads
and
interior
braces
have
a
combined
weight
of
96152
metric
tons
which
when
added
to
39496
metric
tons
gives
us
the
desired
total
of
135648
metric
tons
clear
clear
i
replied
so
the
captain
went
on
when
the
nautilus
lies
on
the
waves
under
these
conditions
onetenth
of
it
does
emerge
above
water
now
then
if
i
provide
some
ballast
tanks
equal
in
capacity
to
that
onetenth
hence
able
to
hold
15072
metric
tons
and
if
i
fill
them
with
water
the
boat
then
displaces
15072
metric
tonsor
it
weighs
that
muchand
it
would
be
completely
submerged
thats
what
comes
about
professor
these
ballast
tanks
exist
within
easy
access
in
the
lower
reaches
of
the
nautilus
i
open
some
stopcocks
the
tanks
fill
the
boat
sinks
and
its
exactly
flush
with
the
surface
of
the
water
fine
captain
but
now
we
come
to
a
genuine
difficulty
youre
able
to
lie
flush
with
the
surface
of
the
ocean
that
i
understand
but
lower
down
while
diving
beneath
that
surface
isnt
your
submersible
going
to
encounter
a
pressure
and
consequently
undergo
an
upward
thrust
that
must
be
assessed
at
one
atmosphere
per
every
thirty
feet
of
water
hence
at
about
one
kilogram
per
each
square
centimeter
precisely
sir
then
unless
you
fill
up
the
whole
nautilus
i
dont
see
how
you
can
force
it
down
into
the
heart
of
these
liquid
masses
professor
captain
nemo
replied
static
objects
mustnt
be
confused
with
dynamic
ones
or
well
be
open
to
serious
error
comparatively
little
effort
is
spent
in
reaching
the
oceans
lower
regions
because
all
objects
have
a
tendency
to
become
sinkers
follow
my
logic
here
im
all
ears
captain
when
i
wanted
to
determine
what
increase
in
weight
the
nautilus
needed
to
be
given
in
order
to
submerge
i
had
only
to
take
note
of
the
proportionate
reduction
in
volume
that
salt
water
experiences
in
deeper
and
deeper
strata
thats
obvious
i
replied
now
then
if
water
isnt
absolutely
incompressible
at
least
it
compresses
very
little
in
fact
according
to
the
most
recent
calculations
this
reduction
is
only
0000436
per
atmosphere
or
per
every
thirty
feet
of
depth
for
instance
to
go
1000
meters
down
i
must
take
into
account
the
reduction
in
volume
that
occurs
under
a
pressure
equivalent
to
that
from
a
1000meter
column
of
water
in
other
words
under
a
pressure
of
100
atmospheres
in
this
instance
the
reduction
would
be
00436
consequently
id
have
to
increase
my
weight
from
15072
metric
tons
to
151377
so
the
added
weight
would
only
be
657
metric
tons
thats
all
thats
all
professor
aronnax
and
the
calculation
is
easy
to
check
now
then
i
have
supplementary
ballast
tanks
capable
of
shipping
100
metric
tons
of
water
so
i
can
descend
to
considerable
depths
when
i
want
to
rise
again
and
lie
flush
with
the
surface
all
i
have
to
do
is
expel
that
water
and
if
i
desire
that
the
nautilus
emerge
above
the
waves
to
onetenth
of
its
total
capacity
i
empty
all
the
ballast
tanks
completely
this
logic
backed
up
by
figures
left
me
without
a
single
objection
i
accept
your
calculations
captain
i
replied
and
id
be
illmannered
to
dispute
them
since
your
daily
experience
bears
them
out
but
at
this
juncture
i
have
a
hunch
that
were
still
left
with
one
real
difficulty
whats
that
sir
when
youre
at
a
depth
of
1000
meters
the
nautiluss
plating
bears
a
pressure
of
100
atmospheres
if
at
this
point
you
want
to
empty
the
supplementary
ballast
tanks
in
order
to
lighten
your
boat
and
rise
to
the
surface
your
pumps
must
overcome
that
pressure
of
100
atmospheres
which
is
100
kilograms
per
each
square
centimeter
this
demands
a
strength
that
electricity
alone
can
give
me
captain
nemo
said
swiftly
sir
i
repeat
the
dynamic
power
of
my
engines
is
nearly
infinite
the
nautiluss
pumps
have
prodigious
strength
as
you
must
have
noticed
when
their
waterspouts
swept
like
a
torrent
over
the
abraham
lincoln
besides
i
use
my
supplementary
ballast
tanks
only
to
reach
an
average
depth
of
1500
to
2000
meters
and
that
with
a
view
to
conserving
my
machinery
accordingly
when
i
have
a
mind
to
visit
the
ocean
depths
two
or
three
vertical
leagues
beneath
the
surface
i
use
maneuvers
that
are
more
timeconsuming
but
no
less
infallible
what
are
they
captain
i
asked
here
im
naturally
led
into
telling
you
how
the
nautilus
is
maneuvered
i
cant
wait
to
find
out
in
order
to
steer
this
boat
to
port
or
starboard
in
short
to
make
turns
on
a
horizontal
plane
i
use
an
ordinary
widebladed
rudder
thats
fastened
to
the
rear
of
the
sternpost
and
worked
by
a
wheel
and
tackle
but
i
can
also
move
the
nautilus
upward
and
downward
on
a
vertical
plane
by
the
simple
method
of
slanting
its
two
fins
which
are
attached
to
its
sides
at
its
center
of
flotation
these
fins
are
flexible
able
to
assume
any
position
and
can
be
operated
from
inside
by
means
of
powerful
levers
if
these
fins
stay
parallel
with
the
boat
the
latter
moves
horizontally
if
they
slant
the
nautilus
follows
the
angle
of
that
slant
and
under
its
propellers
thrust
either
sinks
on
a
diagonal
as
steep
as
it
suits
me
or
rises
on
that
diagonal
and
similarly
if
i
want
to
return
more
swiftly
to
the
surface
i
throw
the
propeller
in
gear
and
the
waters
pressure
makes
the
nautilus
rise
vertically
as
an
air
balloon
inflated
with
hydrogen
lifts
swiftly
into
the
skies
bravo
captain
i
exclaimed
but
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
how
can
your
helmsman
follow
the
course
youve
given
him
my
helmsman
is
stationed
behind
the
windows
of
a
pilothouse
which
protrudes
from
the
topside
of
the
nautiluss
hull
and
is
fitted
with
biconvex
glass
is
glass
capable
of
resisting
such
pressures
perfectly
capable
though
fragile
on
impact
crystal
can
still
offer
considerable
resistance
in
1864
during
experiments
on
fishing
by
electric
light
in
the
middle
of
the
north
sea
glass
panes
less
than
seven
millimeters
thick
were
seen
to
resist
a
pressure
of
sixteen
atmospheres
all
the
while
letting
through
strong
heatgenerating
rays
whose
warmth
was
unevenly
distributed
now
then
i
use
glass
windows
measuring
no
less
than
twentyone
centimeters
at
their
centers
in
other
words
theyve
thirty
times
the
thickness
fair
enough
captain
but
if
were
going
to
see
we
need
light
to
drive
away
the
dark
and
in
the
midst
of
the
murky
waters
i
wonder
how
your
helmsman
can
set
astern
of
the
pilothouse
is
a
powerful
electric
reflector
whose
rays
light
up
the
sea
for
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
oh
bravo
bravo
three
times
over
captain
that
explains
the
phosphorescent
glow
from
this
socalled
narwhale
that
so
puzzled
us
scientists
pertinent
to
this
ill
ask
you
if
the
nautiluss
running
afoul
of
the
scotia
which
caused
such
a
great
uproar
was
the
result
of
an
accidental
encounter
entirely
accidental
sir
i
was
navigating
two
meters
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
when
the
collision
occurred
however
i
could
see
that
it
had
no
dire
consequences
none
sir
but
as
for
your
encounter
with
the
abraham
lincoln




professor
that
troubled
me
because
its
one
of
the
best
ships
in
the
gallant
american
navy
but
they
attacked
me
and
i
had
to
defend
myself
all
the
same
i
was
content
simply
to
put
the
frigate
in
a
condition
where
it
could
do
me
no
harm
it
wont
have
any
difficulty
getting
repairs
at
the
nearest
port
ah
commander
i
exclaimed
with
conviction
your
nautilus
is
truly
a
marvelous
boat
yes
professor
captain
nemo
replied
with
genuine
excitement
and
i
love
it
as
if
it
were
my
own
flesh
and
blood
aboard
a
conventional
ship
facing
the
oceans
perils
danger
lurks
everywhere
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
your
chief
sensation
is
the
constant
feeling
of
an
underlying
chasm
as
the
dutchman
jansen
so
aptly
put
it
but
below
the
waves
aboard
the
nautilus
your
heart
never
fails
you
there
are
no
structural
deformities
to
worry
about
because
the
double
hull
of
this
boat
has
the
rigidity
of
iron
no
rigging
to
be
worn
out
by
rolling
and
pitching
on
the
waves
no
sails
for
the
wind
to
carry
off
no
boilers
for
steam
to
burst
open
no
fires
to
fear
because
this
submersible
is
made
of
sheet
iron
not
wood
no
coal
to
run
out
of
since
electricity
is
its
mechanical
force
no
collisions
to
fear
because
it
navigates
the
watery
deep
all
by
itself
no
storms
to
brave
because
just
a
few
meters
beneath
the
waves
it
finds
absolute
tranquility
there
sir
theres
the
ideal
ship
and
if
its
true
that
the
engineer
has
more
confidence
in
a
craft
than
the
builder
and
the
builder
more
than
the
captain
himself
you
can
understand
the
utter
abandon
with
which
i
place
my
trust
in
this
nautilus
since
im
its
captain
builder
and
engineer
all
in
one
captain
nemo
spoke
with
winning
eloquence
the
fire
in
his
eyes
and
the
passion
in
his
gestures
transfigured
him
yes
he
loved
his
ship
the
same
way
a
father
loves
his
child
but
one
question
perhaps
indiscreet
naturally
popped
up
and
i
couldnt
resist
asking
it
youre
an
engineer
then
captain
nemo
yes
professor
he
answered
me
i
studied
in
london
paris
and
new
york
back
in
the
days
when
i
was
a
resident
of
the
earths
continents
but
how
were
you
able
to
build
this
wonderful
nautilus
in
secret
each
part
of
it
professor
aronnax
came
from
a
different
spot
on
the
globe
and
reached
me
at
a
cover
address
its
keel
was
forged
by
creusot
in
france
its
propeller
shaft
by
pen

co
in
london
the
sheetiron
plates
for
its
hull
by
lairds
in
liverpool
its
propeller
by
scotts
in
glasgow
its
tanks
were
manufactured
by
cail

co
in
paris
its
engine
by
krupp
in
prussia
its
spur
by
the
motala
workshops
in
sweden
its
precision
instruments
by
hart
bros
in
new
york
etc
and
each
of
these
suppliers
received
my
specifications
under
a
different
name
but
i
went
on
once
these
parts
were
manufactured
didnt
they
have
to
be
mounted
and
adjusted
professor
i
set
up
my
workshops
on
a
deserted
islet
in
midocean
there
our
nautilus
was
completed
by
me
and
my
workmen
in
other
words
by
my
gallant
companions
whom
ive
molded
and
educated
then
when
the
operation
was
over
we
burned
every
trace
of
our
stay
on
that
islet
which
if
i
could
have
id
have
blown
up
from
all
this
may
i
assume
that
such
a
boat
costs
a
fortune
an
iron
ship
professor
aronnax
runs
1125
francs
per
metric
ton
now
then
the
nautilus
has
a
burden
of
1500
metric
tons
consequently
it
cost
1687000
francs
hence
2000000
francs
including
its
accommodations
and
4000000
or
5000000
with
all
the
collections
and
works
of
art
it
contains
one
last
question
captain
nemo
ask
professor
youre
rich
then
infinitely
rich
sir
and
without
any
trouble
i
could
pay
off
the
tenbillionfranc
french
national
debt
i
gaped
at
the
bizarre
individual
who
had
just
spoken
these
words
was
he
playing
on
my
credulity
time
would
tell
chapter
14
the
black
current
the
part
of
the
planet
earth
that
the
seas
occupy
has
been
assessed
at
3832558
square
myriameters
hence
more
than
38000000000
hectares
this
liquid
mass
totals
2250000000
cubic
miles
and
could
form
a
sphere
with
a
diameter
of
sixty
leagues
whose
weight
would
be
three
quintillion
metric
tons
to
appreciate
such
a
number
we
should
remember
that
a
quintillion
is
to
a
billion
what
a
billion
is
to
one
in
other
words
there
are
as
many
billions
in
a
quintillion
as
ones
in
a
billion
now
then
this
liquid
mass
nearly
equals
the
total
amount
of
water
that
has
poured
through
all
the
earths
rivers
for
the
past
40000
years
during
prehistoric
times
an
era
of
fire
was
followed
by
an
era
of
water
at
first
there
was

then
during
the
silurian
period
the

gradually
appeared

the

islands
emerged

beneath
temporary

rose
again
were
fused
to
form

and
finally
the

geography
settled
into
what
we
have
today
solid

had
wrested
from

and
this
was
the

was

cross
under
these
strangest
of
auspices
if
you
dont
mind
professor
captain
nemo
told
me
well
determine
our
exact
position
and
fix
the
starting
point
of
our
voyage
its
fifteen
minutes
before
noon
im
going
to
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
water
the
captain
pressed
an
electric
bell
three
times
the
pumps
began
to
expel
water
from
the
ballast
tanks
on
the
pressure
gauge
a
needle
marked
the
decreasing
pressures
that
indicated
the
nautiluss
upward
progress
then
the
needle
stopped
here
we
are
the
captain
said
i
made
my
way
to
the
central
companionway
which
led
to
the
platform
i
climbed
its
metal
steps
passed
through
the
open
hatches
and
arrived
topside
on
the
nautilus
the
platform
emerged
only
eighty
centimeters
above
the
waves
the
nautiluss
bow
and
stern
boasted
that
spindleshaped
outline
that
had
caused
the
ship
to
be
compared
appropriately
to
a
long
cigar
i
noted
the
slight
overlap
of
its
sheetiron
plates
which
resembled
the
scales
covering
the
bodies
of
our
big
land
reptiles
so
i
had
a
perfectly
natural
explanation
for
why
despite
the
best
spyglasses
this
boat
had
always
been
mistaken
for
a
marine
animal
near
the
middle
of
the
platform
the
skiff
was
half
set
in
the
ships
hull
making
a
slight
bulge
fore
and
aft
stood
two
cupolas
of
moderate
height
their
sides
slanting
and
partly
inset
with
heavy
biconvex
glass
one
reserved
for
the
helmsman
steering
the
nautilus
the
other
for
the
brilliance
of
the
powerful
electric
beacon
lighting
his
way
the
sea
was
magnificent
the
skies
clear
this
long
aquatic
vehicle
could
barely
feel
the
broad
undulations
of
the
ocean
a
mild
breeze
out
of
the
east
rippled
the
surface
of
the
water
free
of
all
mist
the
horizon
was
ideal
for
taking
sights
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
not
a
reef
not
an
islet
no
more

raising
his

captain
nemo
took
the
altitude
of
the
sun
which
would
give
him
his
latitude
he
waited
for
a
few
minutes
until
the
orb
touched
the
rim
of
the
horizon
while
he
was
taking
his
sights
he
didnt
move

he
said
professor
whenever
youre
ready



i
took
one
last
look
at
the
sea
a
little
yellowish
near
the
landing
places
of
japan
and
i
went
below
again
to
the
main
lounge
there
the
captain
fixed
his
position
and
used
a
chronometer
to
calculate
his
longitude
which
he
doublechecked
against
his
previous
observations
of
hour
angles
then
he
told
me
professor
aronnax
were
in
longitude
137
degrees
15
west
west
of
which
meridian
i
asked
quickly
hoping
the
captains
reply
might
give
me
a
clue
to
his
nationality
sir
he
answered
me
i
have
chronometers
variously
set
to
the
meridians
of
paris
greenwich
and
washington
dc
but
in
your
honor
ill
use
the
one
for
paris
this
reply
told
me
nothing
i
bowed
and
the
commander
went
on
were
in
longitude
137
degrees
15
west
of
the
meridian
of

hereby
begin
our
voyage

exploration
under
the
waters
may
god
be

us
i
replied
and
now
professor
the
captain
added
ill
leave
you
to
your
intellectual
pursuits
ive
set
our
course

at
a
depth
of
fifty

here
are
some
largescale

youll
be
able
to
follow
that
course
the
lounge
is
at
your
disposal
and
with
your
permission
ill
take
my
leave
captain
nemo
bowed
i
was
left
to
myself
lost
in
my
thoughts
they
all
centered
on
the
nautiluss
commander
would
i
ever
learn
the
nationality
of
this
eccentric
man
who
had
boasted
of
having
none
his
sworn
hate
for
humanity
a
hate
that
perhaps
was
bent
on
some
dreadful
revengewhat
had
provoked
it
was
he
one
of
those
unappreciated
scholars
one
of
those
geniuses
embittered
by
the
world
as
conseil
expressed
it
a
latterday
galileo
or
maybe
one
of
those
men
of
science
like
americas
commander
maury
whose
careers
were
ruined
by
political
revolutions
i
couldnt
say
yet
as
for
me
whom
fate
had
just
brought
aboard
his
vessel
whose
life
he
had
held
in
the
balance
he
had
received
me
coolly
but
hospitably
only
he
never
took
the
hand
i
extended
to
him
he
never
extended
his
own
for
an
entire
hour
i
was
deep
in
these
musings
trying
to
probe
this
mystery
that
fascinated
me
so
then
my
eyes
focused
on
a
huge
world
map
displayed
on
the
table
and
i
put
my
finger
on
the
very
spot
where
our
justdetermined
longitude
and
latitude
intersected
like
the
continents
the
sea
has
its
rivers
these
are
exclusive
currents
that
can
be
identified
by
their
temperature
and
color
the
most
remarkable
being
the
one
called
the
gulf
stream
science
has
defined
the
global
paths
of
five
chief
currents
one
in
the
north
atlantic
a
second
in
the
south
atlantic
a
third
in
the
north
pacific
a
fourth
in
the
south
pacific
and
a
fifth
in
the
southern
indian
ocean
also
its
likely
that
a
sixth
current
used
to
exist
in
the
northern
indian
ocean
when
the
caspian
and
aral
seas
joined
up
with
certain
large
asian
lakes
to
form
a
single
uniform
expanse
of
water
now
then
at
the
spot
indicated
on
the
world
map
one
of
these
seagoing
rivers
was
rolling
by
the
kuroshio
of

by

up
the

and
curves
into
the
north

as
far
as
the
aleutian
islands
carrying
along
trunks
of
camphor
trees

other
local

with

the
nautilus
was
about
to
cross
i
watched
it
on
the
map
with
my
eyes
i
saw
it
lose
itself
in
the
immenseness
of
the
pacific
and
i
felt
myself
swept
along
with
it
when
ned

and
conseil
appeared
in
the

my

where
are

the
canadian
exclaimed
in
the
quebec
museum
begging
masters
pardon
conseil
answered
but
this
seems
more
like
the

my

i
replied
signaling
them
to
enter
youre
in
neither
canada
nor
france
but
securely
aboard
the
nautilus
fifty
meters
below
sea
level
if
master
says
so
then
so
be
it
conseil
answered
but
in
all
honesty
this
lounge
is
enough
to
astonish
even
someone
flemish
like
myself
indulge
your
astonishment
my
friend
and
have
a
look
because
theres
plenty
of
work
here
for
a
classifier
of
your
talents
conseil
needed
no
encouraging
bending
over
the

the

meanwhile
ned
land
less
dedicated
to
conchology
questioned
me
about
my
interview
with
captain
nemo
had
i
discovered
who
he
was
where
he
came
from
where
he
was
heading
how
deep
he
was
taking
us
in
short
a
thousand
questions
i
had
no
time
to
answer
i
told
him
everything
i
knewor
rather
everything
i
didnt
knowand
i
asked
him
what
he
had
seen
or
heard
on
his
part
havent
seen
or
heard
a
thing
the
canadian
replied
i
havent
even
spotted
the
crew
of
this
boat
by
any
chance
could
they
be
electric
too
electric
oh
ye
gods
im
half
tempted
to
believe
it
but
back
to
you
professor
aronnax
ned

said
still
hanging
on
to
his
ideas
cant
you

how
many

twenty
fifty
a

im
unable
to
answer
you
mr
land
and
trust
me
on
this
for
the
time
being
get
rid
of
these
notions
of
taking
over
the
nautilus
or
escaping
from
it
this
boat
is
a
masterpiece
of
modern
technology
and
id
be
sorry
to
have
missed
it
many
people
would
welcome
the
circumstances
that
have
been
handed
us
just
to
walk
in
the
midst
of
these
wonders
so
keep
calm
and
lets
see
whats
happening
around
us
see
the
harpooner
exclaimed
theres
nothing

nothing
well
ever

running

blindfolded
ned

was
just

when
we
were
suddenly
plunged
into
darkness
utter
darkness
the
ceiling
lights
went
out
so
quickly
my
eyes
literally
ached
just
as
if
we
had
experienced
the
opposite
sensation
of
going
from
the
deepest
gloom
to
the
brightest
sunlight
we
stood
stockstill
not
knowing
what
surprise
was
waiting
for
us
whether
pleasant
or
unpleasant
but
a
sliding
sound
became
audible
you
could
tell
that
some
panels
were
shifting
over
the
nautiluss
sides
its
the
beginning
of

conseil
muttered
suddenly
through
two
oblong
openings
daylight
appeared
on
both
sides
of
the
lounge
the
liquid
masses
came
into
view
brightly
lit
by
the
ships
electric
outpourings
we
were
separated
from
the
sea
by
two
panes
of
glass
initially
i
shuddered
at
the
thought
that
these
fragile
partitions
could
break
but
strong
copper
bands
secured
them
giving
them
nearly
infinite
resistance
the
sea
was
clearly
visible
for
a
onemile
radius
around
the
nautilus
what
a
sight
what
pen
could
describe
it
who
could
portray
the
effects
of
this
light
through
these
translucent
sheets
of
water
the
subtlety
of
its
progressive
shadings
into
the
oceans
upper
and
lower
strata
the
transparency
of
salt
water
has
long
been
recognized
its
clarity
is
believed
to
exceed
that
of
spring
water
the
mineral
and
organic
substances
it
holds
in
suspension
actually
increase
its
translucency
in
certain
parts
of
the
caribbean
sea
you
can
see
the
sandy
bottom
with
startling
distinctness
as
deep
as
145
meters
down
and
the
penetrating
power
of
the
suns
rays
seems
to
give
out
only
at
a
depth
of
300
meters
but
in
this
fluid
setting
traveled
by
the
nautilus
our
electric
glow
was
being
generated
in
the
very
heart
of
the
waves
it
was
no
longer
illuminated
water
it
was
liquid
light
if
we
accept
the
hypotheses
of
the
microbiologist
ehrenbergwho
believes
that
these
underwater
depths
are
lit
up
by

has
certainly
saved
one
of
her
most
prodigious
sights
for
residents
of
the
sea
and
i
could
judge
for
myself
from
the
thousandfold
play
of
the
light
on
both
sides
i
had
windows
opening
over
these
unexplored
depths
the
darkness
in
the
lounge
enhanced
the
brightness
outside
and
we
stared
as
if
this
clear
glass
were
the
window
of
an
immense
aquarium
the
nautilus
seemed
to
be
standing
still
this
was
due
to
the
lack
of
landmarks
but
streaks
of
water
parted
by
the
ships
spur
sometimes
threaded
before
our
eyes
with
extraordinary
speed
in
wonderment
we
leaned
on
our
elbows
before
these
show
windows
and
our
stunned
silence
remained
unbroken
until
conseil
said
you
wanted
to
see
something
ned
my
friend
well
now
you
have
something
to
see
how
unusual
the
canadian
put
in
setting
aside
his
tantrums
and
getaway
schemes
while
submitting
to
this
irresistible
allure
a
man
would
go
an
even
greater
distance
just
to
stare
at
such
a
sight
ah
i
exclaimed
i
see
our
captains
way
of
life
hes
found
himself
a
separate
world
that
saves
its
most
astonishing
wonders
just
for
him
but
where
are
the
fish
the
canadian
ventured
to
observe
i
dont
see
any
fish
why
would
you
care
ned
my
friend
conseil
replied
since
you
have
no
knowledge
of
them
me
a
fisherman
ned
land
exclaimed
and
on
this
subject
a
dispute
arose
between
the
two
friends
since
both
were
knowledgeable
about
fish
but
from
totally
different
standpoints
everyone
knows
that
fish
make
up
the
fourth
and
last
class
in
the
vertebrate
branch
they
have
been
quite
aptly
defined
as
coldblooded
vertebrates
with
a
double
circulatory
system
breathing
through
gills
and
designed
to
live
in
water
they
consist
of
two
distinct
series
the
series
of
bony
fish
in
other
words
those
whose
spines
have
vertebrae
made
of
bone
and
cartilaginous
fish
in
other
words
those
whose
spines
have
vertebrae
made
of
cartilage
possibly
the
canadian
was
familiar
with
this
distinction
but
conseil
knew
far
more
about
it
and
since
he
and
ned
were
now
fast
friends
he
just
had
to
show
off
so
he
told
the
harpooner
ned
my
friend
youre
a
slayer
of
fish
a
highly
skilled
fisherman
youve
caught
a
large
number
of
these
fascinating
animals
but
ill
bet
you
dont
know
how
theyre
classified
sure
i
do
the
harpooner
replied
in
all
seriousness
theyre
classified
into
fish
we
eat
and
fish
we
dont
eat
spoken
like
a
true
glutton
conseil
replied
but
tell
me
are
you
familiar
with
the
differences
between
bony
fish
and
cartilaginous
fish
just
maybe
conseil
and
how
about
the
subdivisions
of
these
two
large
classes
i
havent
the
foggiest
notion
the
canadian
replied
all
right
listen
and
learn
ned
my
friend
bony
fish
are
subdivided
into
six
orders
primo
the
acanthopterygians
whose
upper
jaw
is
fully
formed
and
freemoving
and
whose
gills
take
the
shape
of
a
comb
this
order
consists
of
fifteen
families
in
other
words
threequarters
of
all
known
fish

common
perch

abdomen
to
the
rear
of
the
pectorals
but
arent
attached
to
the
shoulder
bone
an
order
thats
divided
into
five
families
and
makes
up
the
great
majority
of
freshwater
fish
examples
carp
pike
ugh
the
canadian
put
in
with
distinct
scorn
you
can
keep
the
freshwater
fish
tertio
conseil
said
the
subbrachians
whose
pelvic
fins
are
attached
under
the
pectorals
and
hang
directly
from
the
shoulder

this

four
families

flatfish
such
as

excellent
really
excellent
the
harpooner
exclaimed
interested
in

only
from
an
edible
viewpoint
quarto
conseil
went
on
unabashed
the
apods
with
long
bodies
that
lack
pelvic
fins
and
are
covered
by
a
heavy
often
glutinous
skin
an

the
lophobranchians
which
have
fully
formed
freemoving
jaws
but
whose
gills
consist
of
little
tufts
arranged
in
pairs
along
their
gill
arches
this
order
includes
only
one
family
examples
seahorses
and
dragonfish
bad
very
bad
the
harpooner
replied
sexto
and
last
conseil
said
the
plectognaths
whose
maxillary
bone
is
firmly
attached
to
the
side
of
the
intermaxillary
that
forms
the
jaw
and
whose
palate
arch
is
locked
to
the
skull
by
sutures
that
render
the
jaw
immovable
an
order
lacking
true
pelvic
fins
and
which
consists
of
two
families
examples
puffers
and
moonfish
theyre
an
insult

the

grasping
all
this
ned
my

asked
the
scholarly
conseil
not
a
lick
of
it
conseil
my
friend
the
harpooner
replied
but
keep
going
because
you
fill
me
with
fascination
as
for
cartilaginous
fish
conseil
went
on
unflappably
they
consist

three
orders

put
in

the
cyclostomes
whose

into
a
flexible
ring
and
whose
gill
openings
are
simply
a
large
number
of

an
order

the

with
gills
resembling
those
of
the
cyclostomes
but
whose
lower
jaw
is
freemoving
this
order
which
is
the
most
important
in
the
class

the

my

i
wouldnt
advise
you
to

the
sturionians
whose
gill
opening

the
usual
single
slit
adorned
with
a
gill
cover
an
order

genera

the
sturgeon
ah
conseil
my

you
saved
the
best
for

in
my
opinion
anyhow
and
thats
all

em
yes
my
gallant

and
note
well
even
when
one
has
grasped
all
this
one
still
knows
next
to
nothing
because
these
families
are
subdivided

genera
subgenera

my

conseil
exclaimed
one
would
think
he
was
in

an
aquarium
no
i
replied
because
an
aquarium
is
nothing
more
than
a
cage
and
these
fish
are
as
free
as
birds

although
the

he
was
no

i
doubt
that
he
could
tell
a
bonito

a
tuna
in
short
he
was
the
exact
opposite
of
the
canadian
who
knew
nothing
about
classification

could
instantly
put
a

any

glee

topside
a

pink
on

armed
with

woke
up
only
after
a
long
twelvehour
slumber

a
creature
of

came
to
ask
how
masters
night
went
and
to
offer
his

he
had
left
his
canadian

sleeping

babble
as
he
pleased
without
giving
him
much
in
the
way
of
a
reply
i
was
concerned
about
captain
nemos
absence
during
our
session
the
previous
afternoon
and
i
hoped
to
see
him
again
today
soon
i
had
put
on
my
clothes
which
were
woven
from
strands
of
seashell
tissue
more
than
once
their
composition
provoked
comments
from
conseil
i
informed
him
that
they
were
made
from
the
smooth
silken
filaments
with
which
the
fan
mussel
a
type
of
seashell
quite
abundant
along
mediterranean
beaches
attaches
itself
to
rocks
in
olden
times
fine
fabrics
stockings
and
gloves
were
made
from
such
filaments
because
they
were
both
very
soft
and
very
warm
so
the
nautiluss
crew
could
dress
themselves
at
little
cost
without
needing
a
thing
from
cotton
growers
sheep
or
silkworms
on
shore
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
i
made
my
way
to
the
main
lounge
it
was
deserted
i
dove
into
studying
the
conchological
treasures
amassed
inside
the
glass
cases
i
also
investigated
the
huge
plant
albums
that
were
filled
with
the
rarest
marine
herbs
which
although
they
were
pressed
and
dried
still
kept
their
wonderful
colors

these
valuable

the
entire

passed
without
my
being
honored
by
a

from

the

in
the

didnt
open
perhaps
they
didnt
want
us
to

as

noted
we
enjoyed
complete
freedom
we
were
daintily

abundantly
fed
our

had
kept
to
the

we
couldnt
complain

the

our
situation
had
such
generous
rewards
in
store
for
us
we
had
no
grounds
for
criticism
that
day
i
started
my
diary
of
these
adventures
which
has
enabled
me
to
narrate
them
with
the
most
scrupulous
accuracy
and
one
odd
detail
i
wrote
it
on
paper
manufactured
from
marine
eelgrass
early
in
the
morning
on
november
11
fresh
air
poured
through
the
nautiluss
interior
informing
me
that
we
had
returned
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
to
renew
our
oxygen
supply
i
headed
for
the
central
companionway
and
climbed
onto
the
platform
it
was
six
oclock
i
found
the
weather
overcast
the
sea
gray
but
calm
hardly
a
billow
i
hoped
to
encounter
captain
nemo
therewould
he
come
i
saw
only
the
helmsman
imprisoned
in
his
glasswindowed
pilothouse
seated
on
the
ledge
furnished
by
the
hull
of
the
skiff
i
inhaled
the
seas
salty
aroma
with
great
pleasure
little
by
little
the
mists
were
dispersed
under
the
action
of
the
suns
rays
the
radiant
orb
cleared
the
eastern
horizon
under
its
gaze
the
sea
caught
on
fire
like
a
trail
of
gunpowder
scattered
on
high
the
clouds
were
colored
in
bright
wonderfully
shaded
hues
and
numerous
ladyfingers
warned
of
daylong
winds
authors
note
ladyfingers
are
small
thin
white
clouds
with
ragged
edges
but
what
were
mere
winds
to
this
nautilus
which
no
storms
could
intimidate
so
i
was
marveling
at
this
delightful
sunrise
so
lifegiving
and
cheerful
when
i
heard
someone
climbing
onto
the
platform
i
was
prepared
to
greet
captain
nemo
but
it
was
his
chief
officer
who
appearedwhom
i
had
already
met
during
our
first
visit
with
the
captain
he
advanced
over
the
platform
not
seeming
to
notice
my
presence
a
powerful
spyglass
to
his
eye
he
scrutinized
every
point
of
the
horizon
with
the
utmost
care
then
his
examination
over
he
approached
the
hatch
and
pronounced
a
phrase
whose
exact
wording
follows
below
i
remember
it
because
every
morning
it
was
repeated
under
the
same
circumstances
it
ran
like
this
nautron
respoc
lorni
virch
what
it
meant
i
was
unable
to
say
these
words
pronounced
the
chief
officer
went
below
again
i
thought
the
nautilus
was
about
to
resume
its
underwater
navigating
so
i
went
down
the
hatch
and
back
through
the
gangways
to
my
stateroom
five
days
passed
in
this
way
with
no
change
in
our
situation
every
morning
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
the
same
phrase
was
pronounced
by
the
same
individual
captain
nemo
did
not
appear
i
was
pursuing
the
policy
that
we
had
seen
the
last
of
him
when
on
november
16
while
reentering
my
stateroom
with
ned
and
conseil
i
found
a
note
addressed
to
me
on
the
table
i
opened
it
impatiently
it
was
written
in
a
script
that
was
clear
and
neat
but
a
bit
old
english
in
style
its
characters
reminding
me
of
german
calligraphy
the
note
was
worded
as
follows
professor
aronnax
aboard
the
nautilus
november
16
1867
captain
nemo
invites
professor
aronnax
on
a
hunting
trip
that
will
take
place
tomorrow
morning
in
his
crespo
island
forests
he
hopes
nothing
will
prevent
the
professor
from
attending
and
he
looks
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
professors
companions
joining
him
captain
nemo
commander
of
the
nautilus
a
hunting
trip
ned
exclaimed
and
in
his
forests
on
crespo
island
conseil
added
but
does
this
mean
the
old
boy
goes
ashore
ned
land
went
on
that
seems
to
be
the
gist
of
it
i
said
rereading
the
letter
well
weve
got
to
accept
the
canadian
answered
once
were
on
solid
ground
well
figure
out
a
course
of
action
besides
it
wouldnt
pain
me
to
eat
a
couple
slices
of
fresh
venison
without
trying
to
reconcile
the
contradictions
between
captain
nemos
professed
horror
of
continents
or
islands
and
his
invitation
to
go
hunting
in
a
forest
i
was
content
to
reply
first
lets
look
into
this
crespo
island
i
consulted
the
world
map
and
in
latitude
32
degrees
40
north
and
longitude
167
degrees
50
west
i
found
an
islet
that
had
been
discovered
in
1801
by
captain
crespo
which
old
spanish
charts
called
rocca
de
la
plata
in
other
words
silver
rock
so
we
were
about
1800
miles
from
our
starting
point
and
by
a
slight
change
of
heading
the
nautilus
was
bringing
us
back
toward
the
southeast
i
showed
my
companions
this
small
stray
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
north
pacific
if
captain
nemo
does
sometimes
go
ashore
i
told
them
at
least
he
only
picks
desert
islands
ned
land
shook
his
head
without
replying
then
he
and
conseil
left
me
after
supper
was
served
me
by
the
mute
and
emotionless
steward
i
fell
asleep
but
not
without
some
anxieties
when
i
woke
up
the
next
day
november
17
i
sensed
that
the
nautilus
was
completely
motionless
i
dressed
hurriedly
and
entered
the
main
lounge
captain
nemo
was
there
waiting
for
me
he
stood
up
bowed
and
asked
if
it
suited
me
to
come
along
since
he
made
no
allusion
to
his
absence
the
past
eight
days
i
also
refrained
from
mentioning
it
and
i
simply
answered
that
my
companions
and
i
were
ready
to
go
with
him
only
sir
i
added
ill
take
the
liberty
of
addressing
a
question
to
you
address
away
professor
aronnax
and
if
im
able
to
answer
i
will
well
then
captain
how
is
it
that
youve
severed
all
ties
with
the
shore
yet
you
own
forests
on
crespo
island
professor
the
captain
answered
me
these
forests
of
mine
dont
bask
in
the
heat
and
light
of
the
sun
they
arent
frequented
by
lions
tigers
panthers
or
other
quadrupeds
theyre
known
only
to
me
they
grow
only
for
me
these
forests
arent
on
land
theyre
actual
underwater
forests
underwater
forests
i
exclaimed
yes
professor
and
youre
offering
to
take
me
to
them
precisely
on
foot
without
getting
your
feet
wet
while
hunting
while
hunting
rifles
in
hand
rifles
in
hand
i
stared
at
the
nautiluss
commander
with
an
air
anything
but
flattering
to
the
man
assuredly
i
said
to
myself
hes
contracted
some
mental
illness
hes
had
a
fit
thats
lasted
eight
days
and
isnt
over
even
yet
what
a
shame
i
liked
him
better
eccentric
than
insane
these
thoughts
were
clearly
readable
on
my
face
but
captain
nemo
remained
content
with
inviting
me
to
follow
him
and
i
did
so
like
a
man
resigned
to
the
worst
we
arrived
at
the
dining
room
where
we
found
breakfast
served
professor
aronnax
the
captain
told
me
i
beg
you
to
share
my
breakfast
without
formality
we
can
chat
while
we
eat
because
although
i
promised
you
a
stroll
in
my
forests
i
made
no
pledge
to
arrange
for
your
encountering
a
restaurant
there
accordingly
eat
your
breakfast
like
a
man
wholl
probably
eat
dinner
only
when
its
extremely
late
i
did
justice
to
this
meal
it
was
made
up
of
various
fish
and
some
slices
of
sea
cucumber
that
praiseworthy
zoophyte
all
garnished
with
such
highly
appetizing
seaweed
as
the
porphyra
laciniata
and
the
laurencia
primafetida
our
beverage
consisted
of
clear
water
to
which
following
the
captains
example
i
added
some
drops
of
a
fermented
liquor
extracted
by
the
kamchatka
process
from
the
seaweed
known
by
name
as
rhodymenia
palmata
at
first
captain
nemo
ate
without
pronouncing
a
single
word
then
he
told
me
professor
when
i
proposed
that
you
go
hunting
in
my
crespo
forests
you
thought
i
was
contradicting
myself
when
i
informed
you
that
it
was
an
issue
of
underwater
forests
you
thought
id
gone
insane
professor
you
must
never
make
snap
judgments
about
your
fellow
man
but
captain
believe
me
kindly
listen
to
me
and
youll
see
if
you
have
grounds
for
accusing
me
of
insanity
or
selfcontradiction
im
all
attention
professor
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
a
man
can
live
underwater
so
long
as
he
carries
with
him
his
own
supply
of
breathable
air
for
underwater
work
projects
the
workman
wears
a
waterproof
suit
with
his
head
imprisoned
in
a
metal
capsule
while
he
receives
air
from
above
by
means
of
force
pumps
and
flow
regulators
thats
the
standard
equipment
for
a
diving
suit
i
said
correct
but
under
such
conditions
the
man
has
no
freedom
hes
attached
to
a
pump
that
sends
him
air
through
an
indiarubber
hose
its
an
actual
chain
that
fetters
him
to
the
shore
and
if
we
were
to
be
bound
in
this
way
to
the
nautilus
we
couldnt
go
far
either
then
how
do
you
break
free
i
asked
we
use
the
rouquayroldenayrouze
device
invented
by
two
of
your
fellow
countrymen
but
refined
by
me
for
my
own
special
uses
thereby
enabling
you
to
risk
these
new
physiological
conditions
without
suffering
any
organic
disorders
it
consists
of
a
tank
built
from
heavy
sheet
iron
in
which
i
store
air
under
a
pressure
of
fifty
atmospheres
this
tank
is
fastened
to
the
back
by
means
of
straps
like
a
soldiers
knapsack
its
top
part
forms
a
box
where
the
air
is
regulated
by
a
bellows
mechanism
and
can
be
released
only
at
its
proper
tension
in
the
rouquayrol
device
that
has
been
in
general
use
two
indiarubber
hoses
leave
this
box
and
feed
to
a
kind
of
tent
that
imprisons
the
operators
nose
and
mouth
one
hose
is
for
the
entrance
of
air
to
be
inhaled
the
other
for
the
exit
of
air
to
be
exhaled
and
the
tongue
closes
off
the
former
or
the
latter
depending
on
the
breathers
needs
but
in
my
case
since
i
face
considerable
pressures
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
i
needed
to
enclose
my
head
in
a
copper
sphere
like
those
found
on
standard
diving
suits
and
the
two
hoses
for
inhalation
and
exhalation
now
feed
to
that
sphere
thats
perfect
captain
nemo
but
the
air
you
carry
must
be
quickly
depleted
and
once
it
contains
no
more
than
15
oxygen
it
becomes
unfit
for
breathing
surely
but
as
i
told
you
professor
aronnax
the
nautiluss
pumps
enable
me
to
store
air
under
considerable
pressure
and
given
this
circumstance
the
tank
on
my
diving
equipment
can
supply
breathable
air
for
nine
or
ten
hours
ive
no
more
objections
to
raise
i
replied
ill
only
ask
you
captain
how
can
you
light
your
way
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
with
the
ruhmkorff
device
professor
aronnax
if
the
first
is
carried
on
the
back
the
second
is
fastened
to
the
belt
it
consists
of
a
bunsen
battery
that
i
activate
not
with
potassium
dichromate
but
with
sodium
an
induction
coil
gathers
the
electricity
generated
and
directs
it
to
a
specially
designed
lantern
in
this
lantern
one
finds
a
glass
spiral
that
contains
only
a
residue
of
carbon
dioxide
gas
when
the
device
is
operating
this
gas
becomes
luminous
and
gives
off
a
continuous
whitish
light
thus
provided
for
i
breathe
and
i
see
captain
nemo
to
my
every
objection
you
give
such
crushing
answers
im
afraid
to
entertain
a
single
doubt
however
though
i
have
no
choice
but
to
accept
both
the
rouquayrol
and
ruhmkorff
devices
id
like
to
register
some
reservations
about
the
rifle
with
which
youll
equip
me
but
it
isnt
a
rifle
that
uses
gunpowder
the
captain
replied
then
its
an
air
gun
surely
how
can
i
make
gunpowder
on
my
ship
when
i
have
no
saltpeter
sulfur
or
charcoal
even
so
i
replied
to
fire
underwater
in
a
medium
thats
855
times
denser
than
air
youd
have
to
overcome
considerable
resistance
that
doesnt
necessarily
follow
there
are
certain
fultonstyle
guns
perfected
by
the
englishmen
philippecoles
and
burley
the
frenchman
furcy
and
the
italian
landi
theyre
equipped
with
a
special
system
of
airtight
fastenings
and
can
fire
in
underwater
conditions
but
i
repeat
having
no
gunpowder
ive
replaced
it
with
air
at
high
pressure
which
is
abundantly
supplied
me
by
the
nautiluss
pumps
but
this
air
must
be
swiftly
depleted
well
in
a
pinch
cant
my
rouquayrol
tank
supply
me
with
more
all
i
have
to
do
is
draw
it
from
an
ad
hoc
spigot
besides
professor
aronnax
youll
see
for
yourself
that
during
these
underwater
hunting
trips
we
make
no
great
expenditure
of
either
air
or
bullets
latin
a
spigot
just
for
that
purpose
ed
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
semidarkness
amid
this
liquid
thats
so
dense
in
comparison
to
the
atmosphere
a
gunshot
couldnt
carry
far
and
would
prove
fatal
only
with
difficulty
on
the
contrary
sir
with
this
rifle
every
shot
is
fatal
and
as
soon
as
the
animal
is
hit
no
matter
how
lightly
it
falls
as
if
struck
by
lightning
why
because
this
rifle
doesnt
shoot
ordinary
bullets
but
little
glass
capsules
invented
by
the
austrian
chemist
leniebroek
and
i
have
a
considerable
supply
of
them
these
glass
capsules
are
covered
with
a
strip
of
steel
and
weighted
with
a
lead
base
theyre
genuine
little
leyden
jars
charged
with
highvoltage
electricity
they
go
off
at
the
slightest
impact
and
the
animal
no
matter
how
strong
drops
dead
i
might
add
that
these
capsules
are
no
bigger
than
number
4
shot
and
the
chamber
of
any
ordinary
rifle
could
hold
ten
of
them
ill
quit
debating
i
replied
getting
up
from
the
table
and
all
thats
left
is
for
me
to
shoulder
my
rifle
so
where
you
go
ill
go
captain
nemo
led
me
to
the
nautiluss
stern
and
passing
by
ned
and
conseils
cabin
i
summoned
my
two
companions
who
instantly
followed
us
then
we
arrived
at
a
cell
located
within
easy
access
of
the
engine
room
in
this
cell
we
were
to
get
dressed
for
our
stroll
chapter
16
strolling
the
plains
this
cell
properly
speaking
was
the
nautiluss
arsenal
and
wardrobe
hanging
from
its
walls
a
dozen
diving
outfits
were
waiting
for
anybody
who
wanted
to
take
a
stroll
after
seeing
these
ned
land
exhibited
an
obvious
distaste
for
the
idea
of
putting
one
on
but
my
gallant
ned
i
told
him
the
forests
of
crespo
island
are
simply
underwater
forests
oh
great
put
in
the
disappointed
harpooner
watching
his
dreams
of
fresh
meat
fade
away
and
you
professor
aronnax
are
you
going
to
stick
yourself
inside
these
clothes
it
has
to
be
mr
ned
have
it
your
way
sir
the
harpooner
replied
shrugging
his
shoulders
but
speaking
for
myself
ill
never
get
into
those
things
unless
they
force
me
no
one
will
force
you
mr
land
captain
nemo
said
and
is
conseil
going
to
risk
it
ned
asked
where
master
goes
i
go
conseil
replied
at
the
captains
summons
two
crewmen
came
to
help
us
put
on
these
heavy
waterproof
clothes
made
from
seamless
india
rubber
and
expressly
designed
to
bear
considerable
pressures
they
were
like
suits
of
armor
that
were
both
yielding
and
resistant
you
might
say
these
clothes
consisted
of
jacket
and
pants
the
pants
ended
in
bulky
footwear
adorned
with
heavy
lead
soles
the
fabric
of
the
jacket
was
reinforced
with
copper
mail
that
shielded
the
chest
protected
it
from
the
waters
pressure
and
allowed
the
lungs
to
function
freely
the
sleeves
ended
in
supple
gloves
that
didnt
impede
hand
movements
these
perfected
diving
suits
it
was
easy
to
see
were
a
far
cry
from
such
misshapen
costumes
as
the
cork
breastplates
leather
jumpers
seagoing
tunics
barrel
helmets
etc
invented
and
acclaimed
in
the
18th
century
conseil
and
i
were
soon
dressed
in
these
diving
suits
as
were
captain
nemo
and
one
of
his
companionsa
herculean
type
who
must
have
been
prodigiously
strong
all
that
remained
was
to
encase
ones
head
in
its
metal
sphere
but
before
proceeding
with
this
operation
i
asked
the
captain
for
permission
to
examine
the
rifles
set
aside
for
us
one
of
the
nautiluss
men
presented
me
with
a
streamlined
rifle
whose
butt
was
boilerplate
steel
hollow
inside
and
of
fairly
large
dimensions
this
served
as
a
tank
for
the
compressed
air
which
a
triggeroperated
valve
could
release
into
the
metal
chamber
in
a
groove
where
the
butt
was
heaviest
a
cartridge
clip
held
some
twenty
electric
bullets
that
by
means
of
a
spring
automatically
took
their
places
in
the
barrel
of
the
rifle
as
soon
as
one
shot
had
been
fired
another
was
ready
to
go
off
captain
nemo
i
said
this
is
an
ideal
easytouse
weapon
i
ask
only
to
put
it
to
the
test
but
how
will
we
reach
the
bottom
of
the
sea
right
now
professor
the
nautilus
is
aground
in
ten
meters
of
water
and
weve
only
to
depart
but
how
will
we
set
out
youll
see
captain
nemo
inserted
his
cranium
into
its
spherical
headgear
conseil
and
i
did
the
same
but
not
without
hearing
the
canadian
toss
us
a
sarcastic
happy
hunting
on
top
the
suit
ended
in
a
collar
of
threaded
copper
onto
which
the
metal
helmet
was
screwed
three
holes
protected
by
heavy
glass
allowed
us
to
see
in
any
direction
with
simply
a
turn
of
the
head
inside
the
sphere
placed
on
our
backs
the
rouquayrol
device
went
into
operation
as
soon
as
it
was
in
position
and
for
my
part
i
could
breathe
with
ease
the
ruhmkorff
lamp
hanging
from
my
belt
my
rifle
in
hand
i
was
ready
to
go
forth
but
in
all
honesty
while
imprisoned
in
these
heavy
clothes
and
nailed
to
the
deck
by
my
lead
soles
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
take
a
single
step
but
this
circumstance
had
been
foreseen
because
i
felt
myself
propelled
into
a
little
room
adjoining
the
wardrobe
towed
in
the
same
way
my
companions
went
with
me
i
heard
a
door
with
watertight
seals
close
after
us
and
we
were
surrounded
by
profound
darkness
after
some
minutes
a
sharp
hissing
reached
my
ears
i
felt
a
distinct
sensation
of
cold
rising
from
my
feet
to
my
chest
apparently
a
stopcock
inside
the
boat
was
letting
in
water
from
outside
which
overran
us
and
soon
filled
up
the
room
contrived
in
the
nautiluss
side
a
second
door
then
opened
we
were
lit
by
a
subdued
light
an
instant
later
our
feet
were
treading
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
now
how
can
i
convey
the
impressions
left
on
me
by
this
stroll
under
the
waters
words
are
powerless
to
describe
such
wonders
when
even
the
painters
brush
cant
depict
the
effects
unique
to
the
liquid
element
how
can
the
writers
pen
hope
to
reproduce
them
captain
nemo
walked
in
front
and
his
companion
followed
us
a
few
steps
to
the
rear
conseil
and
i
stayed
next
to
each
other
as
if
daydreaming
that
through
our
metal
carapaces
a
little
polite
conversation
might
still
be
possible
already
i
no
longer
felt
the
bulkiness
of
my
clothes
footwear
and
air
tank
nor
the
weight
of
the
heavy
sphere
inside
which
my
head
was
rattling
like
an
almond
in
its
shell
once
immersed
in
water
all
these
objects
lost
a
part
of
their
weight
equal
to
the
weight
of
the
liquid
they
displaced
and
thanks
to
this
law
of
physics
discovered
by
archimedes
i
did
just
fine
i
was
no
longer
an
inert
mass
and
i
had
comparatively
speaking
great
freedom
of
movement
lighting
up
the
seafloor
even
thirty
feet
beneath
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
sun
astonished
me
with
its
power
the
solar
rays
easily
crossed
this
aqueous
mass
and
dispersed
its
dark
colors
i
could
easily
distinguish
objects
100
meters
away
farther
on
the
bottom
was
tinted
with
fine
shades
of
ultramarine
then
off
in
the
distance
it
turned
blue
and
faded
in
the
midst
of
a
hazy
darkness
truly
this
water
surrounding
me
was
just
a
kind
of
air
denser
than
the
atmosphere
on
land
but
almost
as
transparent
above
me
i
could
see
the
calm
surface
of
the
ocean
we
were
walking
on
sand
that
was
finegrained
and
smooth
not
wrinkled
like
beach
sand
which
preserves
the
impressions
left
by
the
waves
this
dazzling
carpet
was
a
real
mirror
throwing
back
the
suns
rays
with
startling
intensity
the
outcome
an
immense
vista
of
reflections
that
penetrated
every
liquid
molecule
will
anyone
believe
me
if
i
assert
that
at
this
thirtyfoot
depth
i
could
see
as
if
it
was
broad
daylight
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
trod
this
blazing
sand
which
was
strewn
with
tiny
crumbs
of
seashell
looming
like
a
long
reef
the
nautiluss
hull
disappeared
little
by
little
but
when
night
fell
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
the
ships
beacon
would
surely
facilitate
our
return
on
board
since
its
rays
carried
with
perfect
distinctness
this
effect
is
difficult
to
understand
for
anyone
who
has
never
seen
light
beams
so
sharply
defined
on
shore
there
the
dust
that
saturates
the
air
gives
such
rays
the
appearance
of
a
luminous
fog
but
above
water
as
well
as
underwater
shafts
of
electric
light
are
transmitted
with
incomparable
clarity
meanwhile
we
went
ever
onward
and
these
vast
plains
of
sand
seemed
endless
my
hands
parted
liquid
curtains
that
closed
again
behind
me
and
my
footprints
faded
swiftly
under
the
waters
pressure
soon
scarcely
blurred
by
their
distance
from
us
the
forms
of
some
objects
took
shape
before
my
eyes
i
recognized
the
lower
slopes
of
some
magnificent
rocks
carpeted
by
the
finest
zoophyte
specimens
and
right
off
i
was
struck
by
an
effect
unique
to
this
medium
by
then
it
was
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
the
suns
rays
hit
the
surface
of
the
waves
at
a
fairly
oblique
angle
decomposing
by
refraction
as
though
passing
through
a
prism
and
when
this
light
came
in
contact
with
flowers
rocks
buds
seashells
and
polyps
the
edges
of
these
objects
were
shaded
with
all
seven
hues
of
the
solar
spectrum
this
riot
of
rainbow
tints
was
a
wonder
a
feast
for
the
eyes
a
genuine
kaleidoscope
of
red
green
yellow
orange
violet
indigo
and
blue
in
short
the
whole
palette
of
a
colorhappy
painter
if
only
i
had
been
able
to
share
with
conseil
the
intense
sensations
rising
in
my
brain
competing
with
him
in
exclamations
of
wonderment
if
only
i
had
known
like
captain
nemo
and
his
companion
how
to
exchange
thoughts
by
means
of
prearranged
signals
so
for
lack
of
anything
better
i
talked
to
myself
i
declaimed
inside
this
copper
box
that
topped
my
head
spending
more
air
on
empty
words
than
was
perhaps
advisable
conseil
like
me
had
stopped
before
this
splendid
sight
obviously
in
the
presence
of
these
zoophyte
and
mollusk
specimens
the
fine
lad
was
classifying
his
head
off
polyps
and
echinoderms
abounded
on
the

holding
on
by
their

providing
a
literal
flowerbed
adorned
by
jellyfish
from
the
genus
porpita
wearing
collars
of
azure
tentacles
and
starfish
that
spangled
the
sand
including
veinlike
feather
stars
from
the
genus
asterophyton
that
were
like
fine
lace
embroidered
by
the
hands
of
water
nymphs
their
festoons
swaying
to
the
faint
undulations
caused
by
our
walking
it
filled
me
with
real
chagrin
to
crush
underfoot
the
gleaming
mollusk

that
littered
the
seafloor
by
the
thousands

and
so
many
other
exhibits
from
this
inexhaustible
ocean
but
we
had
to
keep
walking
and
we
went
forward
while
overhead
there
scudded
schools
of
portuguese
menofwar
that
let
their
ultramarine
tentacles
drift
in
their
wakes
medusas
whose
milky
white
or
dainty
pink
parasols
were
festooned
with
azure
tassels
and
shaded
us
from
the
suns
rays
plus
jellyfish
of
the
species
pelagia
panopyra
that
in
the
dark
would
have
strewn
our
path
with
phosphorescent
glimmers
all
these
wonders
i
glimpsed
in
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
barely
pausing
following
captain
nemo
whose
gestures
kept
beckoning
me
onward
soon
the
nature
of
the
seafloor
changed
the
plains
of
sand
were
followed
by
a
bed
of
that
viscous
slime
americans
call
ooze
which
is
composed
exclusively
of
seashells
rich
in
limestone
or
silica
then
we
crossed
a
prairie
of
algae

whose

in
wild
profusion
soft
to
the

these

textured

would
have
rivaled
the

of

but
while
this
greenery
was
sprawling
under
our
steps
it
didnt
neglect
us
overhead
the
surface
of
the
water
was
crisscrossed
by
a
floating
arbor
of
marine
plants
belonging
to
that
superabundant
algae
family
that
numbers
more
than
2000

i
saw
long
ribbons
of
fucus
drifting
above
me
some
globular

tubular
laurencia
cladostephus
with
the
slenderest
foliage
rhodymenia

resembling
the

i
observed
that
greencolored
plants
kept
closer
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
while
reds
occupied
a
medium
depth
which
left
blacks
and
browns
in
charge
of
designing

and

in

these
algae
are
a
genuine
prodigy
of
creation
one
of
the
wonders
of

flora
this
family
produces
both
the
biggest
and
smallest
vegetables
in
the
world
because
just
as
40000
nearinvisible

have
been
counted
in
one
fivesquaremillimeter
space
so
also
have
fucus
plants
been
gathered
that
were
over
500
meters
long
we
had
been
gone
from
the
nautilus
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
it
was
almost
noon
i
spotted
this
fact
in
the
perpendicularity
of
the
suns
rays
which
were
no
longer
refracted
the
magic
of
these
solar
colors
disappeared
little
by
little
with
emerald
and
sapphire
shades
vanishing
from
our
surroundings
altogether
we
walked
with
steady
steps
that
rang
on
the
seafloor
with
astonishing
intensity
the
tiniest
sounds
were
transmitted
with
a
speed
to
which
the
ear
is
unaccustomed
on
shore
in
fact
water
is
a
better
conductor
of
sound
than
air
and
under
the
waves
noises
carry
four
times
as
fast
just
then
the
seafloor
began
to
slope
sharply
downward
the
light
took
on
a
uniform
hue
we
reached
a
depth
of
100
meters
by
which
point
we
were
undergoing
a
pressure
of
ten
atmospheres
but
my
diving
clothes
were
built
along
such
lines
that
i
never
suffered
from
this
pressure
i
felt
only
a
certain
tightness
in
the
joints
of
my
fingers
and
even
this
discomfort
soon
disappeared
as
for
the
exhaustion
bound
to
accompany
a
twohour
stroll
in
such
unfamiliar
trappingsit
was
nil
helped
by
the
water
my
movements
were
executed
with
startling
ease
arriving
at
this
300foot
depth
i
still
detected
the
suns
rays
but
just
barely
their
intense
brilliance
had
been
followed
by
a
reddish
twilight
a
midpoint
between
day
and
night
but
we
could
see
well
enough
to
find
our
way
and
it
still
wasnt
necessary
to
activate
the
ruhmkorff
device
just
then
captain
nemo
stopped
he
waited
until
i
joined
him
then
he
pointed
a
finger
at
some
dark
masses
outlined
in
the
shadows
a
short
distance
away
its
the
forest
of
crespo

thought
and
i
was
not
mistaken
chapter
17
an
underwater
forest
we
had
finally
arrived
on
the
outskirts
of
this
forest
surely
one
of
the
finest
in
captain
nemos
immense
domains
he
regarded
it
as
his
own
and
had
laid
the
same
claim
to
it
that
in
the
first
days
of
the
world
the
first
men
had
to
their
forests
on
land
besides
who
else
could
dispute
his
ownership
of
this
underwater
property
what
other
bolder
pioneer
would
come
ax
in
hand
to
clear
away
its
dark
underbrush
this
forest
was
made
up
of
big
treelike
plants
and
when
we
entered
beneath
their
huge
arches
my
eyes
were
instantly
struck
by
the
unique
arrangement
of
their
branchesan
arrangement
that
i
had
never
before
encountered
none
of
the
weeds
carpeting
the
seafloor
none
of
the
branches
bristling
from
the
shrubbery
crept
or
leaned
or
stretched
on
a
horizontal
plane
they
all
rose
right
up
toward
the
surface
of
the
ocean
every
filament
or
ribbon
no
matter
how
thin
stood
ramrod
straight
fucus
plants
and
creepers
were
growing
in
stiff
perpendicular
lines
governed
by
the
density
of
the
element
that
generated
them
after
i
parted
them
with
my
hands
these
otherwise
motionless
plants
would
shoot
right
back
to
their
original
positions
it
was
the
regime
of
verticality
i
soon
grew
accustomed
to
this
bizarre
arrangement
likewise
to
the
comparative
darkness
surrounding
us
the
seafloor
in
this
forest
was
strewn
with
sharp
chunks
of
stone
that
were
hard
to
avoid
here
the
range
of
underwater
flora
seemed
pretty
comprehensive
to
me
as
well
as
more
abundant
than
it
might
have
been
in
the
arctic
or
tropical
zones
where
such
exhibits
are
less
common
but
for
a
few
minutes
i
kept
accidentally
confusing
the
two
kingdoms
mistaking
zoophytes
for
water
plants
animals
for
vegetables
and
who
hasnt
made
the
same
blunder
flora
and
fauna
are
so
closely
associated
in
the
underwater
world
i
observed
that
all
these
exhibits
from
the
vegetable
kingdom
were
attached
to
the
seafloor
by
only
the
most
makeshift
methods
they
had
no
roots
and
didnt
care
which
solid
objects
secured
them
sand
shells
husks
or
pebbles
they
didnt
ask
their
hosts
for
sustenance
just
a
point
of
purchase
these
plants
are
entirely
selfpropagating
and
the
principle
of
their
existence
lies
in
the
water
that
sustains
and
nourishes
them
in
place
of
leaves
most
of
them
sprouted
blades
of
unpredictable
shape
which
were
confined
to
a
narrow
gamut
of
colors
consisting
only
of
pink
crimson
green
olive
tan
and
brown
there
i
saw
again
but
not
yet
pressed
and
dried
like
the
nautiluss
specimens
some
peacocks
tails
spread
open
like
fans
to
stir
up
a
cooling
breeze
scarlet
rosetangle
sea
tangle
stretching
out
their
young
and
edible
shoots
twisting
strings
of
kelp
from
the
genus
nereocystis
that
bloomed
to
a
height
of
fifteen
meters
bouquets
of
mermaids
cups
whose
stems
grew
wider
at
the
top
and
a
number
of
other
opensea
plants
all
without
flowers
its
an
odd
anomaly
in
this
bizarre
element
as
one
witty
naturalist
puts
it
the
animal
kingdom
blossoms
and
the
vegetable
kingdom
doesnt
these
various
types
of
shrubbery
were
as
big
as
trees
in
the
temperate
zones
in
the
damp
shade
between
them
there
were
clustered
actual
bushes
of
moving
flowers
hedges
of
zoophytes
in
which
there
grew
stony
coral
striped
with
twisting
furrows
yellowish
sea
anemone
from
the
genus
caryophylia
with
translucent
tentacles
plus
anemone
with
grassy
tufts
from
the
genus
zoantharia
and
to
complete
the
illusion
minnows
flitted
from
branch
to
branch
like
a
swarm
of
hummingbirds
while
there
rose
underfoot
like
a
covey
of
snipe
yellow
fish
from
the
genus
lepisocanthus
with
bristling
jaws
and
sharp
scales
flying
gurnards
and
pinecone
fish
near
one
oclock
captain
nemo
gave
the
signal
to
halt
speaking
for
myself
i
was
glad
to
oblige
and
we
stretched
out
beneath
an
arbor
of
winged
kelp
whose
long
thin
tendrils
stood
up
like
arrows
this
short
break
was
a
delight
it
lacked
only
the
charm
of
conversation
but
it
was
impossible
to
speak
impossible
to
reply
i
simply
nudged
my
big
copper
headpiece
against
conseils
headpiece
i
saw
a
happy
gleam
in
the
gallant
lads
eyes
and
to
communicate
his
pleasure
he
jiggled
around
inside
his
carapace
in
the
worlds
silliest
way
after
four
hours
of
strolling
i
was
quite
astonished
not
to
feel
any
intense
hunger
what
kept
my
stomach
in
such
a
good
mood
im
unable
to
say
but
in
exchange
i
experienced
that
irresistible
desire
for
sleep
that
comes
over
every
diver
accordingly
my
eyes
soon
closed
behind
their
heavy
glass
windows
and
i
fell
into
an
uncontrollable
doze
which
until
then
i
had
been
able
to
fight
off
only
through
the
movements
of
our
walking
captain
nemo
and
his
muscular
companion
were
already
stretched
out
in
this
clear
crystal
setting
us
a
fine
naptime
example
how
long
i
was
sunk
in
this
torpor
i
cannot
estimate
but
when
i
awoke
it
seemed
as
if
the
sun
were
settling
toward
the
horizon
captain
nemo
was
already
up
and
i
had
started
to
stretch
my
limbs
when
an
unexpected
apparition
brought
me
sharply
to
my
feet
a
few
paces
away
a
monstrous
meterhigh
sea
spider
was
staring
at
me
with
beady
eyes
poised
to
spring
at
me
although
my
diving
suit
was
heavy
enough
to
protect
me
from
this
animals
bites
i
couldnt
keep
back
a
shudder
of
horror
just
then
conseil
woke
up
together
with
the
nautiluss
sailor
captain
nemo
alerted
his
companion
to
this
hideous
crustacean
which
a
swing
of
the
rifle
butt
quickly
brought
down
and
i
watched
the
monsters
horrible
legs
writhing
in
dreadful
convulsions
this
encounter
reminded
me
that
other
more
daunting
animals
must
be
lurking
in
these
dark
reaches
and
my
diving
suit
might
not
be
adequate
protection
against
their
attacks
such
thoughts
hadnt
previously
crossed
my
mind
and
i
was
determined
to
keep
on
my
guard
meanwhile
i
had
assumed
this
rest
period
would
be
the
turning
point
in
our
stroll
but
i
was
mistaken
and
instead
of
heading
back
to
the
nautilus
captain
nemo
continued
his
daring
excursion
the
seafloor
kept
sinking
and
its
significantly
steeper
slope
took
us
to
greater
depths
it
must
have
been
nearly
three
oclock
when
we
reached
a
narrow
valley
gouged
between
high
vertical
walls
and
located
150
meters
down
thanks
to
the
perfection
of
our
equipment
we
had
thus
gone
ninety
meters
below
the
limit
that
nature
had
until
then
set
on
mans
underwater
excursions
i
say
150
meters
although
i
had
no
instruments
for
estimating
this
distance
but
i
knew
that
the
suns
rays
even
in
the
clearest
seas
could
reach
no
deeper
so
at
precisely
this
point
the
darkness
became
profound
not
a
single
object
was
visible
past
ten
paces
consequently
i
had
begun
to
grope
my
way
when
suddenly
i
saw
the
glow
of
an
intense
white
light
captain
nemo
had
just
activated
his
electric
device
his
companion
did
likewise
conseil
and
i
followed
suit
by
turning
a
switch
i
established
contact
between
the
induction
coil
and
the
glass
spiral
and
the
sea
lit
up
by
our
four
lanterns
was
illuminated
for
a
radius
of
twentyfive
meters
captain
nemo
continued
to
plummet
into
the
dark
depths
of
this
forest
whose
shrubbery
grew
ever
more
sparse
i
observed
that
vegetable
life
was
disappearing
more
quickly
than
animal
life
the
opensea
plants
had
already
left
behind
the
increasingly
arid
seafloor
where
a
prodigious
number
of
animals
were
still
swarming
zoophytes
articulates
mollusks
and
fish
while
we
were
walking
i
thought
the
lights
of
our
ruhmkorff
devices
would
automatically
attract
some
inhabitants
of
these
dark
strata
but
if
they
did
approach
us
at
least
they
kept
at
a
distance
regrettable
from
the
hunters
standpoint
several
times
i
saw
captain
nemo
stop
and
take
aim
with
his
rifle
then
after
sighting
down
its
barrel
for
a
few
seconds
he
would
straighten
up
and
resume
his
walk
finally
at
around
four
oclock
this
marvelous
excursion
came
to
an
end
a
wall
of
superb
rocks
stood
before
us
imposing
in
its
sheer
mass
a
pile
of
gigantic
stone
blocks
an
enormous
granite
cliffside
pitted
with
dark
caves
but
not
offering
a
single
gradient
we
could
climb
up
this
was
the
underpinning
of
crespo
island
this
was
land
the
captain
stopped
suddenly
a
gesture
from
him
brought
us
to
a
halt
and
however
much
i
wanted
to
clear
this
wall
i
had
to
stop
here
ended
the
domains
of
captain
nemo
he
had
no
desire
to
pass
beyond
them
farther
on
lay
a
part
of
the
globe
he
would
no
longer
tread
underfoot
our
return
journey
began
captain
nemo
resumed
the
lead
in
our
little
band
always
heading
forward
without
hesitation
i
noted
that
we
didnt
follow
the
same
path
in
returning
to
the
nautilus
this
new
route
very
steep
and
hence
very
arduous
quickly
took
us
close
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
but
this
return
to
the
upper
strata
wasnt
so
sudden
that
decompression
took
place
too
quickly
which
could
have
led
to
serious
organic
disorders
and
given
us
those
internal
injuries
so
fatal
to
divers
with
great
promptness
the
light
reappeared
and
grew
stronger
and
the
refraction
of
the
sun
already
low
on
the
horizon
again
ringed
the
edges
of
various
objects
with
the
entire
color
spectrum
at
a
depth
of
ten
meters
we
walked
amid
a
swarm
of
small
fish
from
every
species
more
numerous
than
birds
in
the
air
more
agile
too
but
no
aquatic
game
worthy
of
a
gunshot
had
yet
been
offered
to
our
eyes
just
then
i
saw
the
captains
weapon
spring
to
his
shoulder
and
track
a
moving
object
through
the
bushes
a
shot
went
off
i
heard
a
faint
hissing
and
an
animal
dropped
a
few
paces
away
literally
struck
by
lightning
it
was
a
magnificent
sea
otter
from
the
genus
enhydra
the
only
exclusively
marine
quadruped
one
and
a
half
meters
long
this
otter
had
to
be
worth
a
good
high
price
its
coat
chestnut
brown
above
and
silver
below
would
have
made
one
of
those
wonderful
fur
pieces
so
much
in
demand
in
the
russian
and
chinese
markets
the
fineness
and
luster
of
its
pelt
guaranteed
that
it
would
go
for
at
least
2000
francs
i
was
full
of
wonderment
at
this
unusual
mammal
with
its
circular
head
adorned
by
short
ears
its
round
eyes
its
white
whiskers
like
those
on
a
cat
its
webbed
and
clawed
feet
its
bushy
tail
hunted
and
trapped
by
fishermen
this
valuable
carnivore
has
become
extremely
rare
and
it
takes
refuge
chiefly
in
the
northernmost
parts
of
the
pacific
where
in
all
likelihood
its
species
will
soon
be
facing
extinction
captain
nemos
companion
picked
up
the
animal
loaded
it
on
his
shoulder
and
we
took
to
the
trail
again
for
an
hour
plains
of
sand
unrolled
before
our
steps
often
the
seafloor
rose
to
within
two
meters
of
the
surface
of
the
water
i
could
then
see
our
images
clearly
mirrored
on
the
underside
of
the
waves
but
reflected
upside
down
above
us
there
appeared
an
identical
band
that
duplicated
our
every
movement
and
gesture
in
short
a
perfect
likeness
of
the
quartet
near
which
it
walked
but
with
heads
down
and
feet
in
the
air
another
unusual
effect
heavy
clouds
passed
above
us
forming
and
fading
swiftly
but
after
thinking
it
over
i
realized
that
these
socalled
clouds
were
caused
simply
by
the
changing
densities
of
the
long
ground
swells
and
i
even
spotted
the
foaming
white
caps
that
their
breaking
crests
were
proliferating
over
the
surface
of
the
water
lastly
i
couldnt
help
seeing
the
actual
shadows
of
large
birds
passing
over
our
heads
swiftly
skimming
the
surface
of
the
sea
on
this
occasion
i
witnessed
one
of
the
finest
gunshots
ever
to
thrill
the
marrow
of
a
hunter
a
large
bird
with
a
wide
wingspan
quite
clearly
visible
approached
and
hovered
over
us
when
it
was
just
a
few
meters
above
the
waves
captain
nemos
companion
took
aim
and
fired
the
animal
dropped
electrocuted
and
its
descent
brought
it
within
reach
of
our
adroit
hunter
who
promptly
took
possession
of
it
it
was
an
albatross
of
the
finest
species
a
wonderful
specimen
of
these
opensea
fowl
this
incident
did
not
interrupt
our
walk
for
two
hours
we
were
sometimes
led
over
plains
of
sand
sometimes
over
prairies
of
seaweed
that
were
quite
arduous
to
cross
in
all
honesty
i
was
dead
tired
by
the
time
i
spotted
a
hazy
glow
half
a
mile
away
cutting
through
the
darkness
of
the
waters
it
was
the
nautiluss
beacon
within
twenty
minutes
we
would
be
on
board
and
there
i
could
breathe
easy
againbecause
my
tanks
current
air
supply
seemed
to
be
quite
low
in
oxygen
but
i
was
reckoning
without
an
encounter
that
slightly
delayed
our
arrival
i
was
lagging
behind
some
twenty
paces
when
i
saw
captain
nemo
suddenly
come
back
toward
me
with
his
powerful
hands
he
sent
me
buckling
to
the
ground
while
his
companion
did
the
same
to
conseil
at
first
i
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
this
sudden
assault
but
i
was
reassured
to
observe
the
captain
lying
motionless
beside
me
i
was
stretched
out
on
the
seafloor
directly
beneath
some
bushes
of
algae
when
i
raised
my
head
and
spied
two
enormous
masses
hurtling
by
throwing
off
phosphorescent
glimmers
my
blood
turned
cold
in
my
veins
i
saw
that
we
were
under
threat
from
a
fearsome
pair
of
sharks
they
were
blue
sharks
dreadful
maneaters
with
enormous
tails
dull
glassy
stares
and
phosphorescent
matter
oozing
from
holes
around
their
snouts
they
were
like
monstrous
fireflies
that
could
thoroughly
pulverize
a
man
in
their
iron
jaws
i
dont
know
if
conseil
was
busy
with
their
classification
but
as
for
me
i
looked
at
their
silver
bellies
their
fearsome
mouths
bristling
with
teeth
from
a
viewpoint
less
than
scientificmore
as
a
victim
than
as
a
professor
of
natural
history
luckily
these
voracious
animals
have
poor
eyesight
they
went
by
without
noticing
us
grazing
us
with
their
brownish
fins
and
miraculously
we
escaped
a
danger
greater
than
encountering
a
tiger
deep
in
the
jungle
half
an
hour
later
guided
by
its
electric
trail
we
reached
the
nautilus
the
outside
door
had
been
left
open
and
captain
nemo
closed
it
after
we
reentered
the
first
cell
then
he
pressed
a
button
i
heard
pumps
operating
within
the
ship
i
felt
the
water
lowering
around
me
and
in
a
few
moments
the
cell
was
completely
empty
the
inside
door
opened
and
we
passed
into
the
wardrobe
there
our
diving
suits
were
removed
not
without
difficulty
and
utterly
exhausted
faint
from
lack
of
food
and
rest
i
repaired
to
my
stateroom
full
of
wonder
at
this
startling
excursion
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
chapter
18
four
thousand
leagues
under
the
pacific
by
the
next
morning
november
18
i
was
fully
recovered
from
my
exhaustion
of
the
day
before
and
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
just
as
the
nautiluss
chief
officer
was
pronouncing
his
daily
phrase
it
then
occurred
to
me
that
these
words
either
referred
to
the
state
of
the
sea
or
that
they
meant
theres
nothing
in
sight
and
in
truth
the
ocean
was
deserted
not
a
sail
on
the
horizon
the
tips
of
crespo
island
had
disappeared
during
the
night
the
sea
absorbing
every
color
of
the
prism
except
its
blue
rays
reflected
the
latter
in
every
direction
and
sported
a
wonderful
indigo
tint
the
undulating
waves
regularly
took
on
the
appearance
of
watered
silk
with
wide
stripes
i
was
marveling
at
this
magnificent
ocean
view
when
captain
nemo
appeared
he
didnt
seem
to
notice
my
presence
and
began
a
series
of
astronomical
observations
then
his
operations
finished
he
went
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
beacon
housing
his
eyes
straying
over
the
surface
of
the
ocean
meanwhile
some
twenty
of
the
nautiluss
sailorsall
energetic
wellbuilt
fellowsclimbed
onto
the
platform
they
had
come
to
pull
up
the
nets
left
in
our
wake
during
the
night
these
seamen
obviously
belonged
to
different
nationalities
although
indications
of
european
physical
traits
could
be
seen
in
them
all
if
im
not
mistaken
i
recognized
some
irishmen
some
frenchmen
a
few
slavs
and
a
native
of
either
greece
or
crete
even
so
these
men
were
frugal
of
speech
and
used
among
themselves
only
that
bizarre
dialect
whose
origin
i
couldnt
even
guess
so
i
had
to
give
up
any
notions
of
questioning
them
the
nets
were
hauled
on
board
they
were
a
breed
of
trawl
resembling
those
used
off
the
normandy
coast
huge
pouches
held
half
open
by
a
floating
pole
and
a
chain
laced
through
the
lower
meshes
trailing
in
this
way
from
these
iron
glove
makers
the
resulting
receptacles
scoured
the
ocean
floor
and
collected
every
marine
exhibit
in
their
path
that
day
they
gathered
up
some
unusual
specimens
from
these
fishfilled
waterways
anglerfish
whose
comical
movements
qualify
them
for
the
epithet
clowns
black
commerson
anglers
equipped
with
their
antennas
undulating
triggerfish
encircled
by
little
red
bands
bloated
puffers
whose
venom
is
extremely
insidious
some
olivehued
lampreys
snipefish
covered
with
silver
scales
cutlass
fish
whose
electrocuting
power
equals
that
of
the
electric
eel
and
the
electric
ray
scaly
featherbacks
with
brown
crosswise
bands
greenish
codfish
several
varieties
of
goby
etc
finally
some
fish
of
larger
proportions
a
onemeter
jack
with
a
prominent
head
several
fine
bonito
from
the
genus
scomber
decked
out
in
the
colors
blue
and
silver
and
three
magnificent
tuna
whose
high
speeds
couldnt
save
them
from
our
trawl
i
estimate
that
this
cast
of
the
net
brought
in
more
than
1000
pounds
of
fish
it
was
a
fine
catch
but
not
surprising
in
essence
these
nets
stayed
in
our
wake
for
several
hours
incarcerating
an
entire
aquatic
world
in
prisons
made
of
thread
so
we
were
never
lacking
in
provisions
of
the
highest
quality
which
the
nautiluss
speed
and
the
allure
of
its
electric
light
could
continually
replenish
these
various
exhibits
from
the
sea
were
immediately
lowered
down
the
hatch
in
the
direction
of
the
storage
lockers
some
to
be
eaten
fresh
others
to
be
preserved
after
its
fishing
was
finished
and
its
air
supply
renewed
i
thought
the
nautilus
would
resume
its
underwater
excursion
and
i
was
getting
ready
to
return
to
my
stateroom
when
captain
nemo
turned
to
me
and
said
without
further
preamble
look
at
this
ocean
professor
doesnt
it
have
the
actual
gift
of
life
doesnt
it
experience
both
anger
and
affection
last
evening
it
went
to
sleep
just
as
we
did
and
there
it
is
waking
up
after
a
peaceful
night
no
hellos
or
good
mornings
for
this
gent
you
would
have
thought
this
eccentric
individual
was
simply
continuing
a
conversation
wed
already
started
see
he
went
on
its
waking
up
under
the
suns
caresses
its
going
to
relive
its
daily
existence
what
a
fascinating
field
of
study
lies
in
watching
the
play
of
its
organism
it
owns
a
pulse
and
arteries
it
has
spasms
and
i
side
with
the
scholarly
commander
maury
who
discovered
that
it
has
a
circulation
as
real
as
the
circulation
of
blood
in
animals
im
sure
that
captain
nemo
expected
no
replies
from
me
and
it
seemed
pointless
to
pitch
in
with
ah
yes
exactly
or
how
right
you
are
rather
he
was
simply
talking
to
himself
with
long
pauses
between
sentences
he
was
meditating
out
loud
yes
he
said
the
ocean
owns
a
genuine
circulation
and
to
start
it
going
the
creator
of
all
things
has
only
to
increase
its
heat
salt
and
microscopic
animal
life
in
essence
heat
creates
the
different
densities
that
lead
to
currents
and
countercurrents
evaporation
which
is
nil
in
the
high
arctic
regions
and
very
active
in
equatorial
zones
brings
about
a
constant
interchange
of
tropical
and
polar
waters
whats
more
ive
detected
those
falling
and
rising
currents
that
make
up
the
oceans
true
breathing
ive
seen
a
molecule
of
salt
water
heat
up
at
the
surface
sink
into
the
depths
reach
maximum
density
at
2
degrees
centigrade
then
cool
off
grow
lighter
and
rise
again
at
the
poles
youll
see
the
consequences
of
this
phenomenon
and
through
this
law
of
farseeing
nature
youll
understand
why
water
can
freeze
only
at
the
surface
as
the
captain
was
finishing
his
sentence
i
said
to
myself
the
pole
is
this
brazen
individual
claiming
hell
take
us
even
to
that
location
meanwhile
the
captain
fell
silent
and
stared
at
the
element
he
had
studied
so
thoroughly
and
unceasingly
then
going
on
salts
he
said
fill
the
sea
in
considerable
quantities
professor
and
if
you
removed
all
its
dissolved
saline
content
youd
create
a
mass
measuring
4500000
cubic
leagues
which
if
it
were
spread
all
over
the
globe
would
form
a
layer
more
than
ten
meters
high
and
dont
think
that
the
presence
of
these
salts
is
due
merely
to
some
whim
of
nature
no
they
make
ocean
water
less
open
to
evaporation
and
prevent
winds
from
carrying
off
excessive
amounts
of
steam
which
when
condensing
would
submerge
the
temperate
zones
salts
play
a
leading
role
the
role
of
stabilizer
for
the
general
ecology
of
the
globe
captain
nemo
stopped
straightened
up
took
a
few
steps
along
the
platform
and
returned
to
me
as
for
those
billions
of
tiny
animals
he
went
on
those
infusoria
that
live
by
the
millions
in
one
droplet
of
water
800000
of
which
are
needed
to
weigh
one
milligram
their
role
is
no
less
important
they
absorb
the
marine
salts
they
assimilate
the
solid
elements
in
the
water
and
since
they
create
coral
and
madrepores
theyre
the
true
builders
of
limestone
continents
and
so
after
theyve
finished
depriving
our
water
drop
of
its
mineral
nutrients
the
droplet
gets
lighter
rises
to
the
surface
there
absorbs
more
salts
left
behind
through
evaporation
gets
heavier
sinks
again
and
brings
those
tiny
animals
new
elements
to
absorb
the
outcome
a
double
current
rising
and
falling
constant
movement
constant
life
more
intense
than
on
land
more
abundant
more
infinite
such
life
blooms
in
every
part
of
this
ocean
an
element
fatal
to
man
they
say
but
vital
to
myriads
of
animalsand
to
me
when
captain
nemo
spoke
in
this
way
he
was
transfigured
and
he
filled
me
with
extraordinary
excitement
there
he
added
out
there
lies
true
existence
and
i
can
imagine
the
founding
of
nautical
towns
clusters
of
underwater
households
that
like
the
nautilus
would
return
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
to
breathe
each
morning
free
towns
if
ever
there
were
independent
cities
then
again
who
knows
whether
some
tyrant



captain
nemo
finished
his
sentence
with
a
vehement
gesture
then
addressing
me
directly
as
if
to
drive
away
an
ugly
thought
professor
aronnax
he
asked
me
do
you
know
the
depth
of
the
ocean
floor
at
least
captain
i
know
what
the
major
soundings
tell
us
could
you
quote
them
to
me
so
i
can
doublecheck
them
as
the
need
arises
here
i
replied
are
a
few
of
them
that
stick
in
my
memory
if
im
not
mistaken
an
average
depth
of
8200
meters
was
found
in
the
north
atlantic
and
2500
meters
in
the
mediterranean
the
most
remarkable
soundings
were
taken
in
the
south
atlantic
near
the
35th
parallel
and
they
gave
12000
meters
14091
meters
and
15149
meters
all
in
all
its
estimated
that
if
the
sea
bottom
were
made
level
its
average
depth
would
be
about
seven
kilometers
well
professor
captain
nemo
replied
well
show
you
better
than
that
i
hope
as
for
the
average
depth
of
this
part
of
the
pacific
ill
inform
you
that
its
a
mere
4000
meters
this
said
captain
nemo
headed
to
the
hatch
and
disappeared
down
the
ladder
i
followed
him
and
went
back
to
the
main
lounge
the
propeller
was
instantly
set
in
motion
and
the
log
gave
our
speed
as
twenty
miles
per
hour
over
the
ensuing
days
and
weeks
captain
nemo
was
very
frugal
with
his
visits
i
saw
him
only
at
rare
intervals
his
chief
officer
regularly
fixed
the
positions
i
found
reported
on
the
chart
and
in
such
a
way
that
i
could
exactly
plot
the
nautiluss
course
conseil
and
land
spent
the
long
hours
with
me
conseil
had
told
his
friend
about
the
wonders
of
our
undersea
stroll
and
the
canadian
was
sorry
he
hadnt
gone
along
but
i
hoped
an
opportunity
would
arise
for
a
visit
to
the
forests
of
oceania
almost
every
day
the
panels
in
the
lounge
were
open
for
some
hours
and
our
eyes
never
tired
of
probing
the
mysteries
of
the
underwater
world
the
nautiluss
general
heading
was
southeast
and
it
stayed
at
a
depth
between
100
and
150
meters
however
from
lordknowswhat
whim
one
day
it
did
a
diagonal
dive
by
means
of
its
slanting
fins
reaching
strata
located
2000
meters
underwater
the
thermometer
indicated
a
temperature
of
425
degrees
centigrade
which
at
this
depth
seemed
to
be
a
temperature
common
to
all
latitudes
on
november
26
at
three
oclock
in
the
morning
the
nautilus
cleared
the
tropic
of
cancer
at
longitude
172
degrees
on
the
27th
it
passed
in
sight
of
the
hawaiian
islands
where
the
famous
captain
cook
met
his
death
on
february
14
1779
by
then
we
had
fared
4860
leagues
from
our
starting
point
when
i
arrived
on
the
platform
that
morning
i
saw
the
island
of
hawaii
two
miles
to
leeward
the
largest
of
the
seven
islands
making
up
this
group
i
could
clearly
distinguish
the
tilled
soil
on
its
outskirts
the
various
mountain
chains
running
parallel
with
its
coastline
and
its
volcanoes
crowned
by
mauna
kea
whose
elevation
is
5000
meters
above
sea
level
among
other
specimens
from
these
waterways
our
nets
brought
up
some
peacocktailed
flabellarian
coral
polyps
flattened
into
stylish
shapes
and
unique
to
this
part
of
the
ocean
the
nautilus
kept
to
its
southeasterly
heading
on
december
1
it
cut
the
equator
at
longitude
142
degrees
and
on
the
4th
of
the
same
month
after
a
quick
crossing
marked
by
no
incident
we
raised
the
marquesas
islands
three
miles
off
in
latitude
8
degrees
57
south
and
longitude
139

i
spotted
martin
point
on
nuku
hiva
chief
member
of
this
island
group
that
belongs
to
france
i
could
make
out
only
its
wooded
mountains
on
the
horizon
because
captain
nemo
hated
to
hug
shore
there
our
nets
brought
up
some
fine
fish
samples
dolphinfish
with
azure
fins
gold
tails
and
flesh
thats
unrivaled
in
the
entire

nearly
denuded
of

exquisite
in
flavor
knifejaws
with
bony
beaks
yellowish
albacore
that
were
as
tasty
as

all

after
leaving
these
delightful
islands
to
the
protection
of
the
french
flag
the
nautilus
covered
about
2000
miles
from
december
4
to
the
11th
its
navigating
was
marked
by
an
encounter
with
an
immense
school
of
squid
unusual
mollusks
that
are
near
neighbors
of
the
cuttlefish
french
fishermen
give
them
the
name
cuckoldfish
and
they
belong
to
the
class
cephalopoda
family
dibranchiata
consisting
of
themselves
together
with
cuttlefish
and
argonauts
the
naturalists
of
antiquity
made
a
special
study
of
them
and
these
animals
furnished
many
ribald
figures
of
speech
for
soapbox
orators
in
the
greek
marketplace
as
well
as
excellent
dishes
for
the
tables
of
rich
citizens
if
were
to
believe
athenaeus
a
greek
physician
predating
galen
it
was
during
the
night
of
december
910
that
the
nautilus
encountered
this
army
of
distinctly
nocturnal
mollusks
they
numbered
in
the
millions
they
were
migrating
from
the
temperate
zones
toward
zones
still
warmer
following
the
itineraries
of
herring
and
sardines
we
stared
at
them
through
our
thick
glass
windows
they
swam
backward
with
tremendous
speed
moving
by
means
of
their
locomotive
tubes
chasing
fish
and
mollusks
eating
the
little
ones
eaten
by
the
big
ones
and
tossing
in
indescribable
confusion
the
ten
feet
that
nature
has
rooted
in
their
heads
like
a
hairpiece
of
pneumatic
snakes
despite
its
speed
the
nautilus
navigated
for
several
hours
in
the
midst
of
this
school
of
animals
and
its
nets
brought
up
an
incalculable
number
among
which
i
recognized
all
nine
species
that
professor
orbigny
has
classified
as
native
to
the
pacific
ocean
during
this
crossing
the
sea
continually
lavished
us
with
the
most
marvelous
sights
its
variety
was
infinite
it
changed
its
setting
and
decor
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
our
eyes
and
we
were
called
upon
not
simply
to
contemplate
the
works
of
our
creator
in
the
midst
of
the
liquid
element
but
also
to
probe
the
oceans
most
daunting
mysteries
during
the
day
of
december
11
i
was
busy
reading
in
the
main
lounge
ned
land
and
conseil
were
observing
the
luminous
waters
through
the
gaping
panels
the
nautilus
was
motionless
its
ballast
tanks
full
it
was
sitting
at
a
depth
of
1000
meters
in
a
comparatively
unpopulated
region
of
the
ocean
where
only
larger
fish
put
in
occasional
appearances
just
then
i
was
studying
a
delightful
book
by
jean
mac
the
servants
of
the
stomach
and
savoring
its
ingenious
teachings
when
conseil
interrupted
my
reading
would
master
kindly
come
here
for
an
instant
he
said
to
me
in
an
odd
voice
what
is
it
conseil
its
something
that
master
should
see
i
stood
up
went
leaned
on
my
elbows
before
the
window
and
i
saw
it
in
the
broad
electric
daylight
an
enormous
black
mass
quite
motionless
hung
suspended
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
i
observed
it
carefully
trying
to
find
out
the
nature
of
this
gigantic
cetacean
then
a
sudden
thought
crossed
my
mind
a
ship
i
exclaimed
yes
the
canadian
replied
a
disabled
craft
thats
sinking
straight
down
ned
land
was
not
mistaken
we
were
in
the
presence
of
a
ship
whose
severed
shrouds
still
hung
from
their
clasps
its
hull
looked
in
good
condition
and
it
must
have
gone
under
only
a
few
hours
before
the
stumps
of
three
masts
chopped
off
two
feet
above
the
deck
indicated
a
flooding
ship
that
had
been
forced
to
sacrifice
its
masting
but
it
had
heeled
sideways
filling
completely
and
it
was
listing
to
port
even
yet
a
sorry
sight
this
carcass
lost
under
the
waves
but
sorrier
still
was
the
sight
on
its
deck
where
lashed
with
ropes
to
prevent
their
being
washed
overboard
some
human
corpses
still
lay
i
counted
four
of
themfour
men
one
still
standing
at
the
helmthen
a
woman
halfway
out
of
a
skylight
on
the
afterdeck
holding
a
child
in
her
arms
this
woman
was
young
under
the
brilliant
lighting
of
the
nautiluss
rays
i
could
make
out
her
features
which
the
water
hadnt
yet
decomposed
with
a
supreme
effort
she
had
lifted
her
child
above
her
head
and
the
poor
little
creatures
arms
were
still
twined
around
its
mothers
neck
the
postures
of
the
four
seamen
seemed
ghastly
to
me
twisted
from
convulsive
movements
as
if
making
a
last
effort
to
break
loose
from
the
ropes
that
bound
them
to
their
ship
and
the
helmsman
standing
alone
calmer
his
face
smooth
and
serious
his
grizzled
hair
plastered
to
his
brow
his
hands
clutching
the
wheel
seemed
even
yet
to
be
guiding
his
wrecked
threemaster
through
the
ocean
depths
what
a
scene
we
stood
dumbstruck
hearts
pounding
before
this
shipwreck
caught
in
the
act
as
if
it
had
been
photographed
in
its
final
moments
so
to
speak
and
already
i
could
see
enormous
sharks
moving
in
eyes
ablaze
drawn
by
the
lure
of
human
flesh
meanwhile
turning
the
nautilus
made
a
circle
around
the
sinking
ship
and
for
an
instant
i
could
read

board
on
its
stern

vanikoro
this
dreadful
sight
was
the
first
of
a
whole
series
of
maritime
catastrophes
that
the
nautilus
would
encounter
on
its
run
when
it
plied
more
heavily
traveled

we
often
saw
wrecked
hulls
rotting
in
midwater
and
farther
down
cannons
shells
anchors
chains
and
a
thousand
other
iron
objects
rusting
away
meanwhile
continuously
swept
along
by
the
nautilus
where
we
lived
in
near
isolation
we
raised

answered
me
coldly
the
earth

the
most
unusual
in
this
group
which
was
discovered
in
1822
by
captain
bell
aboard
the
minerva
so
i
was
able
to
study
the
madreporic
process
that
has
created
the
islands
in
this
ocean
madrepores
which
one
must
guard
against
confusing
with
precious
coral
clothe
their
tissue
in
a
limestone
crust
and
their
variations
in
structure
have
led
my
famous
mentor
professor
milneedwards
to
classify
them
into
five
divisions
the
tiny
microscopic
animals
that
secrete
this
polypary
live
by
the
billions
in
the
depths
of
their
cells
their
limestone
deposits
build
up
into
rocks
reefs
islets
islands
in
some
places
they
form
atolls
a
circular
ring
surrounding
a
lagoon
or
small
inner
lake
that
gaps
place
in
contact
with
the
sea
elsewhere
they
take
the
shape
of
barrier
reefs
such
as
those
that
exist
along
the
coasts
of
new
caledonia
and
several
of
the
tuamotu
islands
in
still
other
localities
such
as
runion
island
and
the
island
of
mauritius
they
build
fringing
reefs
high
straight
walls
next
to
which
the
oceans
depth
is
considerable
while
cruising
along
only
a
few
cable
lengths
from
the
underpinning
of
reao
island
i
marveled
at
the
gigantic
piece
of
work
accomplished
by
these
microscopic
laborers
these
walls
were
the
express
achievements
of
madrepores
known
by
the
names
fire
coral
finger
coral
star
coral
and
stony
coral
these
polyps
grow
exclusively
in
the
agitated
strata
at
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
so
its
in
the
upper
reaches
that
they
begin
these
substructures
which
sink
little
by
little
together
with
the
secreted
rubble
binding
them
this
at
least
is
the
theory
of
mr
charles
darwin
who
thus
explains
the
formation
of
atollsa
theory
superior
in
my
view
to
the
one
that
says
these
madreporic
edifices
sit
on
the
summits
of
mountains
or
volcanoes
submerged
a
few
feet
below
sea
level
i
could
observe
these
strange
walls
quite
closely
our
sounding
lines
indicated
that
they
dropped
perpendicularly
for
more
than
300
meters
and
our
electric
beams
made
the
bright
limestone
positively
sparkle
in
reply
to
a
question
conseil
asked
me
about
the
growth
rate
of
these
colossal
barriers
i
thoroughly
amazed
him
by
saying
that
scientists
put
it
at
an
eighth
of
an
inch
per
biennium
therefore
he
said
to
me
to
build
these
walls
it
took




192000
years
my
gallant
conseil
which
significantly
extends
the
biblical
days
of
creation
whats
more
the
formation
of
coalin
other
words
the
petrification
of
forests
swallowed
by
floodsand
the
cooling
of
basaltic
rocks
likewise
call
for
a
much
longer
period
of
time
i
might
add
that
those
days
in
the
bible
must
represent
whole
epochs
and
not
literally
the
lapse
of
time
between
two
sunrises
because
according
to
the
bible
itself
the
sun
doesnt
date
from
the
first
day
of
creation
when
the
nautilus
returned
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
i
could
take
in
reao
island
over
its
whole
flat
wooded
expanse
obviously
its
madreporic
rocks
had
been
made
fertile
by
tornadoes
and
thunderstorms
one
day
carried
off
by
a
hurricane
from
neighboring
shores
some
seed
fell
onto
these
limestone
beds
mixing
with
decomposed
particles
of
fish
and
marine
plants
to
form
vegetable

lavished

never
suffered
from

had
cleared
8100
miles
we
logged
9720
miles
when
we
passed
between
the
tonga

where
crews
from

the

ill
let
the
reader
decide
which
of
these
deeds
was
more
beneficial
to
humanity
coming
later
captain
cook
in
1774
rear
admiral
dentrecasteaux
in
1793
and
finally
captain
dumont
durville
in
1827
untangled
the
whole
chaotic
geography
of
this
island
group
the
nautilus
drew
near
wailea
bay
an
unlucky
place
for
englands
captain
dillon
who
was
the
first
to
shed
light
on
the
longstanding
mystery
surrounding
the
disappearance
of
ships
under
the
count
de
la
prouse
this
bay
repeatedly
dredged
furnished
a
huge
supply
of
excellent
oysters
as
the
roman
playwright
seneca
recommended
we
opened
them
right
at
our
table
then
stuffed
ourselves
these
mollusks
belonged
to
the
species
known
by
name
as
ostrea
lamellosa
whose
members
are
quite
common
off
corsica
this
wailea
oysterbank
must
have
been
extensive
and
for
certain
if
they
hadnt
been
controlled
by
numerous
natural
checks
these
clusters
of
shellfish
would
have
ended
up
jampacking
the
bay
since
as
many
as
2000000
eggs
have
been
counted
in
a
single
individual
and
if
mr
ned
land
did
not
repent
of
his
gluttony
at
our
oyster
fest
its
because
oysters
are
the
only
dish
that
never
causes
indigestion
in
fact
it
takes
no
less
than
sixteen
dozen
of
these
headless
mollusks
to
supply
the
315
grams
that
satisfy

the
nautilus
navigated
amid
the
island
group
of
the
new
hebrides
which
the
portuguese
seafarer
queirs
discovered
in
1606
which
commander
bougainville
explored
in
1768
and
to
which
captain
cook
gave
its
current
name
in
1773
this
group
is
chiefly
made
up
of
nine
large
islands
and
forms
a
120league
strip
from
the
northnorthwest
to
the
southsoutheast
lying
between
latitude
2
degrees
and
15
degrees
south
and
between
longitude
164
degrees
and
168
degrees
at
the
moment
of
our
noon
sights
we
passed
fairly
close
to
the
island
of
aurou
which
looked
to
me
like
a
mass
of
green
woods
crowned
by
a
peak
of
great
height
that
day
it
was
yuletide
and
it
struck
me
that
ned
land
badly
missed
celebrating
christmas
that
genuine
family
holiday
where
protestants
are
such
zealots
i
hadnt
seen
captain
nemo
for
over
a
week
when
on
the
morning
of
the
27th
he
entered
the
main
lounge
as
usual
acting
as
if
hed
been
gone
for
just
five
minutes
i
was
busy
tracing
the
nautiluss
course
on
the
world
map
the
captain
approached
placed
a
finger
over
a
position
on
the
chart
and
pronounced
just
one
word
vanikoro
this
name
was
magic
it
was
the
name
of
those
islets
where
vessels
under
the
count
de
la
prouse
had
miscarried
i
straightened
suddenly
the
nautilus
is
bringing
us
to
vanikoro
i
asked
yes
professor
the
captain
replied
and
ill
be
able
to
visit
those
famous
islands
where
the
compass
and
the
astrolabe
came
to
grief
if
you
like
professor
when
will
we
reach
vanikoro
we
already
have
professor
followed
by
captain
nemo
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
and
from
there
my
eyes
eagerly
scanned
the
horizon
in
the
northeast
there
emerged
two
volcanic
islands
of
unequal
size
surrounded
by
a
coral
reef
whose
circuit
measured
forty
miles
we
were
facing
the
island
of
vanikoro
proper
to
which
captain
dumont
durville
had
given
the
name
island
of
the
search
we
lay
right
in
front
of
the
little
harbor
of
vana
located
in
latitude
16
degrees
4
south
and
longitude
164
degrees
32
east
its
shores
seemed
covered
with
greenery
from
its
beaches
to
its
summits
inland
crowned
by
mt
kapogo
which
is
476
fathoms
high
after
clearing
the
outer
belt
of
rocks
via
a
narrow
passageway
the
nautilus
lay
inside
the
breakers
where
the
sea
had
a
depth
of
thirty
to
forty
fathoms
under
the
green
shade
of
some
tropical
evergreens
i
spotted
a
few
savages
who
looked
extremely
startled
at
our
approach
in
this
long
blackish
object
advancing
flush
with
the
water
didnt
they
see
some
fearsome
cetacean
that
they
were
obliged
to
view
with
distrust
just
then
captain
nemo
asked
me
what
i
knew
about
the
shipwreck
of
the
count
de
la
prouse
what
everybody
knows
captain
i
answered
him
and
could
you
kindly
tell
me
what
everybody
knows
he
asked
me
in
a
gently
ironic
tone
very
easily
i
related
to
him
what
the
final
deeds
of
captain
dumont
durville
had
brought
to
light
deeds
described
here
in
this
heavily
condensed
summary
of
the
whole
matter
in
1785
the
count
de
la
prouse
and
his
subordinate
captain
de
langle
were
sent
by
king
louis
xvi
of
france
on
a
voyage
to
circumnavigate
the
globe
they
boarded
two
sloops
of
war
the
compass
and
the
astrolabe
which
were
never
seen
again
in
1791
justly
concerned
about
the
fate
of
these
two
sloops
of
war
the
french
government
fitted
out
two
large
cargo
boats
the
search
and
the
hope
which
left
brest
on
september
28
under
orders
from
rear
admiral
bruni
dentrecasteaux
two
months
later
testimony
from
a
certain
commander
bowen
aboard
the
albemarle
alleged
that
rubble
from
shipwrecked
vessels
had
been
seen
on
the
coast
of
new
georgia
but
dentrecasteaux
was
unaware
of
this
newswhich
seemed
a
bit
dubious
anyhowand
headed
toward
the
admiralty
islands
which
had
been
named
in
a
report
by
one
captain
hunter
as
the
site
of
the
count
de
la
prouses
shipwreck
they
looked
in
vain
the
hope
and
the
search
passed
right
by
vanikoro
without
stopping
there
and
overall
this
voyage
was
plagued
by
misfortune
ultimately
costing
the
lives
of
rear
admiral
dentrecasteaux
two
of
his
subordinate
officers
and
several
seamen
from
his
crew
it
was
an
old
hand
at
the
pacific
the
english
adventurer
captain
peter
dillon
who
was
the
first
to
pick
up
the
trail
left
by
castaways
from
the
wrecked
vessels
on
may
15
1824
his
ship
the
st
patrick
passed
by
tikopia
island
one
of
the
new
hebrides
there
a
native
boatman
pulled
alongside
in
a
dugout
canoe
and
sold
dillon
a
silver
sword
hilt
bearing
the
imprint
of
characters
engraved
with
a
cutting
tool
known
as
a
burin
furthermore
this
native
boatman
claimed
that
during
a
stay
in
vanikoro
six
years
earlier
he
had
seen
two
europeans
belonging
to
ships
that
had
run
aground
on
the
islands
reefs
many
years
before
dillon
guessed
that
the
ships
at
issue
were
those
under
the
count
de
la
prouse
ships
whose
disappearance
had
shaken
the
entire
world
he
tried
to
reach
vanikoro
where
according
to
the
native
boatman
a
good
deal
of
rubble
from
the
shipwreck
could
still
be
found
but
winds
and
currents
prevented
his
doing
so
dillon
returned
to
calcutta
there
he
was
able
to
interest
the
asiatic
society
and
the
east
india
company
in
his
discovery
a
ship
named
after
the
search
was
placed
at
his
disposal
and
he
departed
on
january
23
1827
accompanied
by
a
french
deputy
this
new
search
after
putting
in
at
several
stops
over
the
pacific
dropped
anchor
before
vanikoro
on
july
7
1827
in
the
same
harbor
of
vana
where
the
nautilus
was
currently
floating
there
dillon
collected
many
relics
of
the
shipwreck
iron
utensils
anchors
eyelets
from
pulleys
swivel
guns
an
eighteenpound
shell
the
remains
of
some
astronomical
instruments
a
piece
of
sternrail
and
a
bronze
bell
bearing
the
inscription
made
by
bazin
the
foundry
mark
at
brest
arsenal
around
1785
there
could
no
longer
be
any
doubt
finishing
his
investigations
dillon
stayed
at
the
site
of
the
casualty
until
the
month
of
october
then
he
left
vanikoro
headed
toward
new
zealand
dropped
anchor
at
calcutta
on
april
7
1828
and
returned
to
france
where
he
received
a
very
cordial
welcome
from
king
charles
x
but
just
then
the
renowned
french
explorer
captain
dumont
durville
unaware
of
dillons
activities
had
already
set
sail
to
search
elsewhere
for
the
site
of
the
shipwreck
in
essence
a
whaling
vessel
had
reported
that
some
medals
and
a
cross
of
st
louis
had
been
found
in
the
hands
of
savages
in
the
louisiade
islands
and
new
caledonia
so
captain
dumont
durville
had
put
to
sea
in
command
of
a
vessel
named
after
the
astrolabe
and
just
two
months
after
dillon
had
left
vanikoro
dumont
durville
dropped
anchor
before
hobart
there
he
heard
about
dillons
findings
and
he
further
learned
that
a
certain
james
hobbs
chief
officer
on
the
union
out
of
calcutta
had
put
to
shore
on
an
island
located
in
latitude
8
degrees
18
south
and
longitude
156
degrees
30
east
and
had
noted
the
natives
of
those
waterways
making
use
of
iron
bars
and
red
fabrics
pretty
perplexed
dumont
durville
didnt
know
if
he
should
give
credence
to
these
reports
which
had
been
carried
in
some
of
the
less
reliable
newspapers
nevertheless
he
decided
to
start
on
dillons
trail
on
february
10
1828
the
new
astrolabe
hove
before
tikopia
island
took
on
a
guide
and
interpreter
in
the
person
of
a
deserter
who
had
settled
there
plied
a
course
toward
vanikoro
raised
it
on
february
12
sailed
along
its
reefs
until
the
14th
and
only
on
the
20th
dropped
anchor
inside
its
barrier
in
the
harbor
of
vana
on
the
23rd
several
officers
circled
the
island
and
brought
back
some
rubble
of
little
importance
the
natives
adopting
a
system
of
denial
and
evasion
refused
to
guide
them
to
the
site
of
the
casualty
this
rather
shady
conduct
aroused
the
suspicion
that
the
natives
had
mistreated
the
castaways
and
in
truth
the
natives
seemed
afraid
that
dumont
durville
had
come
to
avenge
the
count
de
la
prouse
and
his
unfortunate
companions
but
on
the
26th
appeased
with
gifts
and
seeing
that
they
didnt
need
to
fear
any
reprisals
the
natives
led
the
chief
officer
mr
jacquinot
to
the
site
of
the
shipwreck
at
this
location
in
three
or
four
fathoms
of
water
between
the
paeu
and
vana
reefs
there
lay
some
anchors
cannons
and
ingots
of
iron
and
lead
all
caked
with
limestone
concretions
a
launch
and
whaleboat
from
the
new
astrolabe
were
steered
to
this
locality
and
after
going
to
exhausting
lengths
their
crews
managed
to
dredge
up
an
anchor
weighing
1800
pounds
a
castiron
eightpounder
cannon
a
lead
ingot
and
two
copper
swivel
guns
questioning
the
natives
captain
dumont
durville
also
learned
that
after
la
prouses
two
ships
had
miscarried
on
the
islands
reefs
the
count
had
built
a
smaller
craft
only
to
go
off
and
miscarry
a
second
time
where
nobody
knew
the
commander
of
the
new
astrolabe
then
had
a
monument
erected
under
a
tuft
of
mangrove
in
memory
of
the
famous
navigator
and
his
companions
it
was
a
simple
quadrangular
pyramid
set
on
a
coral
base
with
no
ironwork
to
tempt
the
natives
avarice
then
dumont
durville
tried
to
depart
but
his
crews
were
run
down
from
the
fevers
raging
on
these
unsanitary
shores
and
quite
ill
himself
he
was
unable
to
weigh
anchor
until
march
17
meanwhile
fearing
that
dumont
durville
wasnt
abreast
of
dillons
activities
the
french
government
sent
a
sloop
of
war
to
vanikoro
the
bayonnaise
under
commander
legoarant
de
tromelin
who
had
been
stationed
on
the
american
west
coast
dropping
anchor
before
vanikoro
a
few
months
after
the
new
astrolabes
departure
the
bayonnaise
didnt
find
any
additional
evidence
but
verified
that
the
savages
hadnt
disturbed
the
memorial
honoring
the
count
de
la
prouse
this
is
the
substance
of
the
account
i
gave
captain
nemo
so
he
said
to
me
the
castaways
built
a
third
ship
on
vanikoro
island
and
to
this
day
nobody
knows
where
it
went
and
perished
nobody
knows
captain
nemo
didnt
reply
but
signaled
me
to
follow
him
to
the
main
lounge
the
nautilus
sank
a
few
meters
beneath
the
waves
and
the
panels
opened
i
rushed
to
the
window
and
saw
crusts
of
coral
fungus
coral
siphonula
coral
alcyon
coral
sea
anemone
from
the
genus
caryophylia
plus
myriads
of
charming
fish
including
greenfish
damselfish
sweepers
snappers
and
squirrelfish
underneath
this
coral
covering
i
detected
some
rubble
the
old
dredges
hadnt
been
able
to
tear
freeiron
stirrups
anchors
cannons
shells
tackle
from
a
capstan
a
stempost
all
objects
hailing
from
the
wrecked
ships
and
now
carpeted
in
moving
flowers
and
as
i
stared
at
this
desolate
wreckage
captain
nemo
told
me
in
a
solemn
voice
commander
la
prouse
set
out
on
december
7
1785
with
his
ships
the
compass
and
the
astrolabe
he
dropped
anchor
first
at
botany
bay
visited
the
tonga
islands
and
new
caledonia
headed
toward
the
santa
cruz
islands
and
put
in
at
nomuka
one
of
the
islands
in
the
haapai
group
then
his
ships
arrived
at
the
unknown
reefs
of
vanikoro
traveling
in
the
lead
the
compass
ran
afoul
of
breakers
on
the
southerly
coast
the
astrolabe
went
to
its
rescue
and
also
ran
aground
the
first
ship
was
destroyed
almost
immediately
the
second
stranded
to
leeward
held
up
for
some
days
the
natives
gave
the
castaways
a
fair
enough
welcome
the
latter
took
up
residence
on
the
island
and
built
a
smaller
craft
with
rubble
from
the
two
large
ones
a
few
seamen
stayed
voluntarily
in
vanikoro
the
others
weak
and
ailing
set
sail
with
the
count
de
la
prouse
they
headed
to
the
solomon
islands
and
they
perished
with
all
hands
on
the
westerly
coast
of
the
chief
island
in
that
group
between
cape
deception
and
cape
satisfaction
and
how
do
you
know
all
this
i
exclaimed
heres
what
i
found
at
the
very
site
of
that
final
shipwreck
captain
nemo
showed
me
a
tin
box
stamped
with
the
coat
of
arms
of
france
and
all
corroded
by
salt
water
he
opened
it
and
i
saw
a
bundle
of
papers
yellowed
but
still
legible
they
were
the
actual
military
orders
given
by
frances
minister
of
the
navy
to
commander
la
prouse
with
notes
along
the
margin
in
the
handwriting
of
king
louis
xvi
ah
what
a
splendid
death
for
a
seaman
captain
nemo
then
said
a
coral
grave
is
a
tranquil
grave
and
may
heaven
grant
that
my
companions
and
i
rest
in
no
other
chapter
20
the
torres
strait
during
the
night
of
december
2728
the
nautilus
left
the
waterways
of
vanikoro
behind
with
extraordinary
speed
its
heading
was
southwesterly
and
in
three
days
it
had
cleared
the
750
leagues
that
separated
la
prouses
islands
from
the
southeastern
tip
of
papua
on
january
1
1868
bright
and
early
conseil
joined
me
on
the
platform
will
master
the
gallant
lad
said
to
me
allow
me
to
wish
him
a
happy
new
year
good
heavens
conseil
its
just
like
old
times
in
my
office
at
the
botanical
gardens
in
paris
i
accept
your
kind
wishes
and
i
thank
you
for
them
only
id
like
to
know
what
you
mean
by
a
happy
year
under
the
circumstances
in
which
were
placed
is
it
a
year
that
will
bring
our
imprisonment
to
an
end
or
a
year
that
will
see
this
strange
voyage
continue
ye
gods
conseil
replied
i
hardly
know
what
to
tell
master
were
certainly
seeing
some
unusual
things
and
for
two
months
weve
had
no
time
for
boredom
the
latest
wonder
is
always
the
most
astonishing
and
if
this
progression
keeps
up
i
cant
imagine
what
its
climax
will
be
in
my
opinion
well
never
again
have
such
an
opportunity
never
conseil
besides
mr
nemo
really
lives
up
to
his
latin
name
since
he
couldnt
be
less
in
the
way
if
he
didnt
exist
true
enough
conseil
therefore
with
all
due
respect
to
master
i
think
a
happy
year
would
be
a
year
that
lets
us
see
everything
everything
conseil
no
year
could
be
that
long
but
what
does
ned
land
think
about
all
this
ned
lands
thoughts
are
exactly
the
opposite
of
mine
conseil
replied
he
has
a
practical
mind
and
a
demanding
stomach
hes
tired
of
staring
at
fish
and
eating
them
day
in
and
day
out
this
shortage
of
wine
bread
and
meat
isnt
suitable
for
an
upstanding
anglosaxon
a
man
accustomed
to
beefsteak
and
unfazed
by
regular
doses
of
brandy
or
gin
for
my
part
conseil
that
doesnt
bother
me
in
the
least
and
ive
adjusted
very
nicely
to
the
diet
on
board
so
have
i
conseil
replied
accordingly
i
think
as
much
about
staying
as
mr
land
about
making
his
escape
thus
if
this
new
year
isnt
a
happy
one
for
me
it
will
be
for
him
and
vice
versa
no
matter
what
happens
one
of
us
will
be
pleased
so
in
conclusion
i
wish
master
to
have
whatever
his
heart
desires
thank
you
conseil
only
i
must
ask
you
to
postpone
the
question
of
new
years
gifts
and
temporarily
accept
a
hearty
handshake
in
their
place
thats
all
i
have
on
me
master
has
never
been
more
generous
conseil
replied
and
with
that
the
gallant
lad
went
away
by
january
2
we
had
fared
11340
miles
hence
5250
leagues
from
our
starting
point
in
the
seas
of
japan
before
the
nautiluss
spur
there
stretched
the
dangerous
waterways
of
the
coral
sea
off
the
northeast
coast
of
australia
our
boat
cruised
along
a
few
miles
away
from
that
daunting
shoal
where
captain
cooks
ships
wellnigh
miscarried
on
june
10
1770
the
craft
that
cook
was
aboard
charged
into
some
coral
rock
and
if
his
vessel
didnt
go
down
it
was
thanks
to
the
circumstance
that
a
piece
of
coral
broke
off
in
the
collision
and
plugged
the
very
hole
it
had
made
in
the
hull
i
would
have
been
deeply
interested
in
visiting
this
long
360league
reef
against
which
the
eversurging
sea
broke
with
the
fearsome
intensity
of
thunderclaps
but
just
then
the
nautiluss
slanting
fins
took
us
to
great
depths
and
i
could
see
nothing
of
those
high
coral
walls
i
had
to
rest
content
with
the
various
specimens
of
fish
brought
up
by
our
nets
among
others
i
noted
some
longfinned
albacore
a
species
in
the
genus
scomber
as
big
as
tuna
bluish
on
the
flanks
and
streaked
with
crosswise
stripes
that
disappear
when
the
animal
dies
these
fish
followed
us
in
schools
and
supplied
our
table
with
very
dainty
flesh
we
also
caught
a
large
number
of
yellowgreen
gilthead
half
a
decimeter
long
and
tasting
like
dorado
plus
some
flying
gurnards
authentic
underwater
swallows
that
on
dark
nights
alternately
streak
air

two
days
after
crossing
the
coral
sea
we
raised
the
coast
of
papua
on
this
occasion
captain
nemo
told
me
that
he
intended
to
reach
the
indian
ocean
via
the
torres
strait
this
was
the
extent
of
his
remarks
ned
saw
with
pleasure
that
this
course
would
bring
us
once
again
closer
to
european
seas
the
torres
strait
is
regarded
as
no
less
dangerous
for
its
bristling
reefs
than
for
the
savage
inhabitants
of
its
coasts
it
separates
queensland
from
the

at
noon
while
the
chief
officer
was
taking
the
suns
altitude
i
spotted
the
summits
of
the
arfak
mountains
rising
in
terraces
and
ending
in
sharp
peaks
discovered
in
1511
by
the
portuguese
francisco

mr
de

has
said
and
i
hadnt
the
foggiest
inkling
that
sailors
luck
was
about
to
bring
me
face
to
face
with
these
daunting
andaman
aborigines
so
the
nautilus
hove
before
the
entrance
to
the
worlds
most
dangerous
strait
a
passageway
that
even
the
boldest
navigators
hesitated
to
clear
the
strait
that
luis
vaez
de
torres
faced
on
returning
from
the
south
seas
in
melanesia
the
strait
in
which
sloops
of
war
under
captain
dumont
durville
ran
aground
in
1840
and
nearly
miscarried
with
all
hands
and
even
the
nautilus
rising
superior
to
every
danger
in
the
sea
was
about
to
become
intimate
with
its
coral
reefs
the
torres
strait
is
about
thirtyfour
leagues
wide
but
its
obstructed
by
an
incalculable
number
of
islands
islets
breakers
and
rocks
that
make
it
nearly
impossible
to
navigate
consequently
captain
nemo
took
every
desired
precaution
in
crossing
it
floating
flush
with
the
water
the
nautilus
moved
ahead
at
a
moderate
pace
like
a
cetaceans
tail
its
propeller
churned
the
waves
slowly
taking
advantage
of
this
situation
my
two
companions
and
i
found
seats
on
the
everdeserted
platform
in
front
of
us
stood
the
pilothouse
and
unless
im
extremely
mistaken
captain
nemo
must
have
been
inside
steering
his
nautilus
himself
under
my
eyes
i
had
the
excellent
charts
of
the
torres
strait
that
had
been
surveyed
and
drawn
up
by
the
hydrographic
engineer
vincendon
dumoulin
and
sublieutenant
now
admiral
coupventdesbois
who
were
part
of
dumont
durvilles
general
staff
during
his
final
voyage
to
circumnavigate
the
globe
these
along
with
the
efforts
of
captain
king
are
the
best
charts
for
untangling
the
snarl
of
this
narrow
passageway
and
i
consulted
them
with
scrupulous
care
around
the
nautilus
the
sea
was
boiling
furiously
a
stream
of
waves
bearing
from
southeast
to
northwest
at
a
speed
of
two
and
a
half
miles
per
hour
broke
over
heads
of
coral
emerging
here
and
there
thats
one
rough
sea
ned
land
told
me
abominable
indeed
i
replied
and
hardly
suitable
for
a
craft
like
the
nautilus
that
damned
captain
the
canadian
went
on
must
really
be
sure
of
his
course
because
if
these
clumps
of
coral
so
much
as
brush
us
theyll
rip
our
hull
into
a
thousand
pieces
the
situation
was
indeed
dangerous
but
as
if
by
magic
the
nautilus
seemed
to
glide
right
down
the
middle
of
these
rampaging
reefs
it
didnt
follow
the
exact
course
of
the
zealous
and
the
new
astrolabe
which
had
proved
so
illfated
for
captain
dumont
durville
it
went
more
to
the
north
hugged
the
murray
islands
and
returned
to
the
southwest
near
cumberland
passage
i
thought
it
was
about
to
charge
wholeheartedly
into
this
opening
but
it
went
up
to
the
northwest
through
a
large
number
of
littleknown
islands
and
islets
and
steered
toward
tound
island
and
the
bad
channel
i
was
already
wondering
if
captain
nemo
rash
to
the
point
of
sheer
insanity
wanted
his
ship
to
tackle
the
narrows
where
dumont
durvilles
two
sloops
of
war
had
gone
aground
when
he
changed
direction
a
second
time
and
cut
straight
to
the
west
heading
toward
gueboroa
island
by
then
it
was
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
the
current
was
slacking
off
it
was
almost
full
tide
the
nautilus
drew
near
this
island
which
i
can
see
to
this
day
with
its
remarkable
fringe
of
screw
pines
we
hugged
it
from
less
than
two
miles
out
a
sudden
jolt
threw
me
down
the
nautilus
had
just
struck
a
reef
and
it
remained
motionless
listing
slightly
to
port
when
i
stood
up
i
saw
captain
nemo
and
his
chief
officer
on
the
platform
they
were
examining
the
ships
circumstances
exchanging
a
few
words
in
their
incomprehensible
dialect
here
is
what
those
circumstances
entailed
two
miles
to
starboard
lay
gueboroa
island
its
coastline
curving
north
to
west
like
an
immense
arm
to
the
south
and
east
heads
of
coral
were
already
on
display
left
uncovered
by
the
ebbing
waters
we
had
run
aground
at
full
tide
and
in
one
of
those
seas
whose
tides
are
moderate
an
inconvenient
state
of
affairs
for
floating
the
nautilus
off
however
the
ship
hadnt
suffered
in
any
way
so
solidly
joined
was
its
hull
but
although
it
could
neither
sink
nor
split
open
it
was
in
serious
danger
of
being
permanently
attached
to
these
reefs
and
that
would
have
been
the
finish
of
captain
nemos
submersible
i
was
mulling
this
over
when
the
captain
approached
cool
and
calm
forever
in
control
of
himself
looking
neither
alarmed
nor
annoyed
an
accident
i
said
to
him
no
an
incident
he
answered
me
but
an
incident
i
replied
that
may
oblige
you
to
become
a
resident
again
of
these
shores
you
avoid
captain
nemo
gave
me
an
odd
look
and
gestured
no
which
told
me
pretty
clearly
that
nothing
would
ever
force
him
to
set
foot
on
a
land
mass
again
then
he
said
no
professor
aronnax
the
nautilus
isnt
consigned
to
perdition
it
will
still
carry
you
through
the
midst
of
the
oceans
wonders
our
voyage
is
just
beginning
and
ive
no
desire
to
deprive
myself
so
soon
of
the
pleasure
of
your
company
even
so
captain
nemo
i
went
on
ignoring
his
ironic
turn
of
phrase
the
nautilus
has
run
aground
at
a
moment
when
the
sea
is
full
now
then
the
tides
arent
strong
in
the
pacific
and
if
you
cant
unballast
the
nautilus
which
seems
impossible
to
me
i
dont
see
how
it
will
float
off
youre
right
professor
the
pacific
tides
arent
strong
captain
nemo
replied
but
in
the
torres
strait
one
still
finds
a
meterandahalf
difference
in
level
between
high
and
low
seas
today
is
january
4
and
in
five
days
the
moon
will
be
full
now
then
ill
be
quite
astonished
if
that
goodnatured
satellite
doesnt
sufficiently
raise
these
masses
of
water
and
do
me
a
favor
for
which
ill
be
forever
grateful
this
said
captain
nemo
went
below
again
to
the
nautiluss
interior
followed
by
his
chief
officer
as
for
our
craft
it
no
longer
stirred
staying
as
motionless
as
if
these
coral
polyps
had
already
walled
it
in
with
their
indestructible
cement
well
sir
ned
land
said
to
me
coming
up
after
the
captains
departure
well
ned
my
friend
well
serenely
wait
for
the
tide
on
the
9th
because
it
seems
the
moon
will
have
the
good
nature
to
float
us
away
as
simple
as
that
as
simple
as
that
so
our
captain
isnt
going
to
drop
his
anchors
put
his
engines
on
the
chains
and
do
anything
to
haul
us
off
since
the
tide
will
be
sufficient
conseil
replied
simply
the
canadian
stared
at
conseil
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
seaman
in
him
was
talking
now
sir
he
answered
you
can
trust
me
when
i
say
this
hunk
of
iron
will
never
navigate
again
on
the
seas
or
under
them
its
only
fit
to
be
sold
for
its
weight
so
i
think
its
time
we
gave
captain
nemo
the
slip
ned
my
friend
i
replied
unlike
you
i
havent
given
up
on
our
valiant
nautilus
and
in
four
days
well
know
where
we
stand
on
these
pacific
tides
besides
an
escape
attempt
might
be
timely
if
we
were
in
sight
of
the
coasts
of
england
or
provence
but
in
the
waterways
of
papua
its
another
story
and
well
always
have
that
as
a
last
resort
if
the
nautilus
doesnt
right
itself
which
id
regard
as
a
real
calamity
but
couldnt
we
at
least
get
the
lay
of
the
land
ned
went
on
heres
an
island
on
this
island
there
are
trees
under
those
trees
land
animals
loaded
with
cutlets
and
roast
beef
which
id
be
happy
to
sink
my
teeth
into
in
this
instance
our
friend
ned
is
right
conseil
said
and
i
side
with
his
views
couldnt
master
persuade
his
friend
captain
nemo
to
send
the
three
of
us
ashore
if
only
so
our
feet
dont
lose
the
knack
of
treading
on
the
solid
parts
of
our
planet
i
can
ask
him
i
replied
but
hell
refuse
let
master
take
the
risk
conseil
said
and
well
know
where
we
stand
on
the
captains
affability
much
to
my
surprise
captain
nemo
gave
me
the
permission
i
asked
for
and
he
did
so
with
grace
and
alacrity
not
even
exacting
my
promise
to
return
on
board
but
fleeing
across
the
new
guinea
territories
would
be
extremely
dangerous
and
i
wouldnt
have
advised
ned
land
to
try
it
better
to
be
prisoners
aboard
the
nautilus
than
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
papuan
natives
the
skiff
was
put
at
our
disposal
for
the
next
morning
i
hardly
needed
to
ask
whether
captain
nemo
would
be
coming
along
i
likewise
assumed
that
no
crewmen
would
be
assigned
to
us
that
ned
land
would
be
in
sole
charge
of
piloting
the
longboat
besides
the
shore
lay
no
more
than
two
miles
off
and
it
would
be
childs
play
for
the
canadian
to
guide
that
nimble
skiff
through
those
rows
of
reefs
so
illfated
for
big
ships
the
next
day
january
5
after
its
deck
paneling
was
opened
the
skiff
was
wrenched
from
its
socket
and
launched
to
sea
from
the
top
of
the
platform
two
men
were
sufficient
for
this
operation
the
oars
were
inside
the
longboat
and
we
had
only
to
take
our
seats
at
eight
oclock
armed
with
rifles
and
axes
we
pulled
clear
of
the
nautilus
the
sea
was
fairly
calm
a
mild
breeze
blew
from
shore
in
place
by
the
oars
conseil
and
i
rowed
vigorously
and
ned
steered
us
into
the
narrow
lanes
between
the
breakers
the
skiff
handled
easily
and
sped
swiftly
ned
land
couldnt
conceal
his
glee
he
was
a
prisoner
escaping
from
prison
and
never
dreaming
he
would
need
to
reenter
it
meat
he
kept
repeating
now
well
eat
red
meat
actual
game
a
real
mess
call
by
thunder
im
not
saying
fish
arent
good
for
you
but
we
mustnt

making
my
mouth
water
it
remains
to
be
seen
i
said
whether
these
forests
do
contain
game
and
if
the
types
of
game
arent
of
such
size
that
they
can
hunt

replied
the
canadian
whose
teeth
seemed
to
be
as
honed
as
the
edge
of
an
ax
but
if
theres
no

on
any

the

replied
i
only
need
twentyfive
minutes
to
serve
you
one
of
my
own
special
creations
by

the
nautiluss
skiff
had
just
run
gently
aground
on
a
sandy
strand

successfully
clearing
the
ring
of
coral
that
surrounds

some
days
ashore
stepping
ashore
had
an
exhilarating
effect
on
me
ned
land
tested
the
soil
with
his
foot
as
if
he
were
laying
claim
to
it
yet
it
had
been
only
two
months
since
we
had
become
as
captain
nemo
expressed
it
passengers
on
the
nautilus
in
other
words
the
literal
prisoners
of
its
commander
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
a
gunshot
away
from
the
coast
the
soil
was
almost
entirely
madreporic
but
certain
dry
stream
beds
were
strewn
with
granite
rubble
proving
that
this
island
was
of
primordial
origin
the
entire
horizon
was
hidden
behind
a
curtain
of
wonderful
forests
enormous
trees
sometimes
as
high
as
200
feet
were
linked
to
each
other
by
garlands
of
tropical
creepers
genuine
natural
hammocks
that
swayed
in
a
mild
breeze
there
were
mimosas
banyan
trees
beefwood
teakwood
hibiscus
screw
pines
palm
trees
all
mingling
in
wild
profusion
and
beneath
the
shade
of
their
green
canopies
at
the
feet
of
their
gigantic
trunks
there
grew
orchids
leguminous
plants
and
ferns
meanwhile
ignoring
all
these
fine
specimens
of
papuan
flora
the
canadian
passed
up
the
decorative
in
favor
of
the
functional
he
spotted
a
coconut
palm
beat
down
some
of
its
fruit
broke
them
open
and
we
drank
their
milk
and
ate
their
meat
with
a
pleasure
that
was
a
protest
against
our
standard
fare
on
the
nautilus
excellent
ned
land
said
exquisite
conseil
replied
and
i
dont
think
the
canadian
said
that
your
nemo
would
object
to
us
stashing
a
cargo
of
coconuts
aboard
his
vessel
i
imagine
not
i
replied
but
he
wont
want
to
sample
them
too
bad
for
him
conseil
said
and
plenty
good
for
us
ned
land
shot
back
therell
be
more
left
over
a
word
of
caution
mr
land
i
told
the
harpooner
who
was
about
to
ravage
another
coconut
palm
coconuts
are
admirable
things
but
before
we
stuff
the
skiff
with
them
it
would
be
wise
to
find
out
whether
this
island
offers
other
substances
just
as
useful
some
fresh
vegetables
would
be
well
received
in
the
nautiluss
pantry
master
is
right
conseil
replied
and
i
propose
that
we
set
aside
three
places
in
our
longboat
one
for
fruit
another
for
vegetables
and
a
third
for
venison
of
which
i
still
havent
glimpsed
the
tiniest
specimen
dont
give
up
so
easily
conseil
the
canadian
replied
so
lets
continue
our
excursion
i
went
on
but
keep
a
sharp
lookout
this
island
seems
uninhabited
but
it
still
might
harbor
certain
individuals
who
arent
so
finicky
about
the
sort
of
game
they
eat
hee
hee
ned
put
in
with
a
meaningful
movement
of
his
jaws
ned
oh
horrors
conseil
exclaimed
ye
gods
the
canadian
shot
back
im
starting
to
appreciate
the
charms
of
cannibalism
ned
ned
dont
say
that
conseil
answered
you
a
cannibal
why
ill
no
longer
be
safe
next
to
you
i
who
share
your
cabin
does
this
mean
ill
wake
up
half
devoured
one
fine
day
im
awfully
fond
of
you
conseil
my
friend
but
not
enough
to
eat
you
when
theres
better
food
around
then
i
darent
delay
conseil
replied
the
hunt
is
on
we
absolutely
must
bag
some
game
to
placate
this
maneater
or
one
of
these
mornings
master
wont
find
enough
pieces
of
his
manservant
to
serve
him
while
exchanging
this
chitchat
we
entered
beneath
the
dark
canopies
of
the
forest
and
for
two
hours
we
explored
it
in
every
direction
we
couldnt
have
been
luckier
in
our
search
for
edible
vegetation
and
some
of
the
most
useful
produce
in
the
tropical
zones
supplied
us
with
a
valuable
foodstuff
missing
on
board
i
mean
the
breadfruit
tree
which
is
quite
abundant
on
gueboroa
island
and
there
i
chiefly
noted
the
seedless
variety
that
in
malaysia
is
called
rima
this
tree
is
distinguished
from
other
trees
by
a
straight
trunk
forty
feet
high
to
the
naturalists
eye
its
gracefully
rounded
crown
formed
of
big
multilobed
leaves
was
enough
to
denote
the
artocarpus
that
has
been
so
successfully
transplanted
to
the
mascarene
islands
east
of
madagascar
from
its
mass
of
greenery
huge
globular
fruit
stood
out
a
decimeter
wide
and
furnished
on
the
outside
with
creases
that
assumed
a
hexangular
pattern
its
a
handy
plant
that
nature
gives
to
regions
lacking
in
wheat
without
needing
to
be
cultivated
it
bears
fruit
eight
months
out
of
the
year
ned
land
was
on
familiar
terms
with
this
fruit
he
had
already
eaten
it
on
his
many
voyages
and
knew
how
to
cook
its
edible
substance
so
the
very
sight
of
it
aroused
his
appetite
and
he
couldnt
control
himself
sir
he
told
me
ill
die
if
i
dont
sample
a
little
breadfruit
pasta
sample
some
ned
my
friend
sample
all
you
like
were
here
to
conduct
experiments
lets
conduct
them
it
wont
take
a
minute
the
canadian
replied
equipped
with
a
magnifying
glass
he
lit
a
fire
of
deadwood
that
was
soon
crackling
merrily
meanwhile
conseil
and
i
selected
the
finest
artocarpus
fruit
some
still
werent
ripe
enough
and
their
thick
skins
covered
white
slightly
fibrous
pulps
but
a
great
many
others
were
yellowish
and
gelatinous
just
begging
to
be
picked
this
fruit
contained
no
pits
conseil
brought
a
dozen
of
them
to
ned
land
who
cut
them
into
thick
slices
and
placed
them
over
a
fire
of
live
coals
all
the
while
repeating
youll
see
sir
how
tasty
this
bread
is
especially
since
weve
gone
without
baked
goods
for
so
long
conseil
said
its
more
than
just
bread
the
canadian
added
its
a
dainty
pastry
youve
never
eaten
any
sir
no
ned
all
right
get
ready
for
something
downright
delectable
if
you
dont
come
back
for
seconds
im
no
longer
the
king
of
harpooners
after
a
few
minutes
the
parts
of
the
fruit
exposed
to
the
fire
were
completely
toasted
on
the
inside
there
appeared
some
white
pasta
a
sort
of
soft
bread
center
whose
flavor
reminded
me
of
artichoke
this
bread
was
excellent
i
must
admit
and
i
ate
it
with
great
pleasure
unfortunately
i
said
this
pasta
wont
stay
fresh
so
it
seems
pointless
to
make
a
supply
for
on
board
by
thunder
sir
ned
land
exclaimed
there
you
go
talking
like
a
naturalist
but
meantime
ill
be
acting
like
a
baker
conseil
harvest
some
of
this
fruit
to
take
with
us
when
we
go
back
and
how
will
you
prepare
it
i
asked
the
canadian
ill
make
a
fermented
batter
from
its
pulp
thatll
keep
indefinitely
without
spoiling
when
i
want
some
ill
just
cook
it
in
the
galley
on
boarditll
have
a
slightly
tart
flavor
but
youll
find
it
excellent
so
mr
ned
i
see
that
this
bread
is
all
we
need
not
quite
professor
the
canadian
replied
we
need
some
fruit
to
go
with
it
or
at
least
some
vegetables
then
lets
look
for
fruit
and
vegetables
when
our
breadfruit
harvesting
was
done
we
took
to
the
trail
to
complete
this
dryland
dinner
we
didnt
search
in
vain
and
near
noontime
we
had
an
ample
supply
of
bananas
this
delicious
produce
from
the
torrid
zones
ripens
all
year
round
and
malaysians
who
give
them
the
name
pisang
eat
them
without
bothering
to
cook
them
in
addition
to
bananas
we
gathered
some
enormous
jackfruit
with
a
very
tangy
flavor
some
tasty
mangoes
and
some
pineapples
of
unbelievable
size
but
this
foraging
took
up
a
good
deal
of
our
time
which
even
so
we
had
no
cause
to
regret
conseil
kept
ned
under
observation
the
harpooner
walked
in
the
lead
and
during
his
stroll
through
this
forest
he
gathered
with
sure
hands
some
excellent
fruit
that
should
have
completed
his
provisions
so
conseil
asked
you
have
everything
you
need
ned
my
friend
humph
the
canadian
put
in
what
youre
complaining
all
this
vegetation
doesnt
make
a
meal
ned
replied
just
side
dishes
dessert
but
wheres
the
soup
course
wheres
the
roast
right
i
said
ned
promised
us
cutlets
which
seems
highly
questionable
to
me
sir
the
canadian
replied
our
hunting
not
only
isnt
over
it
hasnt
even
started
patience
were
sure
to
end
up
bumping
into
some
animal
with
either
feathers
or
fur
if
not
in
this
locality
then
in
another
and
if
not
today
then
tomorrow
because
we
mustnt
wander
too
far
off
conseil
added
thats
why
i
propose
that
we
return
to
the
skiff
what
already
ned
exclaimed
we
ought
to
be
back
before
nightfall
i
said
but
what
hour
is
it
then
the
canadian
asked
two
oclock
at
least
conseil
replied
how
time
flies
on
solid
ground
exclaimed
mr
ned
land
with
a
sigh
of
regret
off
we
go
conseil
replied
so
we
returned
through
the
forest
and
we
completed
our
harvest
by
making
a
clean
sweep
of
some
palm
cabbages
that
had
to
be
picked
from
the
crowns
of
their
trees
some
small
beans
that
i
recognized
as
the
abrou
of
the
malaysians
and
some
highquality
yams
we
were
overloaded
when
we
arrived
at
the
skiff
however
ned
land
still
found
these
provisions
inadequate
but
fortune
smiled
on
him
just
as
we
were
boarding
he
spotted
several
trees
twentyfive
to
thirty
feet
high
belonging
to
the
palm
species
as
valuable
as
the
artocarpus
these
trees
are
justly
ranked
among
the
most
useful
produce
in
malaysia
they
were
sago
palms
vegetation
that
grows
without
being
cultivated
like
mulberry
trees
they
reproduce
by
means
of
shoots
and
seeds
ned
land
knew
how
to
handle
these
trees
taking
his
ax
and
wielding
it
with
great
vigor
he
soon
stretched
out
on
the
ground
two
or
three
sago
palms
whose
maturity
was
revealed
by
the
white
dust
sprinkled
over
their
palm
fronds
i
watched
him
more
as
a
naturalist
than
as
a
man
in
hunger
he
began
by
removing
from
each
trunk
an
inchthick
strip
of
bark
that
covered
a
network
of
long
hopelessly
tangled
fibers
that
were
puttied
with
a
sort
of
gummy
flour
this
flour
was
the
starchlike
sago
an
edible
substance
chiefly
consumed
by
the
melanesian
peoples
for
the
time
being
ned
land
was
content
to
chop
these
trunks
into
pieces
as
if
he
were
making
firewood
later
he
would
extract
the
flour
by
sifting
it
through
cloth
to
separate
it
from
its
fibrous
ligaments
let
it
dry
out
in
the
sun
and
leave
it
to
harden
inside
molds
finally
at
five
oclock
in
the
afternoon
laden
with
all
our
treasures
we
left
the
island
beach
and
half
an
hour
later
pulled
alongside
the
nautilus
nobody
appeared
on
our
arrival
the
enormous
sheetiron
cylinder
seemed
deserted
our
provisions
loaded
on
board
i
went
below
to
my
stateroom
there
i
found
my
supper
ready
i
ate
and
then
fell
asleep
the
next
day
january
6
nothing
new
on
board
not
a
sound
inside
not
a
sign
of
life
the
skiff
stayed
alongside
in
the
same
place
we
had
left
it
we
decided
to
return
to
gueboroa
island
ned
land
hoped
for
better
luck
in
his
hunting
than
on
the
day
before
and
he
wanted
to
visit
a
different
part
of
the
forest
by
sunrise
we
were
off
carried
by
an
inbound
current
the
longboat
reached
the
island
in
a
matter
of
moments
we
disembarked
and
thinking
it
best
to
abide
by
the
canadians
instincts
we
followed
ned
land
whose
long
legs
threatened
to
outpace
us
ned
land
went
westward
up
the
coast
then
fording
some
stream
beds
he
reached
open
plains
that
were
bordered
by
wonderful
forests
some
kingfishers
lurked
along
the
watercourses
but
they
didnt
let
us
approach
their
cautious
behavior
proved
to
me
that
these
winged
creatures
knew
where
they
stood
on
bipeds
of
our
species
and
i
concluded
that
if
this
island
wasnt
inhabited
at
least
human
beings
paid
it
frequent
visits
after
crossing
a
pretty
lush
prairie
we
arrived
on
the
outskirts
of
a
small
wood
enlivened
by
the
singing
and
soaring
of
a
large
number
of
birds
still
theyre
merely
birds
conseil
said
but
some
are
edible
the
harpooner
replied
wrong
ned
my
friend
conseil
answered
because
i
see
only
ordinary
parrots
here
conseil
my
friend
ned
replied
in
all
seriousness
parrots
are
like
pheasant
to
people
with
nothing
else
on
their
plates
and
i
might
add
i
said
that
when
these
birds
are
properly
cooked
theyre
at
least
worth
a
stab
of
the
fork
indeed
under
the
dense
foliage
of
this
wood
a
whole
host
of
parrots
fluttered
from
branch
to
branch
needing
only
the
proper
upbringing
to
speak
human
dialects
at
present
they
were
cackling
in
chorus
with
parakeets
of
every
color
with
solemn
cockatoos
that
seemed
to
be
pondering
some
philosophical
problem
while
bright
red
lories
passed
by
like
pieces
of
bunting
borne
on
the
breeze
in
the
midst
of
kalao
parrots
raucously
on
the
wing
papuan
lories
painted
the
subtlest
shades
of
azure
and
a
whole
variety
of
delightful
winged
creatures
none
terribly
edible
however
one
bird
unique
to
these
shores
which
never
passes
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
aru
and
papuan
islands
was
missing
from
this
collection
but
i
was
given
a
chance
to
marvel
at
it
soon
enough
after
crossing
through
a
moderately
dense
thicket
we
again
found
some
plains
obstructed
by
bushes
there
i
saw
some
magnificent
birds
soaring
aloft
the
arrangement
of
their
long
feathers
causing
them
to
head
into
the
wind
their
undulating
flight
the
grace
of
their
aerial
curves
and
the
play
of
their
colors
allured
and
delighted
the
eye
i
had
no
trouble
identifying
them

malaysians
who
do
a
booming
business
in
these
birds
with
the
chinese
have
various
methods
for
catching
them
that
we
couldnt
use
sometimes
they
set
snares
on
the
tops
of
the
tall
trees
that
the
bird
of
paradise
prefers
to
inhabit
at
other
times
they
capture
it
with
a
tenacious
glue
that
paralyzes
its
movements
they
will
even
go
so
far
as
to
poison
the
springs
where
these
fowl
habitually
drink
but
in
our
case
all
we
could
do
was
fire
at
them
on
the
wing
which
left
us
little
chance
of
getting
one
and
in
truth
we
used
up
a
good
part
of
our
ammunition
in
vain
near
eleven
oclock
in
the
morning
we
cleared
the

we
still
hadnt

the
hunters

counted
on
consuming
the

off

insured
our

he
brought
down
a
white
pigeon
and
a

which
were
briskly
plucked
hung
from
a
spit
and
roasted
over
a
blazing
fire
of
deadwood
while
these
fascinating
animals
were
cooking
ned
prepared
some

the

declared
excellent

these

all
these
pigeons
are
only
appetizers
snacks
so
till
ive
bagged
an
animal
with
cutlets
i
wont
be
happy
nor
i
ned
until
ive
caught
a
bird

then
lets
keep
hunting
conseil
replied
but
while
heading
back
to
the
sea
weve
arrived
at
the
foothills
of
these
mountains
and
i
think
well
do
better
if
we
return
to
the
forest
regions
it
was
good
advice
and
we
took
it
after
an
hours
walk
we
reached
a
genuine
sago
palm
forest
a
few
harmless
snakes
fled
underfoot
birds
of
paradise
stole
off
at
our
approach
and
i
was
in
real
despair
of
catching
one
when
conseil
walking
in
the
lead
stooped
suddenly
gave
a
triumphant
shout
and
came
back
to
me
carrying
a
magnificent
bird
of
paradise
oh
bravo
conseil
i
exclaimed
master
is
too
kind
conseil
replied
not
at
all
my
boy
that
was
a
stroke
of
genius
catching
one
of
these
live
birds
with
your
bare
hands
if
master
will
examine
it
closely
hell
see
that
i
deserve
no
great
praise
and
why
not
conseil
because
this
bird
is
as
drunk
as
a
lord
drunk
yes
master
drunk
from
the
nutmegs
it
was
devouring
under
that
nutmeg
tree
where
i
caught
it
see
ned
my
friend
see
the
monstrous
results
of
intemperance
damnation
the
canadian
shot
back
considering
the
amount
of
gin
ive
had
these
past
two
months
youve
got
nothing
to
complain
about
meanwhile
i
was
examining
this
unusual
bird
conseil
was
not
mistaken
tipsy
from
that
potent
juice
our
bird
of
paradise
had
been
reduced
to
helplessness
it
was
unable
to
fly
it
was
barely
able
to
walk
but
this
didnt
alarm
me
and
i
just
let
it
sleep
off
its
nutmeg
this
bird
belonged
to
the
finest
of
the
eight
species
credited
to
papua
and
its
neighboring
islands
it
was
a
great
emerald
one
of
the
rarest
birds
of
paradise
it
measured
three
decimeters
long
its
head
was
comparatively
small
and
its
eyes
placed
near
the
opening
of
its
beak
were
also
small
but
it
offered
a
wonderful
mixture
of
hues
a
yellow
beak
brown
feet
and
claws
hazel
wings
with
purple
tips
pale
yellow
head
and
scruff
of
the
neck
emerald
throat
the
belly
and
chest
maroon
to
brown
two
strands
made
of
a
horn
substance
covered
with
down
rose
over
its
tail
which
was
lengthened
by
long
very
light
feathers
of
wonderful
fineness
and
they
completed
the
costume
of
this
marvelous
bird
that
the
islanders
have
poetically
named
the
sun
bird
how
i
wished
i
could
take
this
superb
bird
of
paradise
back
to
paris
to
make
a
gift
of
it
to
the
zoo
at
the
botanical
gardens
which
doesnt
own
a
single
live
specimen
so
it
must
be
a
rarity
or
something
the
canadian
asked
in
the
tone
of
a
hunter
who
from
the
viewpoint
of
his
art
gives
the
game
a
pretty
low
rating
a
great
rarity
my
gallant
comrade
and
above
all
very
hard
to
capture
alive
and
even
after
theyre
dead
theres
still
a
major
market
for
these
birds
so
the
natives
have
figured
out
how
to
create
fake
ones
like
people
create
fake
pearls
or
diamonds
what
conseil
exclaimed
they
make
counterfeit
birds
of
paradise
yes
conseil
and
is
master
familiar
with
how
the
islanders
go
about
it
perfectly
familiar
during
the
easterly
monsoon
season
birds
of
paradise
lose
the
magnificent
feathers
around
their
tails
that
naturalists
call
belowthewing
feathers
these
feathers
are
gathered
by
the
fowl
forgers
and
skillfully
fitted
onto
some
poor
previously
mutilated
parakeet
then
they
paint
over
the
suture
varnish
the
bird
and
ship
the
fruits
of
their
unique
labors
to
museums
and
collectors
in
europe
good
enough
ned
land
put
in
if
it
isnt
the
right
bird
its
still
the
right
feathers
and
so
long
as
the
merchandise
isnt
meant
to
be
eaten
i
see
no
great
harm
but
if
my
desires
were
fulfilled
by
the
capture
of
this
bird
of
paradise
those
of
our
canadian
huntsman
remained
unsatisfied
luckily
near
two
oclock
ned
land
brought
down
a
magnificent
wild
pig
of
the
type
the
natives
call
barioutang
this
animal
came
in
the
nick
of
time
for
us
to
bag
some
real
quadruped
meat
and
it
was
warmly
welcomed
ned
land
proved
himself
quite
gloriously
with
his
gunshot
hit
by
an
electric
bullet
the
pig
dropped
dead
on
the
spot
the
canadian
properly
skinned
and
cleaned
it
after
removing
half
a
dozen
cutlets
destined
to
serve
as
the
grilled
meat
course
of
our
evening
meal
then
the
hunt
was
on
again
and
once
more
would
be
marked
by
the
exploits
of
ned
and
conseil
in
essence
beating
the
bushes
the
two
friends
flushed
a
herd
of
kangaroos
that
fled
by
bounding
away
on
their
elastic
paws
but
these
animals
didnt
flee
so
swiftly
that
our
electric
capsules
couldnt
catch
up
with
them
oh
professor
shouted
ned
land
whose
hunting
fever
had
gone
to
his
brain
what
excellent
game
especially
in
a
stew
what
a
supply
for
the
nautilus
two
three
five
down
and
just
think
how
well
devour
all
this
meat
ourselves
while
those
numbskulls
on
board
wont
get
a
shred
in
his
uncontrollable
glee
i
think
the
canadian
might
have
slaughtered
the
whole
horde
if
he
hadnt
been
so
busy
talking
but
he
was
content
with
a
dozen
of
these
fascinating
marsupials
which
make
up
the
first
order
of
aplacental
mammals
as
conseil
just
had
to
tell
us
these
animals
were
small
in
stature
they
were
a
species
of
those
rabbit
kangaroos
that
usually
dwell
in
the
hollows
of
trees
and
are
tremendously
fast
but
although
of
moderate
dimensions
they
at
least
furnish
a
meat
thats
highly
prized
we
were
thoroughly
satisfied
with
the
results
of
our
hunting
a
gleeful
ned
proposed
that
we
return
the
next
day
to
this
magic
island
which
he
planned
to
depopulate
of
its
every
edible
quadruped
but
he
was
reckoning
without
events
by
six
oclock
in
the
evening
we
were
back
on
the
beach
the
skiff
was
aground
in
its
usual
place
the
nautilus
looking
like
a
long
reef
emerged
from
the
waves
two
miles
offshore
without
further
ado
ned
land
got
down
to
the
important

came
wonderfully
to
terms
with
its
entire
cooking
grilling
over
the
coals
those
cutlets
from
the
barioutang
soon
gave
off
a
succulent

perfumed
the

but
i

beat
a
retreat
because
some
twenty
natives
armed
with
bows
and
slings
appeared
barely
a
hundred
paces
off
on
the
outskirts
of
a
thicket
that
masked
the
horizon
to
our
right
the
skiff
was
aground
ten
fathoms
away
from
us
the
savages
approached
without
running
but
they
favored
us
with
a
show
of
the
greatest
hostility
it
was
raining
stones
and
arrows
ned
land
was
unwilling
to
leave
his
provisions
behind
and
despite
the
impending
danger
he
clutched
his
pig
on
one
side
his
kangaroos
on
the
other
and
scampered
off
with
respectable
speed
in
two
minutes
we
were
on
the
strand
loading
provisions
and
weapons
into
the
skiff
pushing
it
to
sea
and
positioning
its
two
oars
were
the
work
of
an
instant
we
hadnt
gone
two
cable
lengths
when
a
hundred
savages
howling
and
gesticulating
entered
the
water
up
to
their
waists
i
looked
to
see
if
their
appearance
might
draw
some
of
the
nautiluss
men
onto
the
platform
but
no
lying
well
out
that
enormous
machine
still
seemed
completely
deserted
twenty
minutes
later
we
boarded
ship
the
hatches
were
open
after
mooring
the
skiff
we
reentered
the
nautiluss
interior
i
went
below
to
the
lounge
from
which
some
chords
were
wafting
captain
nemo
was
there
leaning
over
the
organ
deep
in
a
musical
trance
captain
i
said
to
him
he
didnt
hear
me
captain
i
went
on
touching
him
with
my
hand
he
trembled
and
turning
around
ah
its
you
professor
he
said
to
me
well
did
you
have
a
happy
hunt
was
your
herb
gathering
a
success
yes
captain
i
replied
but
unfortunately
weve
brought
back
a
horde
of
bipeds
whose
proximity
worries
me
what
sort
of
bipeds
savages
savages
captain
nemo
replied
in
an
ironic
tone
you
set
foot
on
one
of
the
shores
of
this
globe
professor
and
youre
surprised
to
find
savages
there
where
arent
there
savages
and
besides
are
they
any
worse
than
men
elsewhere
these
people
you
call
savages
but
captain
speaking
for
myself
sir
ive
encountered
them
everywhere
well
then
i
replied
if
you
dont
want
to
welcome
them
aboard
the
nautilus
youd
better
take
some
precautions
easy
professor
no
cause
for
alarm
but
there
are
a
large
number
of
these
natives
whats
your
count
at
least
a
hundred
professor
aronnax
replied
captain
nemo
whose
fingers
took
their
places
again
on
the
organ
keys
if
every
islander
in
papua
were
to
gather
on
that
beach
the
nautilus
would
still
have
nothing
to
fear
from
their
attacks
the
captains
fingers
then
ran
over
the
instruments
keyboard
and
i
noticed
that
he
touched
only
its
black
keys
which
gave
his
melodies
a
basically
scottish
color
soon
he
had
forgotten
my
presence
and
was
lost
in
a
reverie
that
i
no
longer
tried
to
dispel
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
night
had
already
fallen
because
in
this
low
latitude
the
sun
sets
quickly
without
any
twilight
i
could
see
gueboroa
island
only
dimly
but
numerous
fires
had
been
kindled
on
the
beach
attesting
that
the
natives
had
no
thoughts
of
leaving
it
for
several
hours
i
was
left
to
myself
sometimes
musing
on
the
islandersbut
no
longer
fearing
them
because
the
captains
unflappable
confidence
had
won
me
overand
sometimes
forgetting
them
to
marvel
at
the
splendors
of
this
tropical
night
my
memories
took
wing
toward
france
in
the
wake
of
those
zodiacal
stars
due
to
twinkle
over
it
in
a
few
hours
the
moon
shone
in
the
midst
of
the
constellations
at
their
zenith
i
then
remembered
that
this
loyal
goodnatured
satellite
would
return
to
this
same
place
the
day
after
tomorrow
to
raise
the
tide
and
tear
the
nautilus
from
its
coral
bed
near
midnight
seeing
that
all
was
quiet
over
the
darkened
waves
as
well
as
under
the
waterside
trees
i
repaired
to
my
cabin
and
fell
into
a
peaceful
sleep
the
night
passed
without
mishap
no
doubt
the
papuans
had
been
frightened
off
by
the
mere
sight
of
this
monster
aground
in
the
bay
because
our
hatches
stayed
open
offering
easy
access
to
the
nautiluss
interior
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
january
8
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
the
morning
shadows
were
lifting
the
island
was
soon
on
view
through
the
dissolving
mists
first
its
beaches
then
its
summits
the
islanders
were
still
there
in
greater
numbers
than
on
the
day
before
perhaps
500
or
600
of
them
taking
advantage
of
the
low
tide
some
of
them
had
moved
forward
over
the
heads
of
coral
to
within
two
cable
lengths
of
the
nautilus
i
could
easily
distinguish
them
they
obviously
were
true
papuans
men
of
fine
stock
athletic
in
build
forehead
high
and
broad
nose
large
but
not
flat
teeth
white
their
woolly
redtinted
hair
was
in
sharp
contrast
to
their
bodies
which
were
black
and
glistening
like
those
of
nubians
beneath
their
pierced
distended
earlobes
there
dangled
strings
of
beads
made
from
bone
generally
these
savages
were
naked
i
noted
some
women
among
them
dressed
from
hip
to
knee
in
grass
skirts
held
up
by
belts
made
of
vegetation
some
of
the
chieftains
adorned
their
necks
with
crescents
and
with
necklaces
made
from
beads
of
red
and
white
glass
armed
with
bows
arrows
and
shields
nearly
all
of
them
carried
from
their
shoulders
a
sort
of
net
which
held
those
polished
stones
their
slings
hurl
with
such
dexterity
one
of
these
chieftains
came
fairly
close
to
the
nautilus
examining
it
with
care
he
must
have
been
a
mado
of
high
rank
because
he
paraded
in
a
mat
of
banana
leaves
that
had
ragged
edges
and
was
accented
with
bright
colors
i
could
easily
have
picked
off
this
islander
he
stood
at
such
close
range
but
i
thought
it
best
to
wait
for
an
actual
show
of
hostility
between
europeans
and
savages
its
acceptable
for
europeans
to
shoot
back
but
not
to
attack
first
during
this
whole
time
of
low
tide
the
islanders
lurked
near
the
nautilus
but
they
werent
boisterous
i
often
heard
them
repeat
the
word
assai
and
from
their
gestures
i
understood
they
were
inviting
me
to
go
ashore
an
invitation
i
felt
obliged
to
decline
so
the
skiff
didnt
leave
shipside
that
day
much
to
the
displeasure
of
mr
land
who
couldnt
complete
his
provisions
the
adroit
canadian
spent
his
time
preparing
the
meat
and
flour
products
he
had
brought
from
gueboroa
island
as
for
the
savages
they
went
back
to
shore
near
eleven
oclock
in
the
morning
when
the
heads
of
coral
began
to
disappear
under
the
waves
of
the
rising
tide
but
i
saw
their
numbers
swell
considerably
on
the
beach
it
was
likely
that
they
had
come
from
neighboring
islands
or
from
the
mainland
of
papua
proper
however
i
didnt
see
one
local
dugout
canoe
having
nothing
better
to
do
i
decided
to
dredge
these
beautiful
clear
waters
which
exhibited
a
profusion
of
shells
zoophytes
and
opensea
plants
besides
it
was
the
last
day
the
nautilus
would
spend
in
these
waterways
if
tomorrow
it
still
floated
off
to
the
open
sea
as
captain
nemo
had
promised
so
i
summoned
conseil
who
brought
me
a
small
light
dragnet
similar
to
those
used
in
oyster
fishing
what
about
these
savages
conseil
asked
me
with
all
due
respect
to
master
they
dont
strike
me
as
very
wicked
theyre
cannibals
even
so
my
boy
a
person
can
be
both
a
cannibal
and
a
decent
man
conseil
replied
just
as
a
person
can
be
both
gluttonous
and
honorable
the
one
doesnt
exclude
the
other
fine
conseil
and
i
agree
that
there
are
honorable
cannibals
who
decently
devour
their
prisoners
however
im
opposed
to
being
devoured
even
in
all
decency
so
ill
keep
on
my
guard
especially
since
the
nautiluss
commander
seems
to
be
taking
no
precautions
and
now
lets
get
to
work
for
two
hours
our
fishing
proceeded
energetically
but
without
bringing
up
any
rarities
our
dragnet
was
filled
with
midas
abalone
harp
shells
obelisk
snails
and
especially
the
finest
hammer
shells
i
had
seen
to
that
day
we
also
gathered
in
a
few
sea
cucumbers
some
pearl
oysters
and
a
dozen
small
turtles
that
we
saved
for
the
ships
pantry
but
just
when
i
least
expected
it
i
laid
my
hands
on
a
wonder
a
natural
deformity
id
have
to
call
it
something
very
seldom
encountered
conseil
had
just
made
a
cast
of
the
dragnet
and
his
gear
had
come
back
up
loaded
with
a
variety
of
fairly
ordinary
seashells
when
suddenly
he
saw
me
plunge
my
arms
swiftly
into
the
net
pull
out
a
shelled
animal
and
give
a
conchological
yell
in
other
words
the
most
piercing
yell
a
human
throat
can
produce
eh
what
happened
to
master
conseil
asked
very
startled
did
master
get
bitten
no
my
boy
but
id
gladly
have
sacrificed
a
finger
for
such
a
find
what
find
this
shell
i
said
displaying
the
subject
of
my
triumph
but
thats
simply
an
olive
shell
of
the
tent
olive
species
genus
oliva
order
pectinibranchia
class
gastropoda
branch
mollusca
yes
yes
conseil
but
instead
of
coiling
from
right
to
left
this
olive
shell
rolls
from
left
to
right
it
cant
be
conseil
exclaimed
yes
my
boy
its
a
lefthanded
shell
a
lefthanded
shell
conseil
repeated
his
heart
pounding
look
at
its
spiral
oh
master
can
trust
me
on
this
conseil
said
taking
the
valuable
shell
in
trembling
hands
but
never
have
i
felt
such
excitement
and
there
was
good
reason
to
be
excited
in
fact
as
naturalists
have
ventured
to
observe
dextrality
is
a
wellknown
law
of
nature
in
their
rotational
and
orbital
movements
stars
and
their
satellites
go
from
right
to
left
man
uses
his
right
hand
more
often
than
his
left
and
consequently
his
various
instruments
and
equipment
staircases
locks
watch
springs
etc
are
designed
to
be
used
in
a
righttoleft
manner
now
then
nature
has
generally
obeyed
this
law
in
coiling
her
shells
theyre
righthanded
with
only
rare
exceptions
and
when
by
chance
a
shells
spiral
is
lefthanded
collectors
will
pay
its
weight
in
gold
for
it
so
conseil
and
i
were
deep
in
the
contemplation
of
our
treasure
and
i
was
solemnly
promising
myself
to
enrich
the
paris
museum
with
it
when
an
illtimed
stone
hurled
by
one
of
the
islanders
whizzed
over
and
shattered
the
valuable
object
in
conseils
hands
i
gave
a
yell
of
despair
conseil
pounced
on
his
rifle
and
aimed
at
a
savage
swinging
a
sling
just
ten
meters
away
from
him
i
tried
to
stop
him
but
his
shot
went
off
and
shattered
a
bracelet
of
amulets
dangling
from
the
islanders
arm
conseil
i
shouted
conseil
eh
what
didnt
master
see
that
this
maneater
initiated
the
attack
a
shell
isnt
worth
a
human
life
i
told
him
oh
the
rascal
conseil
exclaimed
id
rather
he
cracked
my
shoulder
conseil
was
in
dead
earnest
but
i
didnt
subscribe
to
his
views
however
the
situation
had
changed
in
only
a
short
time
and
we
hadnt
noticed
now
some
twenty
dugout
canoes
were
surrounding
the
nautilus
hollowed
from
tree
trunks
these
dugouts
were
long
narrow
and
well
designed
for
speed
keeping
their
balance
by
means
of
two
bamboo
poles
that
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
water
they
were
maneuvered
by
skillful
halfnaked
paddlers
and
i
viewed
their
advance
with
definite
alarm
it
was
obvious
these
papuans
had
already
entered
into
relations
with
europeans
and
knew
their
ships
but
this
long
iron
cylinder
lying
in
the
bay
with
no
masts
or
funnelswhat
were
they
to
make
of
it
nothing
good
because
at
first
they
kept
it
at
a
respectful
distance
however
seeing
that
it
stayed
motionless
they
regained
confidence
little
by
little
and
tried
to
become
more
familiar
with
it
now
then
it
was
precisely
this
familiarity
that
we
needed
to
prevent
since
our
weapons
made
no
sound
when
they
went
off
they
would
have
only
a
moderate
effect
on
these
islanders
who
reputedly
respect
nothing
but
noisy
mechanisms
without
thunderclaps
lightning
bolts
would
be
much
less
frightening
although
the
danger
lies
in
the
flash
not
the
noise
just
then
the
dugout
canoes
drew
nearer
to
the
nautilus
and
a
cloud
of
arrows
burst
over
us
fire
and
brimstone
its
hailing
conseil
said
and
poisoned
hail
perhaps
weve
got
to
alert
captain
nemo
i
said
reentering
the
hatch
i
went
below
to
the
lounge
i
found
no
one
there
i
ventured
a
knock
at
the
door
opening
into
the
captains
stateroom
the
word
enter
answered
me
i
did
so
and
found
captain
nemo
busy
with
calculations
in
which
there
was
no
shortage
of
x
and
other
algebraic
signs
am
i
disturbing
you
i
said
out
of
politeness
correct
professor
aronnax
the
captain
answered
me
but
i
imagine
you
have
pressing
reasons
for
looking
me
up
very
pressing
native
dugout
canoes
are
surrounding
us
and
in
a
few
minutes
were
sure
to
be
assaulted
by
several
hundred
savages
ah
captain
nemo
put
in
serenely
theyve
come
in
their
dugouts
yes
sir
well
sir
closing
the
hatches
should
do
the
trick
precisely
and
thats
what
i
came
to
tell
you
nothing
easier
captain
nemo
said
and
he
pressed
an
electric
button
transmitting
an
order
to
the
crews
quarters
there
sir
all
under
control
he
told
me
after
a
few
moments
the
skiff
is
in
place
and
the
hatches
are
closed
i
dont
imagine
youre
worried
that
these
gentlemen
will
stave
in
walls
that
shells
from
your
frigate
couldnt
breach
no
captain
but
one
danger
still
remains
whats
that
sir
tomorrow
at
about
this
time
well
need
to
reopen
the
hatches
to
renew
the
nautiluss
air
no
argument
sir
since
our
craft
breathes
in
the
manner
favored
by
cetaceans
but
if
these
papuans
are
occupying
the
platform
at
that
moment
i
dont
see
how
you
can
prevent
them
from
entering
then
sir
you
assume
theyll
board
the
ship
im
certain
of
it
well
sir
let
them
come
aboard
i
see
no
reason
to
prevent
them
deep
down
theyre
just
poor
devils
these
papuans
and
i
dont
want
my
visit
to
gueboroa
island
to
cost
the
life
of
a
single
one
of
these
unfortunate
people
on
this
note
i
was
about
to
withdraw
but
captain
nemo
detained
me
and
invited
me
to
take
a
seat
next
to
him
he
questioned
me
with
interest
on
our
excursions
ashore
and
on
our
hunting
but
seemed
not
to
understand
the
canadians
passionate
craving
for
red
meat
then
our
conversation
skimmed
various
subjects
and
without
being
more
forthcoming
captain
nemo
proved
more
affable
among
other
things
we
came
to
talk
of
the
nautiluss
circumstances
aground
in
the
same
strait
where
captain
dumont
durville
had
nearly
miscarried
then
pertinent
to
this
he
was
one
of
your
great
seamen
the
captain
told
me
one
of
your
shrewdest
navigators
that
durville
he
was
the
frenchmans
captain
cook
a
man
wise
but
unlucky
braving
the
ice
banks
of
the
south
pole
the
coral
of
oceania
the
cannibals
of
the
pacific
only
to
perish
wretchedly
in
a
train
wreck
if
that
energetic
man
was
able
to
think
about
his
life
in
its
last
seconds
imagine
what
his
final
thoughts
must
have
been
as
he
spoke
captain
nemo
seemed
deeply
moved
an
emotion
i
felt
was
to
his
credit
then
chart
in
hand
we
returned
to
the
deeds
of
the
french
navigator
his
voyages
to
circumnavigate
the
globe
his
double
attempt
at
the
south
pole
which
led
to
his
discovery
of
the
adlie
coast
and
the
louisphilippe
peninsula
finally
his
hydrographic
surveys
of
the
chief
islands
in
oceania
what
your
durville
did
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
captain
nemo
told
me
ive
done
in
the
oceans
interior
but
more
easily
more
completely
than
he
constantly
tossed
about
by
hurricanes
the
zealous
and
the
new
astrolabe
couldnt
compare
with
the
nautilus
a
quiet
work
room
truly
at
rest
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
even
so
captain
i
said
there
is
one
major
similarity
between
dumont
durvilles
sloops
of
war
and
the
nautilus
whats
that
sir
like
them
the
nautilus
has
run
aground
the
nautilus
is
not
aground
sir
captain
nemo
replied
icily
the
nautilus
was
built
to
rest
on
the
ocean
floor
and
i
dont
need
to
undertake
the
arduous
labors
the
maneuvers
durville
had
to
attempt
in
order
to
float
off
his
sloops
of
war
the
zealous
and
the
new
astrolabe
wellnigh
perished
but
my
nautilus
is
in
no
danger
tomorrow
on
the
day
stated
and
at
the
hour
stated
the
tide
will
peacefully
lift
it
off
and
it
will
resume
its
navigating
through
the
seas
captain
i
said
i
dont
doubt
tomorrow
captain
nemo
added
standing
up
tomorrow
at
240
in
the
afternoon
the
nautilus
will
float
off
and
exit
the
torres
strait
undamaged
pronouncing
these
words
in
an
extremely
sharp
tone
captain
nemo
gave
me
a
curt
bow
this
was
my
dismissal
and
i
reentered
my
stateroom
there
i
found
conseil
who
wanted
to
know
the
upshot
of
my
interview
with
the
captain
my
boy
i
replied
when
i
expressed
the
belief
that
these
papuan
natives
were
a
threat
to
his
nautilus
the
captain
answered
me
with
great
irony
so
ive
just
one
thing
to
say
to
you
have
faith
in
him
and
sleep
in
peace
master
has
no
need
for
my
services
no
my
friend
whats
ned
land
up
to
begging
masters
indulgence
conseil
replied
but
our
friend
ned
is
concocting
a
kangaroo
pie
that
will
be
the
eighth
wonder
i
was
left
to
myself
i
went
to
bed
but
slept
pretty
poorly
i
kept
hearing
noises
from
the
savages
who
were
stamping
on
the
platform
and
letting
out
deafening
yells
the
night
passed
in
this
way
without
the
crew
ever
emerging
from
their
usual
inertia
they
were
no
more
disturbed
by
the
presence
of
these
maneaters
than
soldiers
in
an
armored
fortress
are
troubled
by
ants
running
over
the
armor
plate
i
got
up
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
the
hatches
werent
open
so
the
air
inside
hadnt
been
renewed
but
the
air
tanks
were
kept
full
for
any
eventuality
and
would
function
appropriately
to
shoot
a
few
cubic
meters
of
oxygen
into
the
nautiluss
thin
atmosphere
i
worked
in
my
stateroom
until
noon
without
seeing
captain
nemo
even
for
an
instant
nobody
on
board
seemed
to
be
making
any
preparations
for
departure
i
still
waited
for
a
while
then
i
made
my
way
to
the
main
lounge
its
timepiece
marked
230
in
ten
minutes
the
tide
would
reach
its
maximum
elevation
and
if
captain
nemo
hadnt
made
a
rash
promise
the
nautilus
would
immediately
break
free
if
not
many
months
might
pass
before
it
could
leave
its
coral
bed
but
some
preliminary
vibrations
could
soon
be
felt
over
the
boats
hull
i
heard
its
plating
grind
against
the
limestone
roughness
of
that
coral
base
at
235
captain
nemo
appeared
in
the
lounge
were
about
to
depart
he
said
ah
i
put
in
ive
given
orders
to
open
the
hatches
what
about
the
papuans
what
about
them
captain
nemo
replied
with
a
light
shrug
of
his
shoulders
wont
they
come
inside
the
nautilus
how
will
they
manage
that
by
jumping
down
the
hatches
youre
about
to
open
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
replied
serenely
the
nautiluss
hatches
arent
to
be
entered
in
that
fashion
even
when
theyre
open
i
gaped
at
the
captain
you
dont
understand
he
said
to
me
not
in
the
least
well
come
along
and
youll
see
i
headed
to
the
central
companionway
there
very
puzzled
ned
land
and
conseil
watched
the
crewmen
opening
the
hatches
while
a
frightful
clamor
and
furious
shouts
resounded
outside
the
hatch
lids
fell
back
onto
the
outer
plating
twenty
horrible
faces
appeared
but
when
the
first
islander
laid
hands
on
the
companionway
railing
he
was
flung
backward
by
some
invisible
power
lord
knows
what
he
ran
off
howling
in
terror
and
wildly
prancing
around
ten
of
his
companions
followed
him
all
ten
met
the
same
fate
conseil
was
in
ecstasy
carried
away
by
his
violent
instincts
ned
land
leaped
up
the
companionway
but
as
soon
as
his
hands
seized
the
railing
he
was
thrown
backward
in
his
turn
damnation
he
exclaimed
ive
been
struck
by
a
lightning
bolt
these
words
explained
everything
to
me
it
wasnt
just
a
railing
that
led
to
the
platform
it
was
a
metal
cable
fully
charged
with
the

anyone
who
touched
it
got
a
fearsome
shockand
such
a
shock
would
have
been
fatal
if
captain
nemo
had
thrown
the
full
current
from
his
equipment
into
this
conducting
cable
it
could
honestly
be
said
that
he
had
stretched
between
himself
and
his
assailants
a
network
of
electricity
no
one
could
clear
with
impunity
meanwhile
crazed
with
terror
the
unhinged
papuans
beat
a
retreat
as
for
us
half
laughing
we
massaged
and
comforted
poor
ned
land
who
was
swearing
like
one
possessed
but
just
then
lifted
off
by
the
tides
final
undulations
the
nautilus
left
its
coral
bed
at
exactly
that
fortieth
minute
pinpointed
by
the
captain
its
propeller
churned
the

with
lazy
majesty
gathering

the

on

the
nautilus
resumed
its
travels
in
midwater
but
at
a
remarkable
speed
that
i
estimated
to
be
at
least
thirtyfive
miles
per
hour
the
propeller
was
going
so
fast
i
could
neither
follow
nor
count
its
revolutions
i
thought
about
how
this
marvelous
electric
force
not
only
gave
motion
heat
and
light
to
the
nautilus
but
even
protected
it
against

attack
transforming
it
into
a
sacred
ark
no

could
touch
without
being

my
wonderment
was

the
midst
of
the
waters
sometimes
drifted
on
their
surface
during
this
phase
of
our
voyage
captain
nemo
conducted
interesting
experiments
on
the
different
temperatures
in
various
strata
of
the
sea
under
ordinary
conditions
such
readings
are
obtained
using
some
pretty
complicated
instruments
whose
findings
are
dubious
to
say
the
least
whether
theyre
thermometric
sounding
lines
whose
glass
often
shatters
under
the
waters
pressure
or
those
devices
based
on
the
varying
resistance
of
metals
to
electric
currents
the
results
so
obtained
cant
be
adequately
doublechecked
by
contrast
captain
nemo
would
seek
the
seas
temperature
by
going
himself
into
its
depths
and
when
he
placed
his
thermometer
in
contact
with
the
various
layers
of
liquid
he
found
the
soughtfor
degree
immediately
and
with
certainty
and
so
by
loading
up
its
ballast
tanks
or
by
sinking
obliquely
with
its
slanting
fins
the
nautilus
successively
reached
depths
of
3000
4000
5000
7000
9000
and
10000
meters
and
the
ultimate
conclusion
from
these
experiments
was
that
in
all
latitudes
the
sea
had
a
permanent
temperature
of
45
degrees
centigrade
at
a
depth
of
1000
meters
i
watched
these
experiments
with
the
most
intense
fascination
captain
nemo
brought
a
real
passion
to
them
i
often
wondered
why
he
took
these
observations
were
they
for
the
benefit
of
his
fellow
man
it
was
unlikely
because
sooner
or
later
his
work
would
perish
with
him
in
some
unknown
sea
unless
he
intended
the
results
of
his
experiments
for
me
but
that
meant
this
strange
voyage
of
mine
would
come
to
an
end
and
no
such
end
was
in
sight
be
that
as
it
may
captain
nemo
also
introduced
me
to
the
different
data
he
had
obtained
on
the
relative
densities
of
the
water
in
our
globes
chief
seas
from
this
news
i
derived
some
personal
enlightenment
having
nothing
to
do
with
science
it
happened
the
morning
of
january
15
the
captain
with
whom
i
was
strolling
on
the
platform
asked
me
if
i
knew
how
salt
water
differs
in
density
from
sea
to
sea
i
said
no
adding
that
there
was
a
lack
of
rigorous
scientific
observations
on
this
subject
ive
taken
such
observations
he
told
me
and
i
can
vouch
for
their
reliability
fine
i
replied
but
the
nautilus
lives
in
a
separate
world
and
the
secrets
of
its
scientists
dont
make
their
way
ashore
youre
right
professor
he
told
me
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
this
is
a
separate
world
its
as
alien
to
the
earth
as
the
planets
accompanying
our
globe
around
the
sun
and
well
never
become
familiar
with
the
work
of
scientists
on
saturn
or
jupiter
but
since
fate
has
linked
our
two
lives
i
can
reveal
the
results
of
my
observations
to
you
im
all
attention
captain
youre
aware
professor
that
salt
water
is
denser
than
fresh
water
but
this
density
isnt
uniform
in
essence
if
i
represent
the
density
of
fresh
water
by
1000
then
i
find
1028
for
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
1026
for
the
waters
of
the
pacific
1030
for
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
aha
i
thought
so
he
ventures
into
the
mediterranean
1018
for
the
waters
of
the
ionian
sea
and
1029
for
the
waters
of
the
adriatic
assuredly
the
nautilus
didnt
avoid
the
heavily
traveled
seas
of
europe
and
from
this
insight
i
concluded
that
the
ship
would
take
us
backperhaps
very
soonto
more
civilized
shores
i
expected
ned
land
to
greet
this
news
with
unfeigned
satisfaction
for
several
days
our
work
hours
were
spent
in
all
sorts
of
experiments
on
the
degree
of
salinity
in
waters
of
different
depths
or
on
their
electric
properties
coloration
and
transparency
and
in
every
instance
captain
nemo
displayed
an
ingenuity
equaled
only
by
his
graciousness
toward
me
then
i
saw
no
more
of
him
for
some
days
and
again
lived
on
board
in
seclusion
on
january
16
the
nautilus
seemed
to
have
fallen
asleep
just
a
few
meters
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
its
electric
equipment
had
been
turned
off
and
the
motionless
propeller
let
it
ride
with
the
waves
i
assumed
that
the
crew
were
busy
with
interior
repairs
required
by
the
engines
strenuous
mechanical
action
my
companions
and
i
then
witnessed
an
unusual
sight
the
panels
in
the
lounge
were
open
and
since
the
nautiluss
beacon
was
off
a
hazy
darkness
reigned
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
covered
with
heavy
clouds
the
stormy
sky
gave
only
the
faintest
light
to
the
oceans
upper
strata
i
was
observing
the
state
of
the
sea
under
these
conditions
and
even
the
largest
fish
were
nothing
more
than
illdefined
shadows
when
the
nautilus
was
suddenly
transferred
into
broad
daylight
at
first
i
thought
the
beacon
had
gone
back
on
and
was
casting
its
electric
light
into
the
liquid
mass
i
was
mistaken
and
after
a
hasty
examination
i
discovered
my
error
the
nautilus
had
drifted
into
the
midst
of
some
phosphorescent
strata
which
in
this
darkness
came
off
as
positively
dazzling
this
effect
was
caused
by
myriads
of
tiny
luminous
animals
whose
brightness
increased
when
they
glided
over
the
metal
hull
of
our
submersible
in
the
midst
of
these
luminous
sheets
of
water
i
then
glimpsed
flashes
of
light
like
those
seen
inside
a
blazing
furnace
from
streams
of
molten
lead
or
from
masses
of
metal
brought
to
a
white
heatflashes
so
intense
that
certain
areas
of
the
light
became
shadows
by
comparison
in
a
fiery
setting
from
which
every
shadow
should
seemingly
have
been
banished
no
this
was
no
longer
the
calm
emission
of
our
usual
lighting
this
light
throbbed
with
unprecedented
vigor
and
activity
you
sensed
that
it
was
alive
in
essence
it
was
a
cluster
of
countless
opensea
infusoria
of
noctiluca
an
eighth
of
an
inch
wide
actual
globules
of
transparent
jelly
equipped
with
a
threadlike
tentacle
up
to
25000
of
which
have
been
counted
in
thirty
cubic
centimeters
of
water
and
the
power
of
their
light
was
increased
by
those
glimmers
unique
to
medusas
starfish
common
jellyfish
angelwing
clams
and
other
phosphorescent
zoophytes
which
were
saturated
with
grease
from
organic
matter
decomposed
by
the
sea
and
perhaps
with
mucus
secreted
by
fish
for
several
hours
the
nautilus
drifted
in
this
brilliant
tide
and
our
wonderment
grew
when
we
saw
huge
marine
animals
cavorting
in
it
like
the
firedwelling
salamanders
of
myth
in
the
midst
of
these
flames
that
didnt
burn
i
could
see
swift
elegant
porpoises
the
tireless
pranksters
of
the
seas
and
sailfish
three
meters
long
those
shrewd
heralds
of
hurricanes
whose
fearsome
broadswords
sometimes
banged
against
the
lounge
window
then
smaller
fish
appeared
miscellaneous
triggerfish
leather
jacks
unicornfish
and
a
hundred
others
that
left
stripes
on
this
luminous
atmosphere
in
their
course
some
magic
lay
behind
this
dazzling
sight
perhaps
some
atmospheric
condition
had
intensified
this
phenomenon
perhaps
a
storm
had
been
unleashed
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
but
only
a
few
meters
down
the
nautilus
felt
no
tempests
fury
and
the
ship
rocked
peacefully
in
the
midst
of
the
calm
waters
and
so
it
went
some
new
wonder
constantly
delighting
us
conseil
observed
and
classified
his
zoophytes
articulates
mollusks
and
fish
the
days
passed
quickly
and
i
no
longer
kept
track
of
them
ned
as
usual
kept
looking
for
changes
of
pace
from
our
standard
fare
like
actual
snails
we
were
at
home
in
our
shell
and
i
can
vouch
that
its
easy
to
turn
into
a
fullfledged
snail
so
this
way
of
living
began
to
seem
simple
and
natural
to
us
and
we
no
longer
envisioned
a
different
lifestyle
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
earth
when
something
happened
to
remind
us
of
our
strange
circumstances
on
january
18
the
nautilus
lay
in
longitude
105
degrees
and
latitude
15
degrees
south
the
weather
was
threatening
the
sea
rough
and
billowy
the
wind
was
blowing
a
strong
gust
from
the
east
the
barometer
which
had
been
falling
for
some
days
forecast
an
approaching
struggle
of
the
elements
i
had
climbed
onto
the
platform
just
as
the
chief
officer
was
taking
his
readings
of
hour
angles
out
of
habit
i
waited
for
him
to
pronounce
his
daily
phrase
but
that
day
it
was
replaced
by
a
different
phrase
just
as
incomprehensible
almost
at
once
i
saw
captain
nemo
appear
lift
his
spyglass
and
inspect
the
horizon
for
some
minutes
the
captain
stood
motionless
rooted
to
the
spot
contained
within
the
field
of
his
lens
then
he
lowered
his
spyglass
and
exchanged
about
ten
words
with
his
chief
officer
the
latter
seemed
to
be
in
the
grip
of
an
excitement
he
tried
in
vain
to
control
more
in
command
of
himself
captain
nemo
remained
cool
furthermore
he
seemed
to
be
raising
certain
objections
that
his
chief
officer
kept
answering
with
flat
assurances
at
least
thats
what
i
gathered
from
their
differences
in
tone
and
gesture
as
for
me
i
stared
industriously
in
the
direction
under
observation
but
without
spotting
a
thing
sky
and
water
merged
into
a
perfectly
clean
horizon
line
meanwhile
captain
nemo
strolled
from
one
end
of
the
platform
to
the
other
not
glancing
at
me
perhaps
not
even
seeing
me
his
step
was
firm
but
less
regular
than
usual
sometimes
he
would
stop
cross
his
arms
over
his
chest
and
observe
the
sea
what
could
he
be
looking
for
over
that
immense
expanse
by
then
the
nautilus
lay
hundreds
of
miles
from
the
nearest
coast
the
chief
officer
kept
lifting
his
spyglass
and
stubbornly
examining
the
horizon
walking
up
and
down
stamping
his
foot
in
his
nervous
agitation
a
sharp
contrast
to
his
superior
but
this
mystery
would
inevitably
be
cleared
up
and
soon
because
captain
nemo
gave
orders
to
increase
speed
at
once
the
engine
stepped
up
its
drive
power
setting
the
propeller
in
swifter
rotation
just
then
the
chief
officer
drew
the
captains
attention
anew
the
latter
interrupted
his
strolling
and
aimed
his
spyglass
at
the
point
indicated
he
observed
it
a
good
while
as
for
me
deeply
puzzled
i
went
below
to
the
lounge
and
brought
back
an
excellent
longrange
telescope
i
habitually
used
leaning
my
elbows
on
the
beacon
housing
which
jutted
from
the
stern
of
the
platform
i
got
set
to
scour
that
whole
stretch
of
sky
and
sea
but
no
sooner
had
i
peered
into
the
eyepiece
than
the
instrument
was
snatched
from
my
hands
i
spun
around
captain
nemo
was
standing
before
me
but
i
almost
didnt
recognize
him
his
facial
features
were
transfigured
gleaming
with
dark
fire
his
eyes
had
shrunk
beneath
his
frowning
brow
his
teeth
were
half
bared
his
rigid
body
clenched
fists
and
head
drawn
between
his
shoulders
all
attested
to
a
fierce
hate
breathing
from
every
pore
he
didnt
move
my
spyglass
fell
from
his
hand
and
rolled
at
his
feet
had
i
accidentally
caused
these
symptoms
of
anger
did
this
incomprehensible
individual
think
i
had
detected
some
secret
forbidden
to
guests
on
the
nautilus
no
i
wasnt
the
subject
of
his
hate
because
he
wasnt
even
looking
at
me
his
eyes
stayed
stubbornly
focused
on
that
inscrutable
point
of
the
horizon
finally
captain
nemo
regained
his
selfcontrol
his
facial
appearance
so
profoundly
changed
now
resumed
its
usual
calm
he
addressed
a
few
words
to
his
chief
officer
in
their
strange
language
then
he
turned
to
me
professor
aronnax
he
told
me
in
a
tone
of
some
urgency
i
ask
that
you
now
honor
one
of
the
binding
agreements
between
us
which
one
captain
you
and
your
companions
must
be
placed
in
confinement
until
i
see
fit
to
set
you
free
youre
in
command
i
answered
gaping
at
him
but
may
i
address
a
question
to
you
you
may
not
sir
after
that
i
stopped
objecting
and
started
obeying
since
resistance
was
useless
i
went
below
to
the
cabin
occupied
by
ned
land
and
conseil
and
i
informed
them
of
the
captains
decision
ill
let
the
reader
decide
how
this
news
was
received
by
the
canadian
in
any
case
there
was
no
time
for
explanations
four
crewmen
were
waiting
at
the
door
and
they
led
us
to
the
cell
where
we
had
spent
our
first
night
aboard
the
nautilus
ned
land
tried
to
lodge
a
complaint
but
the
only
answer
he
got
was
a
door
shut
in
his
face
will
master
tell
me
what
this
means
conseil
asked
me
i
told
my
companions
what
had
happened
they
were
as
astonished
as
i
was
but
no
wiser
then
i
sank
into
deep
speculation
and
captain
nemos
strange
facial
seizure
kept
haunting
me
i
was
incapable
of
connecting
two
ideas
in
logical
order
and
i
had
strayed
into
the
most
absurd
hypotheses
when
i
was
snapped
out
of
my
mental
struggles
by
these
words
from
ned
land
well
look
here
lunch
is
served
indeed
the
table
had
been
laid
apparently
captain
nemo
had
given
this
order
at
the
same
time
he
commanded
the
nautilus
to
pick
up
speed
will
master
allow
me
to
make
him
a
recommendation
conseil
asked
me
yes
my
boy
i
replied
well
master
needs
to
eat
his
lunch
its
prudent
because
we
have
no
idea
what
the
future
holds
youre
right
conseil
unfortunately
ned
land
said
theyve
only
given
us
the
standard
menu
ned
my
friend
conseil
answered
what
would
you
say
if
theyd
given
us
no
lunch
at
all
this
dose
of
sanity
cut
the
harpooners
complaints
clean
off
we
sat
down
at
the
table
our
meal
proceeded
pretty
much
in
silence
i
ate
very
little
conseil
everlastingly
prudent
forcefed
himself
and
despite
the
menu
ned
land
didnt
waste
a
bite
then
lunch
over
each
of
us
propped
himself
in
a
corner
just
then
the
luminous
globe
lighting
our
cell
went
out
leaving
us
in
profound
darkness
ned
land
soon
dozed
off
and
to
my
astonishment
conseil
also
fell
into
a
heavy
slumber
i
was
wondering
what
could
have
caused
this
urgent
need
for
sleep
when
i
felt
a
dense
torpor
saturate
my
brain
i
tried
to
keep
my
eyes
open
but
they
closed
in
spite
of
me
i
was
in
the
grip
of
anguished
hallucinations
obviously
some
sleepinducing
substance
had
been
laced
into
the
food
wed
just
eaten
so
imprisonment
wasnt
enough
to
conceal
captain
nemos
plans
from
ussleep
was
needed
as
well
then
i
heard
the
hatches
close
the
seas
undulations
which
had
been
creating
a
gentle
rocking
motion
now
ceased
had
the
nautilus
left
the
surface
of
the
ocean
was
it
reentering
the
motionless
strata
deep
in
the
sea
i
tried
to
fight
off
this
drowsiness
it
was
impossible
my
breathing
grew
weaker
i
felt
a
mortal
chill
freeze
my
dull
nearly
paralyzed
limbs
like
little
domes
of
lead
my
lids
fell
over
my
eyes
i
couldnt
raise
them
a
morbid
sleep
full
of
hallucinations
seized
my
whole
being
then
the
visions
disappeared
and
left
me
in
utter
oblivion
chapter
24
the
coral
realm
the
next
day
i
woke
up
with
my
head
unusually
clear
much
to
my
surprise
i
was
in
my
stateroom
no
doubt
my
companions
had
been
put
back
in
their
cabin
without
noticing
it
any
more
than
i
had
like
me
they
would
have
no
idea
what
took
place
during
the
night
and
to
unravel
this
mystery
i
could
count
only
on
some
future
happenstance
i
then
considered
leaving
my
stateroom
was
i
free
or
still
a
prisoner
perfectly
free
i
opened
my
door
headed
down
the
gangways
and
climbed
the
central
companionway
hatches
that
had
been
closed
the
day
before
were
now
open
i
arrived
on
the
platform
ned
land
and
conseil
were
there
waiting
for
me
i
questioned
them
they
knew
nothing
lost
in
a
heavy
sleep
of
which
they
had
no
memory
they
were
quite
startled
to
be
back
in
their
cabin
as
for
the
nautilus
it
seemed
as
tranquil
and
mysterious
as
ever
it
was
cruising
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
at
a
moderate
speed
nothing
seemed
to
have
changed
on
board
ned
land
observed
the
sea
with
his
penetrating
eyes
it
was
deserted
the
canadian
sighted
nothing
new
on
the
horizon
neither
sail
nor
shore
a
breeze
was
blowing
noisily
from
the
west
and
disheveled
by
the
wind
long
billows
made
the
submersible
roll
very
noticeably
after
renewing
its
air
the
nautilus
stayed
at
an
average
depth
of
fifteen
meters
enabling
it
to
return
quickly
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
and
contrary
to
custom
it
executed
such
a
maneuver
several
times
during
that
day
of
january
19
the
chief
officer
would
then
climb
onto
the
platform
and
his
usual
phrase
would
ring
through
the
ships
interior
as
for
captain
nemo
he
didnt
appear
of
the
other
men
on
board
i
saw
only
my
emotionless
steward
who
served
me
with
his
usual
mute
efficiency
near
two
oclock
i
was
busy
organizing
my
notes
in
the
lounge
when
the
captain
opened
the
door
and
appeared
i
bowed
to
him
he
gave
me
an
almost
imperceptible
bow
in
return
without
saying
a
word
to
me
i
resumed
my
work
hoping
he
might
give
me
some
explanation
of
the
previous
afternoons
events
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
i
stared
at
him
his
face
looked
exhausted
his
reddened
eyes
hadnt
been
refreshed
by
sleep
his
facial
features
expressed
profound
sadness
real
chagrin
he
walked
up
and
down
sat
and
stood
picked
up
a
book
at
random
discarded
it
immediately
consulted
his
instruments
without
taking
his
customary
notes
and
seemed
unable
to
rest
easy
for
an
instant
finally
he
came
over
to
me
and
said
are
you
a
physician
professor
aronnax
this
inquiry
was
so
unexpected
that
i
stared
at
him
a
good
while
without
replying
are
you
a
physician
he
repeated
several
of
your
scientific
colleagues
took
their
degrees
in
medicine
such
as
gratiolet
moquintandon
and
others
thats
right
i
said
i
am
a
doctor
i
used
to
be
on
call
at
the
hospitals
i
was
in
practice
for
several
years
before
joining
the
museum
excellent
sir
my
reply
obviously
pleased
captain
nemo
but
not
knowing
what
he
was
driving
at
i
waited
for
further
questions
ready
to
reply
as
circumstances
dictated
professor
aronnax
the
captain
said
to
me
would
you
consent
to
give
your
medical
attentions
to
one
of
my
men
someone
is
sick
yes
im
ready
to
go
with
you
come
i
admit
that
my
heart
was
pounding
lord
knows
why
but
i
saw
a
definite
connection
between
this
sick
crewman
and
yesterdays
happenings
and
the
mystery
of
those
events
concerned
me
at
least
as
much
as
the
mans
sickness
captain
nemo
led
me
to
the
nautiluss
stern
and
invited
me
into
a
cabin
located
next
to
the
sailors
quarters
on
a
bed
there
lay
a
man
some
forty
years
old
with
strongly
molded
features
the
very
image
of
an
anglosaxon
i
bent
over
him
not
only
was
he
sick
he
was
wounded
swathed
in
bloodsoaked
linen
his
head
was
resting
on
a
folded
pillow
i
undid
the
linen
bandages
while
the
wounded
man
gazed
with
great
staring
eyes
and
let
me
proceed
without
making
a
single
complaint
it
was
a
horrible
wound
the
cranium
had
been
smashed
open
by
some
blunt
instrument
leaving
the
naked
brains
exposed
and
the
cerebral
matter
had
suffered
deep
abrasions
blood
clots
had
formed
in
this
dissolving
mass
taking
on
the
color
of
wine
dregs
both
contusion
and
concussion
of
the
brain
had
occurred
the
sick
mans
breathing
was
labored
and
muscle
spasms
quivered
in
his
face
cerebral
inflammation
was
complete
and
had
brought
on
a
paralysis
of
movement
and
sensation
i
took
the
wounded
mans
pulse
it
was
intermittent
the
bodys
extremities
were
already
growing
cold
and
i
saw
that
death
was
approaching
without
any
possibility
of
my
holding
it
in
check
after
dressing
the
poor
mans
wound
i
redid
the
linen
bandages
around
his
head
and
i
turned
to
captain
nemo
how
did
he
get
this
wound
i
asked
him
thats
not
important
the
captain
replied
evasively
the
nautilus
suffered
a
collision
that
cracked
one
of
the
engine
levers
and
it
struck
this
man
my
chief
officer
was
standing
beside
him
this
man
leaped
forward
to
intercept
the
blow
a
brother
lays
down
his
life
for
his
brother
a
friend
for
his
friend
what
could
be
simpler
thats
the
law
for
everyone
on
board
the
nautilus
but
whats
your
diagnosis
of
his
condition
i
hesitated
to
speak
my
mind
you
may
talk
freely
the
captain
told
me
this
man
doesnt
understand
french
i
took
a
last
look
at
the
wounded
man
then
i
replied
this
man
will
be
dead
in
two
hours
nothing
can
save
him
nothing
captain
nemo
clenched
his
fists
and
tears
slid
from
his
eyes
which
i
had
thought
incapable
of
weeping
for
a
few
moments
more
i
observed
the
dying
man
whose
life
was
ebbing
little
by
little
he
grew
still
more
pale
under
the
electric
light
that
bathed
his
deathbed
i
looked
at
his
intelligent
head
furrowed
with
premature
wrinkles
that
misfortune
perhaps
misery
had
etched
long
before
i
was
hoping
to
detect
the
secret
of
his
life
in
the
last
words
that
might
escape
from
his
lips
you
may
go
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
told
me
i
left
the
captain
in
the
dying
mans
cabin
and
i
repaired
to
my
stateroom
very
moved
by
this
scene
all
day
long
i
was
aquiver
with
gruesome
forebodings
that
night
i
slept
poorly
and
between
my
fitful
dreams
i
thought
i
heard
a
distant
moaning
like
a
funeral
dirge
was
it
a
prayer
for
the
dead
murmured
in
that
language
i
couldnt
understand
the
next
morning
i
climbed
on
deck
captain
nemo
was
already
there
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
came
over
professor
he
said
to
me
would
it
be
convenient
for
you
to
make
an
underwater
excursion
today
with
my
companions
i
asked
if
theyre
agreeable
were
yours
to
command
captain
then
kindly
put
on
your
diving
suits
as
for
the
dead
or
dying
man
he
hadnt
come
into
the
picture
i
rejoined
ned
land
and
conseil
i
informed
them
of
captain
nemos
proposition
conseil
was
eager
to
accept
and
this
time
the
canadian
proved
perfectly
amenable
to
going
with
us
it
was
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
by
830
we
were
suited
up
for
this
new
stroll
and
equipped
with
our
two
devices
for
lighting
and
breathing
the
double
door
opened
and
accompanied
by
captain
nemo
with
a
dozen
crewmen
following
we
set
foot
on
the
firm
seafloor
where
the
nautilus
was
resting
ten
meters
down
a
gentle
slope
gravitated
to
an
uneven
bottom
whose
depth
was
about
fifteen
fathoms
this
bottom
was
completely
different
from
the
one
i
had
visited
during
my
first
excursion
under
the
waters
of
the
pacific
ocean
here
i
saw
no
finegrained
sand
no
underwater
prairies
not
one
opensea
forest
i
immediately
recognized
the
wondrous
region
in
which
captain
nemo
did
the
honors
that
day
it
was
the
coral
realm
in
the
zoophyte
branch
class
alcyonaria
one
finds
the
order
gorgonaria
which
contains
three
groups
sea
fans
isidian
polyps
and
coral
polyps
its
in
this
last
that
precious
coral
belongs
an
unusual
substance
that
at
different
times
has
been
classified
in
the
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
kingdoms
medicine
to
the
ancients
jewelry
to
the
moderns
it
wasnt
decisively
placed
in
the
animal
kingdom
until
1694
by
peysonnel
of
marseilles
a
coral
is
a
unit
of
tiny
animals
assembled
over
a
polypary
thats
brittle
and
stony
in
nature
these
polyps
have
a
unique
generating
mechanism
that
reproduces
them
via
the
budding
process
and
they
have
an
individual
existence
while
also
participating
in
a
communal
life
hence
they
embody
a
sort
of
natural
socialism
i
was
familiar
with
the
latest
research
on
this
bizarre
zoophytewhich
turns
to
stone
while
taking
on
a
tree
form
as
some
naturalists
have
very
aptly
observedand
nothing
could
have
been
more
fascinating
to
me
than
to
visit
one
of
these
petrified
forests
that
nature
has
planted
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
we
turned
on
our
ruhmkorff
devices
and
went
along
a
coral
shoal
in
the
process
of
forming
which
given
time
will
someday
close
off
this
whole
part
of
the
indian
ocean
our
path
was
bordered
by
hopelessly
tangled
bushes
formed
from
snarls
of
shrubs
all
covered
with
little
starshaped
whitestreaked
flowers
only
contrary
to
plants
on
shore
these
tree
forms
become
attached
to
rocks
on
the
seafloor
by
heading
from
top
to
bottom
our
lights
produced
a
thousand
delightful
effects
while
playing
over
these
brightly
colored
boughs
i
fancied
i
saw
these
cylindrical
membranefilled
tubes
trembling
beneath
the
waters
undulations
i
was
tempted
to
gather
their
fresh
petals
which
were
adorned
with
delicate
tentacles
some
newly
in
bloom
others
barely
opened
while
nimble
fish
with
fluttering
fins
brushed
past
them
like
flocks
of
birds
but
if
my
hands
came
near
the
moving
flowers
of
these
sensitive
lively
creatures
an
alarm
would
instantly
sound
throughout
the
colony
the
white
petals
retracted
into
their
red
sheaths
the
flowers
vanished
before
my
eyes
and
the
bush
changed
into
a
chunk
of
stony
nipples
sheer
chance
had
placed
me
in
the
presence
of
the
most
valuable
specimens
of
this
zoophyte
this
coral
was
the
equal
of
those
fished
up
from
the
mediterranean
off
the
barbary
coast
or
the
shores
of
france
and
italy
with
its
bright
colors
it
lived
up
to
those
poetic
names
of
blood
flower
and
blood
foam
that
the
industry
confers
on
its
finest
exhibits
coral
sells
for
as
much
as
500
francs
per
kilogram
and
in
this
locality
the
liquid
strata
hid
enough
to
make
the
fortunes
of
a
whole
host
of
coral
fishermen
this
valuable
substance
often
merges
with
other
polyparies
forming
compact
hopelessly
tangled
units
known
as
macciota
and
i
noted
some
wonderful
pink
samples
of
this
coral
but
as
the
bushes
shrank
the
tree
forms
magnified
actual
petrified
thickets
and
long
alcoves
from
some
fantastic
school
of
architecture
kept
opening
up
before
our
steps
captain
nemo
entered
beneath
a
dark
gallery
whose
gentle
slope
took
us
to
a
depth
of
100
meters
the
light
from
our
glass
coils
produced
magical
effects
at
times
lingering
on
the
wrinkled
roughness
of
some
natural
arch
or
some
overhang
suspended
like
a
chandelier
which
our
lamps
flecked
with
fiery
sparks
amid
these
shrubs
of
precious
coral
i
observed
other
polyps
no
less
unusual
melita
coral
rainbow
coral
with
jointed
outgrowths
then
a
few
tufts
of
genus
corallina
some
green
and
others
red
actually
a
type
of
seaweed
encrusted
with
limestone
salts
which
after
long
disputes
naturalists
have
finally
placed
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
but
as
one
intellectual
has
remarked
here
perhaps
is
the
actual
point
where
life
rises
humbly
out
of
slumbering
stone
but
without
breaking
away
from
its
crude
starting
point
finally
after
two
hours
of
walking
we
reached
a
depth
of
about
300
meters
in
other
words
the
lowermost
limit
at
which
coral
can
begin
to
form
but
here
it
was
no
longer
some
isolated
bush
or
a
modest
grove
of
low
timber
it
was
an
immense
forest
huge
mineral
vegetation
enormous
petrified
trees
linked
by
garlands
of
elegant
hydras
from
the
genus
plumularia
those
tropical
creepers
of
the
sea
all
decked
out
in
shades
and
gleams
we
passed
freely
under
their
lofty
boughs
lost
up
in
the
shadows
of
the
waves
while
at
our
feet
organpipe
coral
stony
coral
star
coral
fungus
coral
and
sea
anemone
from
the
genus
caryophylia
formed
a
carpet
of
flowers
all
strewn
with
dazzling
gems
what
an
indescribable
sight
oh
if
only
we
could
share
our
feelings
why
were
we
imprisoned
behind
these
masks
of
metal
and
glass
why
were
we
forbidden
to
talk
with
each
other
at
least
let
us
lead
the
lives
of
the
fish
that
populate
this
liquid
element
or
better
yet
the
lives
of
amphibians
which
can
spend
long
hours
either
at
sea
or
on
shore
traveling
through
their
double
domain
as
their
whims
dictate
meanwhile
captain
nemo
had
called
a
halt
my
companions
and
i
stopped
walking
and
turning
around
i
saw
the
crewmen
form
a
semicircle
around
their
leader
looking
with
greater
care
i
observed
that
four
of
them
were
carrying
on
their
shoulders
an
object
that
was
oblong
in
shape
at
this
locality
we
stood
in
the
center
of
a
huge
clearing
surrounded
by
the
tall
tree
forms
of
this
underwater
forest
our
lamps
cast
a
sort
of
brilliant
twilight
over
the
area
making
inordinately
long
shadows
on
the
seafloor
past
the
boundaries
of
the
clearing
the
darkness
deepened
again
relieved
only
by
little
sparkles
given
off
by
the
sharp
crests
of
coral
ned
land
and
conseil
stood
next
to
me
we
stared
and
it
dawned
on
me
that
i
was
about
to
witness
a
strange
scene
observing
the
seafloor
i
saw
that
it
swelled
at
certain
points
from
low
bulges
that
were
encrusted
with
limestone
deposits
and
arranged
with
a
symmetry
that
betrayed
the
hand
of
man
in
the
middle
of
the
clearing
on
a
pedestal
of
roughly
piled
rocks
there
stood
a
cross
of
coral
extending
long
arms
you
would
have
thought
were
made
of
petrified
blood
at
a
signal
from
captain
nemo
one
of
his
men
stepped
forward
and
a
few
feet
from
this
cross
detached
a
mattock
from
his
belt
and
began
to
dig
a
hole
i
finally
understood
this
clearing
was
a
cemetery
this
hole
a
grave
that
oblong
object
the
body
of
the
man
who
must
have
died
during
the
night
captain
nemo
and
his
men
had
come
to
bury
their
companion
in
this
communal
resting
place
on
the
inaccessible
ocean
floor
no
my
mind
was
reeling
as
never
before
never
had
ideas
of
such
impact
raced
through
my
brain
i
didnt
want
to
see
what
my
eyes
saw
meanwhile
the
grave
digging
went
slowly
fish
fled
here
and
there
as
their
retreat
was
disturbed
i
heard
the
pick
ringing
on
the
limestone
soil
its
iron
tip
sometimes
giving
off
sparks
when
it
hit
a
stray
piece
of
flint
on
the
sea
bottom
the
hole
grew
longer
wider
and
soon
was
deep
enough
to
receive
the
body
then
the
pallbearers
approached
wrapped
in
white
fabric
made
from
filaments
of
the
fan
mussel
the
body
was
lowered
into
its
watery
grave
captain
nemo
arms
crossed
over
his
chest
knelt
in
a
posture
of
prayer
as
did
all
the
friends
of
him
who
had
loved
them



my
two
companions
and
i
bowed
reverently
the
grave
was
then
covered
over
with
the
rubble
dug
from
the
seafloor
and
it
formed
a
low
mound
when
this
was
done
captain
nemo
and
his
men
stood
up
then
they
all
approached
the
grave
sank
again
on
bended
knee
and
extended
their
hands
in
a
sign
of
final
farewell



then
the
funeral
party
went
back
up
the
path
to
the
nautilus
returning
beneath
the
arches
of
the
forest
through
the
thickets
along
the
coral
bushes
going
steadily
higher
finally
the
ships
rays
appeared
their
luminous
trail
guided
us
to
the
nautilus
by
one
oclock
we
had
returned
after
changing
clothes
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
and
in
the
grip
of
dreadfully
obsessive
thoughts
i
sat
next
to
the
beacon
captain
nemo
rejoined
me
i
stood
up
and
said
to
him
so
as
i
predicted
that
man
died
during
the
night
yes
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
replied
and
now
he
rests
beside
his
companions
in
that
coral
cemetery
yes
forgotten
by
the
world
but
not
by
us
we
dig
the
graves
then
entrust
the
polyps
with
sealing
away
our
dead
for
eternity
and
with
a
sudden
gesture
the
captain
hid
his
face
in
his
clenched
fists
vainly
trying
to
hold
back
a
sob
then
he
added
there
lies
our
peaceful
cemetery
hundreds
of
feet
beneath
the
surface
of
the
waves
at
least
captain
your
dead
can
sleep
serenely
there
out
of
the
reach
of
sharks
yes
sir
captain
nemo
replied

the

ocean
now
we
begin
the
second
part
of
this
voyage
under
the
seas
the
first
ended
in
that
moving
scene
at
the
coral
cemetery
which
left
a
profound
impression
on
my
mind
and
so
captain
nemo
would
live
out
his
life
entirely
in
the
heart
of
this
immense
sea
and
even
his
grave
lay
ready
in
its
impenetrable
depths
there
the
last
sleep
of
the
nautiluss
occupants
friends
bound
together
in
death
as
in
life
would
be
disturbed
by
no
monster
of
the
deep
no
man
either
the
captain
had
added
always
that
same
fierce
implacable
defiance
of
human
society
as
for
me
i
was
no
longer
content
with
the
hypotheses
that
satisfied
conseil
that
fine
lad
persisted
in
seeing
the
nautiluss
commander
as
merely
one
of
those
unappreciated
scientists
who
repay
humanitys
indifference
with
contempt
for
conseil
the
captain
was
still
a
misunderstood
genius
who
tired
of
the
worlds
deceptions
had
been
driven
to
take
refuge
in
this
inaccessible
environment
where
he
was
free
to
follow
his
instincts
but
to
my
mind
this
hypothesis
explained
only
one
side
of
captain
nemo
in
fact
the
mystery
of
that
last
afternoon
when
we
were
locked
in
prison
and
put
to
sleep
the
captains
violent
precaution
of
snatching
from
my
grasp
a
spyglass
poised
to
scour
the
horizon
and
the
fatal
wound
given
that
man
during
some
unexplained
collision
suffered
by
the
nautilus
all
led
me
down
a
plain
trail
no
captain
nemo
wasnt
content
simply
to
avoid
humanity
his
fearsome
submersible
served
not
only
his
quest
for
freedom
but
also
perhaps
it
was
used
in
lordknowswhat
schemes
of
dreadful
revenge
right
now
nothing
is
clear
to
me
i
still
glimpse
only
glimmers
in
the
dark
and
i
must
limit
my
pen
as
it
were
to
taking
dictation
from
events
but
nothing
binds
us
to
captain
nemo
he
believes
that
escaping
from
the
nautilus
is
impossible
we
are
not
even
constrained
by
our
word
of
honor
no
promises
fetter
us
were
simply
captives
prisoners
masquerading
under
the
name
guests
for
the
sake
of
everyday
courtesy
even
so
ned
land
hasnt
given
up
all
hope
of
recovering
his
freedom
hes
sure
to
take
advantage
of
the
first
chance
that
comes
his
way
no
doubt
i
will
do
likewise
and
yet
i
will
feel
some
regret
at
making
off
with
the
nautiluss
secrets
so
generously
unveiled
for
us
by
captain
nemo
because
ultimately
should
we
detest
or
admire
this
man
is
he
the
persecutor
or
the
persecuted
and
in
all
honesty
before
i
leave
him
forever
i
want
to
finish
this
underwater
tour
of
the
world
whose
first
stages
have
been
so
magnificent
i
want
to
observe
the
full
series
of
these
wonders
gathered
under
the
seas
of
our
globe
i
want
to
see
what
no
man
has
seen
yet
even
if
i
must
pay
for
this
insatiable
curiosity
with
my
life
what
are
my
discoveries
to
date
nothing
relatively
speakingsince
so
far
weve
covered
only
6000
leagues
across
the
pacific
nevertheless
im
well
aware
that
the
nautilus
is
drawing
near
to
populated
shores
and
if
some
chance
for
salvation
becomes
available
to
us
it
would
be
sheer
cruelty
to
sacrifice
my
companions
to
my
passion
for
the
unknown
i
must
go
with
them
perhaps
even
guide
them
but
will
this
opportunity
ever
arise
the
human
being
robbed
of
his
free
will
craves
such
an
opportunity
but
the
scientist
forever
inquisitive
dreads
it
that
day
january
21
1868
the
chief
officer
went
at
noon
to
take
the
suns
altitude
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
lit
a
cigar
and
watched
him
at
work
it
seemed
obvious
to
me
that
this
man
didnt
understand
french
because
i
made
several
remarks
in
a
loud
voice
that
were
bound
to
provoke
him
to
some
involuntary
show
of
interest
had
he
understood
them
but
he
remained
mute
and
emotionless
while
he
took
his
sights
with
his
sextant
one
of
the
nautiluss
sailorsthat
muscular
man
who
had
gone
with
us
to
crespo
island
during
our
first
underwater
excursioncame
up
to
clean
the
glass
panes
of
the
beacon
i
then
examined
the
fittings
of
this
mechanism
whose
power
was
increased
a
hundredfold
by
biconvex
lenses
that
were
designed
like
those
in
a
lighthouse
and
kept
its
rays
productively
focused
this
electric
lamp
was
so
constructed
as
to
yield
its
maximum
illuminating
power
in
essence
its
light
was
generated
in
a
vacuum
insuring
both
its
steadiness
and
intensity
such
a
vacuum
also
reduced
wear
on
the
graphite
points
between
which
the
luminous
arc
expanded
this
was
an
important
savings
for
captain
nemo
who
couldnt
easily
renew
them
but
under
these
conditions
wear
and
tear
were
almost
nonexistent
when
the
nautilus
was
ready
to
resume
its
underwater
travels
i
went
below
again
to
the
lounge
the
hatches
closed
once
more
and
our
course
was
set
due
west
we
then
plowed
the
waves
of
the
indian
ocean
vast
liquid
plains
with
an
area
of
550000000
hectares
whose
waters
are
so
transparent
it
makes
you
dizzy
to
lean
over
their
surface
there
the
nautilus
generally
drifted
at
a
depth
between
100
and
200
meters
it
behaved
in
this
way
for
some
days
to
anyone
without
my
grand
passion
for
the
sea
these
hours
would
surely
have
seemed
long
and
monotonous
but
my
daily
strolls
on
the
platform
where
i
was
revived
by
the
lifegiving
ocean
air
the
sights
in
the
rich
waters
beyond
the
lounge
windows
the
books
to
be
read
in
the
library
and
the
composition
of
my
memoirs
took
up
all
my
time
and
left
me
without
a
moment
of
weariness
or
boredom
all
in
all
we
enjoyed
a
highly
satisfactory
state
of
health
the
diet
on
board
agreed
with
us
perfectly
and
for
my
part
i
could
easily
have
gone
without
those
changes
of
pace
that
ned
land
in
a
spirit
of
protest
kept
taxing
his
ingenuity
to
supply
us
whats
more
in
this
constant
temperature
we
didnt
even
have
to
worry
about
catching
colds
besides
the
ship
had
a
good
stock
of
the
madrepore
dendrophylia
known
in
provence
by
the
name
sea
fennel
and
a
poultice
made
from
the
dissolved
flesh
of
its
polyps
will
furnish
an
excellent
cough
medicine
for
some
days
we
saw
a
large
number
of
aquatic
birds
with
webbed
feet
known
as
gulls
or
sea
mews
some
were
skillfully
slain
and
when
cooked
in
a
certain
fashion
they
make
a
very
acceptable
platter
of
water
game
among
the
great
wind
riderscarried
over
long
distances
from
every
shore
and
resting
on
the
waves
from
their
exhausting
flightsi
spotted
some
magnificent
albatross
birds
belonging
to
the
longipennes
longwinged
family
whose
discordant
calls
sound
like
the
braying
of
an
ass
the
totipalmes
fully
webbed
family
was
represented
by
swift
frigate
birds
nimbly
catching
fish
at
the
surface
and
by
numerous
tropic
birds
of
the
genus
phaeton
among
others
the
redtailed
tropic
bird
the
size
of
a
pigeon
its
white
plumage
shaded
with
pink
tints
that
contrasted
with
its
darkhued
wings
the
nautiluss
nets
hauled
up
several
types
of
sea
turtle
from
the
hawksbill
genus
with
arching
backs
whose
scales
are
highly
prized
diving
easily
these
reptiles
can
remain
a
good
while
underwater
by
closing
the
fleshy
valves
located
at
the
external
openings
of
their
nasal
passages
when
they
were
captured
some
hawksbills
were
still
asleep
inside
their
carapaces
a
refuge
from
other
marine
animals
the
flesh
of
these
turtles
was
nothing
memorable
but
their
eggs
made
an
excellent
feast
as
for
fish
they
always
filled
us
with
wonderment
when
staring
through
the
open
panels
we
could
unveil
the
secrets
of
their
aquatic
lives
i
noted
several
species
i
hadnt
previously
been
able
to
observe
ill
mention
chiefly
some
trunkfish
unique
to
the
red
sea
the
sea
of
the
east
indies
and
that
part
of
the
ocean
washing
the
coasts
of
equinoctial
america
like
turtles
armadillos
sea
urchins
and
crustaceans
these
fish
are
protected
by
armor
plate
thats
neither
chalky
nor
stony
but
actual
bone
sometimes
this
armor
takes
the
shape
of
a
solid
triangle
sometimes
that
of
a
solid
quadrangle
among
the
triangular
type
i
noticed
some
half
a
decimeter
long
with
brown
tails
yellow
fins
and
wholesome
exquisitely
tasty
flesh
i
even
recommend
that
they
be
acclimatized
to
fresh
water
a
change
incidentally
that
a
number
of
saltwater
fish
can
make
with
ease
ill
also
mention
some
quadrangular
trunkfish
topped
by
four
large
protuberances
along
the
back
trunkfish
sprinkled
with
white
spots
on
the

of
the

make
good

like
certain
birds
boxfish
armed
with
stings
formed
by
extensions
of
their
bony
crusts
and
whose
odd
grunting
has
earned
them
the
nickname
sea
pigs
then
some
trunkfish
known
as
dromedaries
with
tough
leathery
flesh
and
big
conical
humps
from
the
daily
notes
kept
by
mr

i
also
retrieve
certain
fish
from
the
genus
tetradon
unique
to
these

southern
puffers
with
red

noted
some
scorpionfish

adorned
with
stings

have

these

from

21
to
the

the
nautilus
traveled
at
the
rate
of
250
leagues
in
twentyfour
hours
hence
540
miles
at
twentytwo
miles
per
hour
if
during
our
trip
we
were
able
to
identify
these
different
varieties
of
fish
its
because
they
were
attracted
by
our
electric
light
and
tried
to
follow
alongside
but
most
of
them
were
outdistanced
by
our
speed
and
soon
fell
behind
temporarily
however
a
few
managed
to
keep
pace
in
the
nautiluss
waters
on
the
morning
of
the
24th
in
latitude
12

we
raised
keeling
island
a
madreporic
upheaving
planted
with
magnificent
coconut
trees
which
had
been
visited
by
mr
darwin
and
captain
fitzroy
the
nautilus
cruised
along
a
short
distance
off
the
shore
of
this
desert
island
our
dragnets
brought
up
many
specimens
of
polyps
and
echinoderms
plus
some
unusual
shells
from
the
branch
mollusca
captain
nemos
treasures
were
enhanced
by
some
valuable
exhibits
from
the
delphinula
snail
species
to
which
i
joined
some
pointed
star
coral
a
sort
of
parasitic
polypary
that
often
attaches
itself
to
seashells
soon
keeling
island
disappeared
below
the
horizon
and
our
course
was
set
to
the
northwest
toward
the
tip
of
the
indian
peninsula
civilization
ned
land
told
me
that
day
much
better
than
those
papuan
islands
where
we
ran
into
more
savages
than
venison
on
this
indian
shore
professor
there
are
roads
and
railways
english
french
and
hindu
villages
we
wouldnt
go
five
miles
without
bumping
into
a
fellow
countryman
come
on
now
isnt
it
time
for
our
sudden
departure
from
captain
nemo
no
no
ned
i
replied
in
a
very
firm
tone
lets
ride
it
out
as
you
seafaring
fellows
say
the
nautilus
is
approaching
populated
areas
its
going
back
toward
europe
let
it
take
us
there
after
we
arrive
in
home
waters
we
can
do
as
we
see
fit
besides
i
dont
imagine
captain
nemo
will
let
us
go
hunting
on
the
coasts
of
malabar
or
coromandel
as
he
did
in
the
forests
of
new
guinea
well
sir
cant
we
manage
without
his
permission
i
didnt
answer
the
canadian
i
wanted
no
arguments
deep
down
i
was
determined
to
fully
exploit
the
good
fortune
that
had
put
me
on
board
the
nautilus
after
leaving
keeling
island
our
pace
got
generally
slower
it
also
got
more
unpredictable
often
taking
us
to
great
depths
several
times
we
used
our
slanting
fins
which
internal
levers
could
set
at
an
oblique
angle
to
our
waterline
thus
we
went
as
deep
as
two
or
three
kilometers
down
but
without
ever
verifying
the
lowest
depths
of
this
sea
near
india
which
soundings
of
13000
meters
have
been
unable
to
reach
as
for
the
temperature
in
these
lower
strata
the
thermometer
always
and
invariably
indicated
4
degrees
centigrade
i
merely
observed
that
in
the
upper
layers
the
water
was
always
colder
over
shallows
than
in
the
open
sea
on
january
25
the
ocean
being
completely
deserted
the
nautilus
spent
the
day
on
the
surface
churning
the
waves
with
its
powerful
propeller
and
making
them
spurt
to
great
heights
under
these
conditions
who
wouldnt
have
mistaken
it
for
a
gigantic
cetacean
i
spent
threequarters
of
the
day
on
the
platform
i
stared
at
the
sea
nothing
on
the
horizon
except
near
four
oclock
in
the
afternoon
a
long
steamer
to
the
west
running
on
our
opposite
tack
its
masting
was
visible
for
an
instant
but
it
couldnt
have
seen
the
nautilus
because
we
were
lying
too
low
in
the
water
i
imagine
that
steamboat
belonged
to
the
peninsular

oriental
line
which
provides
service
from
the
island
of
ceylon
to
sydney
also
calling
at
king
george
sound
and
melbourne
at
five
oclock
in
the
afternoon
just
before
that
brief
twilight
that
links
day
with
night
in
tropical
zones
conseil
and
i
marveled
at
an
unusual
sight
it
was
a
delightful
animal
whose
discovery
according
to
the
ancients
is
a
sign
of
good
luck
aristotle
athenaeus
pliny
and
oppian
studied
its
habits
and
lavished
on
its
behalf
all
the
scientific
poetry
of
greece
and
italy
they
called
it
nautilus
and
pompilius
but
modern
science
has
not
endorsed
these
designations
and
this
mollusk
is
now
known
by
the
name
argonaut
anyone
consulting
conseil
would
soon
learn
from
the
gallant
lad
that
the
branch
mollusca
is
divided
into
five
classes
that
the
first
class
features
the
cephalopoda
whose
members
are
sometimes
naked
sometimes
covered
with
a
shell
which
consists
of
two
families
the
dibranchiata
and
the
tetrabranchiata
which
are
distinguished
by
their
number
of
gills
that
the
family
dibranchiata
includes
three
genera
the
argonaut
the
squid
and
the
cuttlefish
and
that
the
family
tetrabranchiata
contains
only
one
genus
the
nautilus
after
this
catalog
if
some
recalcitrant
listener
confuses
the
argonaut
which
is
acetabuliferous
in
other
words
a
bearer
of
suction
tubes
with
the
nautilus
which
is
tentaculiferous
a
bearer
of
tentacles
it
will
be
simply
unforgivable
now
it
was
a
school
of
argonauts
then
voyaging
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
we
could
count
several
hundred
of
them
they
belonged
to
that
species
of
argonaut
covered
with
protuberances
and
exclusive
to
the
seas
near
india
these
graceful
mollusks
were
swimming
backward
by
means
of
their
locomotive
tubes
sucking
water
into
these
tubes
and
then
expelling
it
six
of
their
eight
tentacles
were
long
thin
and
floated
on
the
water
while
the
other
two
were
rounded
into
palms
and
spread
to
the
wind
like
light
sails
i
could
see
perfectly
their
undulating
spiralshaped
shells
which
cuvier
aptly
compared
to
an
elegant
cockleboat
its
an
actual
boat
indeed
it
transports
the
animal
that
secretes
it
without
the
animal
sticking
to
it
the
argonaut
is
free
to
leave
its
shell
i
told
conseil
but
it
never
does
not
unlike
captain
nemo
conseil
replied
sagely
which
is
why
he
should
have
christened
his
ship
the
argonaut
for
about
an
hour
the
nautilus
cruised
in
the
midst
of
this
school
of
mollusks
then
lord
knows
why
they
were
gripped
with
a
sudden
fear
as
if
at
a
signal
every
sail
was
abruptly
lowered
arms
folded
bodies
contracted
shells
turned
over
by
changing
their
center
of
gravity
and
the
whole
flotilla
disappeared
under
the
waves
it
was
instantaneous
and
no
squadron
of
ships
ever
maneuvered
with
greater
togetherness
just
then
night
fell
suddenly
and
the
waves
barely
surged
in
the
breeze
spreading
placidly
around
the
nautiluss
side
plates
the
next
day
january
26
we
cut
the
equator
on
the
82nd
meridian
and
we
reentered
the
northern
hemisphere
during
that
day
a
fearsome
school
of
sharks
provided
us
with
an
escort
dreadful
animals
that
teem
in
these
seas
and
make
them
extremely
dangerous
there
were
port
jackson
sharks
with
a
brown
back
a
whitish
belly
and
eleven
rows
of
teeth
bigeye
sharks
with
necks
marked
by
a
large
black
spot
encircled
in
white
and
resembling
an
eye
and
isabella
sharks
whose
rounded
snouts
were
strewn
with
dark
speckles
often
these
powerful
animals
rushed
at
the
lounge
window
with
a
violence
less
than
comforting
by
this
point
ned
land
had
lost
all
selfcontrol
he
wanted
to
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
and
harpoon
the
monsters
especially
certain
smoothhound
sharks
whose
mouths
were
paved
with
teeth
arranged
like
a
mosaic
and
some
big
fivemeter
tiger
sharks
that
insisted
on
personally
provoking
him
but
the
nautilus
soon
picked
up
speed
and
easily
left
astern
the
fastest
of
these
maneaters
on
january
27
at
the
entrance
to
the
huge
bay
of
bengal
we
repeatedly
encountered
a
gruesome
sight
human
corpses
floating
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
carried
by
the
ganges
to
the
high
seas
these
were
deceased
indian
villagers
who
hadnt
been
fully
devoured
by
vultures
the
only
morticians
in
these
parts
but
there
was
no
shortage
of
sharks
to
assist
them
with
their
undertaking
chores
near
seven
oclock
in
the
evening
the
nautilus
lay
half
submerged
navigating
in
the
midst
of
milky
white
waves
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
ocean
seemed
lactified
was
it
an
effect
of
the
moons
rays
no
because
the
new
moon
was
barely
two
days
old
and
was
still
lost
below
the
horizon
in
the
suns
rays
the
entire
sky
although
lit
up
by
stellar
radiation
seemed
pitchblack
in
comparison
with
the
whiteness
of
these
waters
conseil
couldnt
believe
his
eyes
and
he
questioned
me
about
the
causes
of
this
odd
phenomenon
luckily
i
was
in
a
position
to
answer
him
thats
called
a
milk
sea
i
told
him
a
vast
expanse
of
white
waves
often
seen
along
the
coasts
of
amboina
and
in
these
waterways
but
conseil
asked
could
master
tell
me
the
cause
of
this
effect
because
i
presume
this
water
hasnt
really
changed
into
milk
no
my
boy
and
this
whiteness
that
amazes
you
is
merely
due
to
the
presence
of
myriads
of
tiny
creatures
called
infusoria
a
sort
of
diminutive
glowworm
thats
colorless
and
gelatinous
in
appearance
as
thick
as
a
strand
of
hair
and
no
longer
than
onefifth
of
a
millimeter
some
of
these
tiny
creatures
stick
together
over
an
area
of
several
leagues
several
leagues
conseil
exclaimed
yes
my
boy
and
dont
even
try
to
compute
the
number
of
these
infusoria
you
wont
pull
it
off
because
if
im
not
mistaken
certain
navigators
have
cruised
through
milk
seas
for
more
than
forty
miles
im
not
sure
that
conseil
heeded
my
recommendation
because
he
seemed
to
be
deep
in
thought
no
doubt
trying
to
calculate
how
many
onefifths
of
a
millimeter
are
found
in
forty
square
miles
as
for
me
i
continued
to
observe
this
phenomenon
for
several
hours
the
nautiluss
spur
sliced
through
these
whitish
waves
and
i
watched
it
glide
noiselessly
over
this
soapy
water
as
if
it
were
cruising
through
those
foaming
eddies
that
a
bays
currents
and
countercurrents
sometimes
leave
between
each
other
near
midnight
the
sea
suddenly
resumed
its
usual
hue
but
behind
us
all
the
way
to
the
horizon
the
skies
kept
mirroring
the
whiteness
of
those
waves
and
for
a
good
while
seemed
imbued
with
the
hazy
glow
of
an
aurora
borealis
chapter

a
new
proposition
from
captain
nemo
on
january
28
in
latitude
9
degrees
4
north
when
the
nautilus
returned
at
noon
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
it
lay
in
sight
of
land
some
eight
miles
to
the
west
right
off
i
observed
a
cluster
of
mountains
about
2000
feet
high
whose
shapes
were
very
whimsically
sculpted
after
our
position
fix
i
reentered
the
lounge
and
when
our
bearings
were
reported
on
the
chart
i
saw
that
we
were
off
the
island
of
ceylon
that
pearl
dangling
from
the
lower
lobe
of
the
indian
peninsula
i
went
looking
in
the
library
for
a
book
about
this
island
one
of
the
most
fertile
in
the
world
sure
enough
i
found
a
volume
entitled
ceylon
and
the
singhalese
by
h
c
sirr
esq
reentering
the
lounge
i
first
noted
the
bearings
of
ceylon
on
which
antiquity
lavished
so
many
different
names
it
was
located
between
latitude
5
degrees
55
and
9
degrees
49
north
and
between
longitude
79
degrees
42
and
82
degrees
4
east
of
the
meridian
of
greenwich
its
length
is
275
miles
its
maximum
width
150
miles
its
circumference
900
miles
its
surface
area
24448
square
miles
in
other
words
a
little
smaller
than
that
of
ireland
just
then
captain
nemo
and
his
chief
officer
appeared
the
captain
glanced
at
the
chart
then
turning
to
me
the
island
of
ceylon
he
said
is
famous
for
its
pearl
fisheries
would
you
be
interested
professor
aronnax
in
visiting
one
of
those
fisheries
certainly
captain
fine
its
easily
done
only
when
we
see
the
fisheries
well
see
no
fishermen
the
annual
harvest
hasnt
yet
begun
no
matter
ill
give
orders
to
make
for
the
gulf
of
mannar
and
well
arrive
there
late
tonight
the
captain
said
a
few
words
to
his
chief
officer
who
went
out
immediately
soon
the
nautilus
reentered
its
liquid
element
and
the
pressure
gauge
indicated
that
it
was
staying
at
a
depth
of
thirty
feet
with
the
chart
under
my
eyes
i
looked
for
the
gulf
of
mannar
i
found
it
by
the
9th
parallel
off
the
northwestern
shores
of
ceylon
it
was
formed
by
the
long
curve
of
little
mannar
island
to
reach
it
we
had
to
go
all
the
way
up
ceylons
west
coast
professor
captain
nemo
then
told
me
there
are
pearl
fisheries
in
the
bay
of
bengal
the
seas
of
the
east
indies
the
seas
of
china
and
japan
plus
those
seas
south
of
the
united
states
the
gulf
of
panama
and
the
gulf
of
california
but
its
off
ceylon
that
such
fishing
reaps
its
richest
rewards
no
doubt
well
be
arriving
a
little
early
fishermen
gather
in
the
gulf
of
mannar
only
during
the
month
of
march
and
for
thirty
days
some
300
boats
concentrate
on
the
lucrative
harvest
of
these
treasures
from
the
sea
each
boat
is
manned
by
ten
oarsmen
and
ten
fishermen
the
latter
divide
into
two
groups
dive
in
rotation
and
descend
to
a
depth
of
twelve
meters
with
the
help
of
a
heavy
stone
clutched
between
their
feet
and
attached
by
a
rope
to
their
boat
you
mean
i
said
that
such
primitive
methods
are
still
all
that
they
use
all
captain
nemo
answered
me
although
these
fisheries
belong
to
the
most
industrialized
people
in
the
world
the
english
to
whom
the
treaty
of
amiens
granted
them
in
1802
yet
it
strikes
me
that
diving
suits
like
yours
could
perform
yeoman
service
in
such
work
yes
since
those
poor
fishermen
cant
stay
long
underwater
on
his
voyage
to
ceylon
the
englishman
percival
made
much
of
a
kaffir
who
stayed
under
five
minutes
without
coming
up
to
the
surface
but
i
find
that
hard
to
believe
i
know
that
some
divers
can
last
up
to
fiftyseven
seconds
and
highly
skillful
ones
to
eightyseven
but
such
men
are
rare
and
when
the
poor
fellows
climb
back
on
board
the
water
coming
out
of
their
noses
and
ears
is
tinted
with
blood
i
believe
the
average
time
underwater
that
these
fishermen
can
tolerate
is
thirty
seconds
during
which
they
hastily
stuff
their
little
nets
with
all
the
pearl
oysters
they
can
tear
loose
but
these
fishermen
generally
dont
live
to
advanced
age
their
vision
weakens
ulcers
break
out
on
their
eyes
sores
form
on
their
bodies
and
some
are
even
stricken
with
apoplexy
on
the
ocean
floor
yes
i
said
its
a
sad
occupation
and
one
that
exists
only
to
gratify
the
whims
of
fashion
but
tell
me
captain
how
many
oysters
can
a
boat
fish
up
in
a
workday
about
40000
to
50000
its
even
said
that
in
1814
when
the
english
government
went
fishing
on
its
own
behalf
its
divers
worked
just
twenty
days
and
brought
up
76000000
oysters
at
least
i
asked
the
fishermen
are
well
paid
arent
they
hardly
professor
in
panama
they
make
just
100
per
week
in
most
places
they
earn
only
a
penny
for
each
oyster
that
has
a
pearl
and
they
bring
up
so
many
that
have
none
only
one
penny
to
those
poor
people
who
make
their
employers
rich
thats
atrocious
on
that
note
professor
captain
nemo
told
me
you
and
your
companions
will
visit
the
mannar
oysterbank
and
if
by
chance
some
eager
fisherman
arrives
early
well
we
can
watch
him
at
work
that
suits
me
captain
by
the
way
professor
aronnax
you
arent
afraid
of
sharks
are
you
sharks
i
exclaimed
this
struck
me
as
a
pretty
needless
question
to
say
the
least
well
captain
nemo
went
on
i
admit
captain
im
not
yet
on
very
familiar
terms
with
that
genus
of
fish
were
used
to
them
the
rest
of
us
captain
nemo
answered
and
in
time
you
will
be
too
anyhow
well
be
armed
and
on
our
way
we
might
hunt
a
maneater
or
two
its
a
fascinating
sport
so
professor
ill
see
you
tomorrow
bright
and
early
this
said
in
a
carefree
tone
captain
nemo
left
the
lounge
if
youre
invited
to
hunt
bears
in
the
swiss
mountains
you
might
say
oh
good
i
get
to
go
bear
hunting
tomorrow
if
youre
invited
to
hunt
lions
on
the
atlas
plains
or
tigers
in
the
jungles
of
india
you
might
say
ha
nows
my
chance
to
hunt
lions
and
tigers
but
if
youre
invited
to
hunt
sharks
in
their
native
element
you
might
want
to
think
it
over
before
accepting
as
for
me
i
passed
a
hand
over
my
brow
where
beads
of
cold
sweat
were
busy
forming
lets
think
this
over
i
said
to
myself
and
lets
take
our
time
hunting
otters
in
underwater
forests
as
we
did
in
the
forests
of
crespo
island
is
an
acceptable
activity
but
to
roam
the
bottom
of
the
sea
when
youre
almost
certain
to
meet
maneaters
in
the
neighborhood
thats
another
story
i
know
that
in
certain
countries
particularly
the
andaman
islands
negroes
dont
hesitate
to
attack
sharks
dagger
in
one
hand
and
noose
in
the
other
but
i
also
know
that
many
who
face
those
fearsome
animals
dont
come
back
alive
besides
im
not
a
negro
and
even
if
i
were
a
negro
in
this
instance
i
dont
think
a
little
hesitation
on
my
part
would
be
out
of
place
and
there
i
was
fantasizing
about
sharks
envisioning
huge
jaws
armed
with
multiple
rows
of
teeth
and
capable
of
cutting
a
man
in
half
i
could
already
feel
a
definite
pain
around
my
pelvic
girdle
and
how
i
resented
the
offhand
manner
in
which
the
captain
had
extended
his
deplorable
invitation
you
would
have
thought
it
was
an
issue
of
going
into
the
woods
on
some
harmless
fox
hunt
thank
heavens
i
said
to
myself
conseil
will
never
want
to
come
along
and
thatll
be
my
excuse
for
not
going
with
the
captain
as
for
ned
land
i
admit
i
felt
less
confident
of
his
wisdom
danger
however
great
held
a
perennial
attraction
for
his
aggressive
nature
i
went
back
to
reading
sirrs
book
but
i
leafed
through
it
mechanically
between
the
lines
i
kept
seeing
fearsome
wideopen
jaws
just
then
conseil
and
the
canadian
entered
with
a
calm
even
gleeful
air
little
did
they
know
what
was
waiting
for
them
ye
gods
sir
ned
land
told
me
your
captain
nemothe
devil
take
himhas
just
made
us
a
very
pleasant
proposition
oh
i
said
you
know
about
with
all
due
respect
to
master
conseil
replied
the
nautiluss
commander
has
invited
us
together
with
master
for
a
visit
tomorrow
to
ceylons
magnificent
pearl
fisheries
he
did
so
in
the
most
cordial
terms
and
conducted
himself
like
a
true
gentleman
he
didnt
tell
you
anything
else
nothing
sir
the
canadian
replied
he
said
youd
already
discussed
this
little
stroll
indeed
i
said
but
didnt
he
give
you
any
details
on
not
a
one
mr
naturalist
you
will
be
going
with
us
right
me
why
yes
certainly
of
course
i
can
see
that
you
like
the
idea
mr
land
yes
it
will
be
a
really
unusual
experience
and
possibly
dangerous
i
added
in
an
insinuating
tone
dangerous
ned
land
replied
a
simple
trip
to
an
oysterbank
assuredly
captain
nemo
hadnt
seen
fit
to
plant
the
idea
of
sharks
in
the
minds
of
my
companions
for
my
part
i
stared
at
them
with
anxious
eyes
as
if
they
were
already
missing
a
limb
or
two
should
i
alert
them
yes
surely
but
i
hardly
knew
how
to
go
about
it
would
master
conseil
said
to
me
give
us
some
background
on
pearl
fishing
on
the
fishing
itself
i
asked
or
on
the
occupational
hazards
that
on
the
fishing
the
canadian
replied
before
we
tackle
the
terrain
it
helps
to
be
familiar
with
it
all
right
sit
down
my
friends
and
ill
teach
you
everything
i
myself
have
just
been
taught
by
the
englishman
h
c
sirr
ned
and
conseil
took
seats
on
a
couch
and
right
off
the
canadian
said
to
me
sir
just
what
is
a
pearl
exactly
my
gallant
ned
i
replied
for
poets
a
pearl
is
a
tear
from
the
sea
for
orientals
its
a
drop
of
solidified
dew
for
the
ladies
its
a
jewel
they
can
wear
on
their
fingers
necks
and
ears
thats
oblong
in
shape
glassy
in
luster
and
formed
from
motherofpearl
for
chemists
its
a
mixture
of
calcium
phosphate
and
calcium
carbonate
with
a
little
gelatin
protein
and
finally
for
naturalists
its
a
simple
festering
secretion
from
the
organ
that
produces
motherofpearl
in
certain
bivalves
branch
mollusca
conseil
said
class
acephala
order
testacea
correct
my
scholarly
conseil
now
then
those
testacea
capable
of
producing
pearls
include
rainbow
abalone
turbo
snails
giant
clams
and
saltwater
scallopsbriefly
all
those
that
secrete
motherofpearl
in
other
words
that
blue
azure
violet
or
white
substance
lining
the
insides
of
their
valves
are
mussels
included
too
the
canadian
asked
yes
the
mussels
of
certain
streams
in
scotland
wales
ireland
saxony
bohemia
and
france
good
the
canadian
replied
from
now
on
well
pay
closer
attention
to
em
but
i
went
on
for
secreting
pearls
the
ideal
mollusk
is
the
pearl
oyster
meleagrina
margaritifera
that
valuable
shellfish
pearls
result
simply
from
motherofpearl
solidifying
into
a
globular
shape
either
they
stick
to
the
oysters
shell
or
they
become
embedded
in
the
creatures
folds
on
the
valves
a
pearl
sticks
fast
on
the
flesh
it
lies
loose
but
its
nucleus
is
always
some
small
hard
object
say
a
sterile
egg
or
a
grain
of
sand
around
which
the
motherofpearl
is
deposited
in
thin
concentric
layers
over
several
years
in
succession
can
one
find
several
pearls
in
the
same
oyster
conseil
asked
yes
my
boy
there
are
some
shellfish
that
turn
into
real
jewel
coffers
they
even
mention
one
oyster
about
which
i
remain
dubious
that
supposedly
contained
at
least
150
sharks
150
sharks
ned
land
yelped
did
i
say
sharks
i
exclaimed
hastily
i
meant
150
pearls
sharks
wouldnt
make
sense
indeed
conseil
said
but
will
master
now
tell
us
how
one
goes
about
extracting
these
pearls
one
proceeds
in
several
ways
and
often
when
pearls
stick
to
the
valves
fishermen
even
pull
them
loose
with
pliers
but
usually
the
shellfish
are
spread
out
on
mats
made
from
the
esparto
grass
that
covers
the
beaches
thus
they
die
in
the
open
air
and
by
the
end
of
ten
days
theyve
rotted
sufficiently
next
theyre
immersed
in
huge
tanks
of
salt
water
then
theyre
opened
up
and
washed
at
this
point
the
sorters
begin
their
twofold
task
first
they
remove
the
layers
of
motherofpearl
which
are
known
in
the
industry
by
the
names
legitimate
silver
bastard
white
or
bastard
black
and
these
are
shipped
out
in
cases
weighing
125
to
150
kilograms
then
they
remove
the
oysters
meaty
tissue
boil
it
and
finally
strain
it
in
order
to
extract
even
the
smallest
pearls
do
the
prices
of
these
pearls
differ
depending
on
their
size
conseil
asked
not
only
on
their
size
i
replied
but
also
according
to
their
shape
their
waterin
other
words
their
colorand
their
orientin
other
words
that
dappled
shimmering
glow
that
makes
them
so
delightful
to
the
eye
the
finest
pearls
are
called
virgin
pearls
or
paragons
they
form
in
isolation
within
the
mollusks
tissue
theyre
white
often
opaque
but
sometimes
of
opalescent
transparency
and
usually
spherical
or
pearshaped
the
spherical
ones
are
made
into
bracelets
the
pearshaped
ones
into
earrings
and
since
theyre
the
most
valuable
theyre
priced
individually
the
other
pearls
that
stick
to
the
oysters
shell
are
more
erratically
shaped
and
are
priced
by
weight
finally
classed
in
the
lowest
order
the
smallest
pearls
are
known
by
the
name
seed
pearls
theyre
priced
by
the
measuring
cup
and
are
used
mainly
in
the
creation
of
embroidery
for
church
vestments
but
it
must
be
a
long
hard
job
sorting
out
these
pearls
by
size
the
canadian
said
no
my
friend
that
task
is
performed
with
eleven
strainers
or
sieves
that
are
pierced
with
different
numbers
of
holes
those
pearls
staying
in
the
strainers
with
twenty
to
eighty
holes
are
in
the
first
order
those
not
slipping
through
the
sieves
pierced
with
100
to
800
holes
are
in
the
second
order
finally
those
pearls
for
which
one
uses
strainers
pierced
with
900
to
1000
holes
make
up
the
seed
pearls
how
ingenious
conseil
said
to
reduce
dividing
and
classifying
pearls
to
a
mechanical
operation
and
could
master
tell
us
the
profits
brought
in
by
harvesting
these
banks
of
pearl
oysters
according
to
sirrs
book
i
replied
these
ceylon
fisheries
are
farmed
annually
for
a
total
profit
of
3000000
maneaters
francs
conseil
rebuked
yes
francs
3000000
francs
i
went
on
but
i
dont
think
these
fisheries
bring
in
the
returns
they
once
did
similarly
the
central
american
fisheries
used
to
make
an
annual
profit
of
4000000
francs
during
the
reign
of
king
charles
v
but
now
they
bring
in
only
twothirds
of
that
amount
all
in
all
its
estimated
that
9000000
francs
is
the
current
yearly
return
for
the
whole
pearlharvesting
industry
but
conseil
asked
havent
certain
famous
pearls
been
quoted
at
extremely
high
prices
yes
my
boy
they
say
julius
caesar
gave
servilia
a
pearl
worth
120000
francs
in
our
currency
ive
even
heard
stories
the
canadian
said
about
some
lady
in
ancient
times
who
drank
pearls
in
vinegar
cleopatra
conseil
shot
back
it
must
have
tasted
pretty
bad
ned
land
added
abominable
ned
my
friend
conseil
replied
but
when
a
little
glass
of
vinegar
is
worth
1500000
francs
its
taste
is
a
small
price
to
pay
im
sorry
i
didnt
marry
the
gal
the
canadian
said
throwing
up
his
hands
with
an
air
of
discouragement
ned
land
married
to
cleopatra
conseil
exclaimed
but
i
was
all
set
to
tie
the
knot
conseil
the
canadian
replied
in
all
seriousness
and
it
wasnt
my
fault
the
whole
business
fell
through
i
even
bought
a
pearl
necklace
for
my
fiance
kate
tender
but
she
married
somebody
else
instead
well
that
necklace
cost
me
only
150
but
you
can
absolutely
trust
me
on
this
professor
its
pearls
were
so
big
they
wouldnt
have
gone
through
that
strainer
with
twenty
holes
my
gallant
ned
i
replied
laughing
those
were
artificial
pearls
ordinary
glass
beads
whose
insides
were
coated
with
essence
of
orient
wow
the
canadian
replied
that
essence
of
orient
must
sell
for
quite
a
large
sum
as
little
as
zero
it
comes
from
the
scales
of
a
european
carp
its
nothing
more
than
a
silver
substance
that
collects
in
the
water
and
is
preserved
in
ammonia
its
worthless
maybe
thats
why
kate
tender
married
somebody
else
replied
mr
land
philosophically
but
i
said
getting
back
to
pearls
of
great
value
i
dont
think
any
sovereign
ever
possessed
one
superior
to
the
pearl
owned
by
captain
nemo
this
one
conseil
said
pointing
to
a
magnificent
jewel
in
its
glass
case
exactly
and
im
certainly
not
far
off
when
i
estimate
its
value
at
2000000



uh



francs
conseil
said
quickly
yes
i
said
2000000
francs
and
no
doubt
all
it
cost
our
captain
was
the
effort
to
pick
it
up
ha
ned
land
exclaimed
during
our
stroll
tomorrow
who
says
we
wont
run
into
one
just
like
it
bah
conseil
put
in
and
why
not
what
good
would
a
pearl
worth
millions
do
us
here
on
the
nautilus
here
no
ned
land
said
but
elsewhere



oh
elsewhere
conseil
put
in
shaking
his
head
in
fact
i
said
mr
land
is
right
and
if
we
ever
brought
back
to
europe
or
america
a
pearl
worth
millions
it
would
make
the
story
of
our
adventures
more
authenticand
much
more
rewarding
thats
how
i
see
it
the
canadian
said
but
said
conseil
who
perpetually
returned
to
the
didactic
side
of
things
is
this
pearl
fishing
ever
dangerous
no
i
replied
quickly
especially
if
one
takes
certain
precautions
what
risks
would
you
run
in
a
job
like
that
ned
land
said
swallowing
a
few
gulps
of
salt
water
whatever
you
say
ned
then
trying
to
imitate
captain
nemos
carefree
tone
i
asked
by
the
way
gallant
ned
are
you
afraid
of
sharks
me
the
canadian
replied
im
a
professional
harpooner
its
my
job
to
make
a
mockery
of
them
it
isnt
an
issue
i
said
of
fishing
for
them
with
a
swivel
hook
hoisting
them
onto
the
deck
of
a
ship
chopping
off
the
tail
with
a
sweep
of
the
ax
opening
the
belly
ripping
out
the
heart
and
tossing
it
into
the
sea
so
its
an
issue
of




yes
precisely
in
the
water
in
the
water
ye
gods
just
give
me
a
good
harpoon
you
see
sir
these
sharks
are
badly
designed
they
have
to
roll
their
bellies
over
to
snap
you
up
and
in
the
meantime



ned
land
had
a
way
of
pronouncing
the
word
snap
that
sent
chills
down
the
spine
well
how
about
you
conseil
what
are
your
feelings
about
these
maneaters
me
conseil
said
im
afraid
i
must
be
frank
with
master

night
fell
i
went
to
bed
i
slept
pretty
poorly
maneaters
played
a
major
role
in
my
dreams
and
i
found
it
more
or
less
appropriate
that
the
french
word
for
shark
requin
has
its
linguistic
roots
in
the
word
requiem
the
next
day
at
four
oclock
in
the
morning
i
was
awakened
by
the
steward
whom
captain
nemo
had
placed
expressly
at
my
service
i
got
up
quickly
dressed
and
went
into
the
lounge
captain
nemo
was
waiting
for
me
professor
aronnax
he
said
to
me
are
you
ready
to
start
im
ready
kindly
follow
me
what
about
my
companions
captain
theyve
been
alerted
and
are
waiting
for
us
arent
we
going
to
put
on
our
diving
suits
i
asked
not
yet
i
havent
let
the
nautilus
pull
too
near
the
coast
and
were
fairly
well
out
from
the
mannar
oysterbank
but
i
have
the
skiff
ready
and
it
will
take
us
to
the
exact
spot
where
well
disembark
which
will
save
us
a
pretty
long
trek
its
carrying
our
diving
equipment
and
well
suit
up
just
before
we
begin
our
underwater
exploring
captain
nemo
took
me
to
the
central
companionway
whose
steps
led
to
the
platform
ned
and
conseil
were
there
enraptured
with
the
pleasure
trip
getting
under
way
oars
in
position
five
of
the
nautiluss
sailors
were
waiting
for
us
aboard
the
skiff
which
was
moored
alongside
the
night
was
still
dark
layers
of
clouds
cloaked
the
sky
and
left
only
a
few
stars
in
view
my
eyes
flew
to
the
side
where
land
lay
but
i
saw
only
a
blurred
line
covering
threequarters
of
the
horizon
from
southwest
to
northwest
going
up
ceylons
west
coast
during
the
night
the
nautilus
lay
west
of
the
bay
or
rather
that
gulf
formed
by
the
mainland
and
mannar
island
under
these
dark
waters
there
stretched
the
bank
of
shellfish
an
inexhaustible
field
of
pearls
more
than
twenty
miles
long
captain
nemo
conseil
ned
land
and
i
found
seats
in
the
stern
of
the
skiff
the
longboats
coxswain
took
the
tiller
his
four
companions
leaned
into
their
oars
the
moorings
were
cast
off
and
we
pulled
clear
the
skiff
headed
southward
the
oarsmen
took
their
time
i
watched
their
strokes
vigorously
catch
the
water
and
they
always
waited
ten
seconds
before
rowing
again
following
the
practice
used
in
most
navies
while
the
longboat
coasted
drops
of
liquid
flicked
from
the
oars
and
hit
the
dark
troughs
of
the
waves
pitterpattering
like
splashes
of
molten
lead
coming
from
well
out
a
mild
swell
made
the
skiff
roll
gently
and
a
few
cresting
billows
lapped
at
its
bow
we
were
silent
what
was
captain
nemo
thinking
perhaps
that
this
approaching
shore
was
too
close
for
comfort
contrary
to
the
canadians
views
in
which
it
still
seemed
too
far
away
as
for
conseil
he
had
come
along
out
of
simple
curiosity
near
530
the
first
glimmers
of
light
on
the
horizon
defined
the
upper
lines
of
the
coast
with
greater
distinctness
fairly
flat
to
the
east
it
swelled
a
little
toward
the
south
five
miles
still
separated
it
from
us
and
its
beach
merged
with
the
misty
waters
between
us
and
the
shore
the
sea
was
deserted
not
a
boat
not
a
diver
profound
solitude
reigned
over
this
gathering
place
of
pearl
fishermen
as
captain
nemo
had
commented
we
were
arriving
in
these
waterways
a
month
too
soon
at
six
oclock
the
day
broke
suddenly
with
that
speed
unique
to
tropical
regions
which
experience
no
real
dawn
or
dusk
the
suns
rays
pierced
the
cloud
curtain
gathered
on
the
easterly
horizon
and
the
radiant
orb
rose
swiftly
i
could
clearly
see
the
shore
which
featured
a
few
sparse
trees
here
and
there
the
skiff
advanced
toward
mannar
island
which
curved
to
the
south
captain
nemo
stood
up
from
his
thwart
and
studied
the
sea
at
his
signal
the
anchor
was
lowered
but
its
chain
barely
ran
because
the
bottom
lay
no
more
than
a
meter
down
and
this
locality
was
one
of
the
shallowest
spots
near
the
bank
of
shellfish
instantly
the
skiff
wheeled
around
under
the
ebb
tides
outbound
thrust
here
we
are
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
then
said
you
observe
this
confined
bay
a
month
from
now
in
this
very
place
the
numerous
fishing
boats
of
the
harvesters
will
gather
and
these
are
the
waters
their
divers
will
ransack
so
daringly
this
bay
is
felicitously
laid
out
for
their
type
of
fishing
its
sheltered
from
the
strongest
winds
and
the
sea
is
never
very
turbulent
here
highly
favorable
conditions
for
diving
work
now
lets
put
on
our
underwater
suits
and
well
begin
our
stroll
i
didnt
reply
and
while
staring
at
these
suspicious
waves
i
began
to
put
on
my
heavy
aquatic
clothes
helped
by
the
longboats
sailors
captain
nemo
and
my
two
companions
suited
up
as
well
none
of
the
nautiluss
men
were
to
go
with
us
on
this
new
excursion
soon
we
were
imprisoned
up
to
the
neck
in
indiarubber
clothing
and
straps
fastened
the
air
devices
onto
our
backs
as
for
the
ruhmkorff
device
it
didnt
seem
to
be
in
the
picture
before
inserting
my
head
into
its
copper
capsule
i
commented
on
this
to
the
captain
our
lighting
equipment
would
be
useless
to
us
the
captain
answered
me
we
wont
be
going
very
deep
and
the
suns
rays
will
be
sufficient
to
light
our
way
besides
its
unwise
to
carry
electric
lanterns
under
these
waves
their
brightness
might
unexpectedly
attract
certain
dangerous
occupants
of
these
waterways
as
captain
nemo
pronounced
these
words
i
turned
to
conseil
and
ned
land
but
my
two
friends
had
already
encased
their
craniums
in
their
metal
headgear
and
they
could
neither
hear
nor
reply
i
had
one
question
left
to
address
to
captain
nemo
what
about
our
weapons
i
asked
him
our
rifles
rifles
what
for
dont
your
mountaineers
attack
bears
dagger
in
hand
and
isnt
steel
surer
than
lead
heres
a
sturdy
blade
slip
it
under
your
belt
and
lets
be
off
i
stared
at
my
companions
they
were
armed
in
the
same
fashion
and
ned
land
was
also
brandishing
an
enormous
harpoon
he
had
stowed
in
the
skiff
before
leaving
the
nautilus
then
following
the
captains
example
i
let
myself
be
crowned
with
my
heavy
copper
sphere
and
our
air
tanks
immediately
went
into
action
an
instant
later
the
longboats
sailors
helped
us
overboard
one
after
the
other
and
we
set
foot
on
level
sand
in
a
meter
and
a
half
of
water
captain
nemo
gave
us
a
hand
signal
we
followed
him
down
a
gentle
slope
and
disappeared
under
the
waves
there
the
obsessive
fears
in
my
brain
left
me
i
became
surprisingly
calm
again
the
ease
with
which
i
could
move
increased
my
confidence
and
the
many
strange
sights
captivated
my
imagination
the
sun
was
already
sending
sufficient
light
under
these
waves
the
tiniest
objects
remained
visible
after
ten
minutes
of
walking
we
were
in
five
meters
of
water
and
the
terrain
had
become
almost
flat
like
a
covey
of
snipe
over
a
marsh
there
rose
underfoot
schools
of
unusual
fish
from
the
genus
monopterus
whose
members
have
no
fin
but
their
tail
i
recognized
the
javanese
eel
a
genuine
eightdecimeter
serpent
with
a
bluish
gray
belly
which
without
the
gold
lines
over
its
flanks
could
easily
be
confused
with
the
conger
eel
from
the
butterfish
genus
whose
oval
bodies
are
very
flat
i
observed
several
adorned
in
brilliant
colors
and
sporting
a
dorsal
fin
like
a
sickle
edible
fish
that
when
dried
and
marinated
make
an
excellent
dish
known
by
the
name
karawade
then
some
sea
poachers
fish
belonging
to
the
genus
aspidophoroides
whose
bodies
are
covered
with
scaly
armor
divided
into
eight
lengthwise
sections
meanwhile
as
the
sun
got
progressively
higher
it
lit
up
the
watery
mass
more
and
more
the
seafloor
changed
little
by
little
its
finegrained
sand
was
followed
by
a
genuine
causeway
of
smooth
crags
covered
by
a
carpet
of
mollusks
and
zoophytes
among
other
specimens
in
these
two
branches
i
noted
some
windowpane
oysters
with
thin
valves
of
unequal
size
a
type
of
ostracod
unique
to
the
red
sea
and
the
indian
ocean
then
orangehued
lucina
with
circular
shells
awlshaped
auger
shells
some
of
those
persian
murex
snails
that
supply
the
nautilus
with
such
wonderful
dye
spiky
periwinkles
fifteen
centimeters
long
that
rose
under
the
waves
like
hands
ready
to
grab
you
turban
snails
with
shells
made
of
horn
and
bristling
all
over
with
spines
lamp
shells
edible
duck
clams
that
feed
the
hindu
marketplace
subtly
luminous
jellyfish
of
the
species
pelagia
panopyra
and
finally
some
wonderful
oculina
flabelliforma
magnificent
sea
fans
that
fashion
one
of
the
most
luxuriant
tree
forms
in
this
ocean
in
the
midst
of
this
moving
vegetation
under
arbors
of
water
plants
there
raced
legions
of
clumsy
articulates
in
particular
some
fanged
frog
crabs
whose
carapaces
form
a
slightly
rounded
triangle
robber
crabs
exclusive
to
these
waterways
and
horrible
parthenope
crabs
whose
appearance
was
repulsive
to
the
eye
one
animal
no
less
hideous
which
i
encountered
several
times
was
the
enormous
crab
that
mr
darwin
observed
to
which
nature
has
given
the
instinct
and
requisite
strength
to
eat
coconuts
it
scrambles
up
trees
on
the
beach
and
sends
the
coconuts
tumbling
they
fracture
in
their
fall
and
are
opened
by
its
powerful
pincers
here
under
these
clear
waves
this
crab
raced
around
with
matchless
agility
while
green
turtles
from
the
species
frequenting
the
malabar
coast
moved
sluggishly
among
the
crumbling
rocks
near
seven
oclock
we
finally
surveyed
the
bank
of
shellfish
where
pearl
oysters
reproduce
by
the
millions
these
valuable
mollusks
stick
to
rocks
where
theyre
strongly
attached
by
a
mass
of
brown
filaments
that
forbids
their
moving
about
in
this
respect
oysters
are
inferior
even
to
mussels
to
whom
nature
has
not
denied
all
talent
for
locomotion
the
shellfish
meleagrina
that
womb
for
pearls
whose
valves
are
nearly
equal
in
size
has
the
shape
of
a
round
shell
with
thick
walls
and
a
very
rough
exterior
some
of
these
shells
were
furrowed
with
flaky
greenish
bands
that
radiated
down
from
the
top
these
were
the
young
oysters
the
others
had
rugged
black
surfaces
measured
up
to
fifteen
centimeters
in
width
and
were
ten
or
more
years
old
captain
nemo
pointed
to
this
prodigious
heap
of
shellfish
and
i
saw
that
these
mines
were
genuinely
inexhaustible
since
natures
creative
powers
are
greater
than
mans
destructive
instincts
true
to
those
instincts
ned
land
greedily
stuffed
the
finest
of
these
mollusks
into
a
net
he
carried
at
his
side
but
we
couldnt
stop
we
had
to
follow
the
captain
who
headed
down
trails
seemingly
known
only
to
himself
the
seafloor
rose
noticeably
and
when
i
lifted
my
arms
sometimes
they
would
pass
above
the
surface
of
the
sea
then
the
level
of
the
oysterbank
would
lower
unpredictably
often
we
went
around
tall
pointed
rocks
rising
like
pyramids
in
their
dark
crevices
huge
crustaceans
aiming
their
long
legs
like
heavy
artillery
watched
us
with
unblinking
eyes
while
underfoot
there
crept
millipedes
bloodworms
aricia
worms
and
annelid
worms
whose
antennas
and
tubular
tentacles
were
incredibly
long
just
then
a
huge
cave
opened
up
in
our
path
hollowed
from
a
picturesque
pile
of
rocks
whose
smooth
heights
were
completely
hung
with
underwater
flora
at
first
this
cave
looked
pitchblack
to
me
inside
the
suns
rays
seemed
to
diminish
by
degrees
their
hazy
transparency
was
nothing
more
than
drowned
light
captain
nemo
went
in
we
followed
him
my
eyes
soon
grew
accustomed
to
this
comparative
gloom
i
distinguished
the
unpredictably
contoured
springings
of
a
vault
supported
by
natural
pillars
firmly
based
on
a
granite
foundation
like
the
weighty
columns
of
tuscan
architecture
why
had
our
incomprehensible
guide
taken
us
into
the
depths
of
this
underwater
crypt
i
would
soon
find
out
after
going
down
a
fairly
steep
slope
our
feet
trod
the
floor
of
a
sort
of
circular
pit
there
captain
nemo
stopped
and
his
hand
indicated
an
object
that
i
hadnt
yet
noticed
it
was
an
oyster
of
extraordinary
dimensions
a
titanic
giant
clam
a
holywater
font
that
could
have
held
a
whole
lake
a
basin
more
than
two
meters
wide
hence
even
bigger
than
the
one
adorning
the
nautiluss
lounge
i
approached
this
phenomenal
mollusk
its
mass
of
filaments
attached
it
to
a
table
of
granite
and
there
it
grew
by
itself
in
the
midst
of
the
caves
calm
waters
i
estimated
the
weight
of
this
giant
clam
at
300
kilograms
hence
such
an
oyster
held
fifteen
kilos
of
meat
and
youd
need
the
stomach
of
king
gargantua
to
eat
a
couple
dozen
captain
nemo
was
obviously
familiar
with
this
bivalves
existence
this
wasnt
the
first
time
hed
paid
it
a
visit
and
i
thought
his
sole
reason
for
leading
us
to
this
locality
was
to
show
us
a
natural
curiosity
i
was
mistaken
captain
nemo
had
an
explicit
personal
interest
in
checking
on
the
current
condition
of
this
giant
clam
the
mollusks
two
valves
were
partly
open
the
captain
approached
and
stuck
his
dagger
vertically
between
the
shells
to
discourage
any
ideas
about
closing
then
with
his
hands
he
raised
the
fringed
membranefilled
tunic
that
made
up
the
animals
mantle
there
between
its
leaflike
folds
i
saw
a
loose
pearl
as
big
as
a
coconut
its
globular
shape
perfect
clarity
and
wonderful
orient
made
it
a
jewel
of
incalculable
value
carried
away
by
curiosity
i
stretched
out
my
hand
to
take
it
weigh
it
fondle
it
but
the
captain
stopped
me
signaled
no
removed
his
dagger
in
one
swift
motion
and
let
the
two
valves
snap
shut
i
then
understood
captain
nemos
intent
by
leaving
the
pearl
buried
beneath
the
giant
clams
mantle
he
allowed
it
to
grow
imperceptibly
with
each
passing
year
the
mollusks
secretions
added
new
concentric
layers
the
captain
alone
was
familiar
with
the
cave
where
this
wonderful
fruit
of
nature
was
ripening
he
alone
reared
it
so
to
speak
in
order
to
transfer
it
one
day
to
his
dearly
beloved
museum
perhaps
following
the
examples
of
oyster
farmers
in
china
and
india
he
had
even
predetermined
the
creation
of
this
pearl
by
sticking
under
the
mollusks
folds
some
piece
of
glass
or
metal
that
was
gradually
covered
with
motherofpearl
in
any
case
comparing
this
pearl
to
others
i
already
knew
about
and
to
those
shimmering
in
the
captains
collection
i
estimated
that
it
was
worth
at
least
10000000
francs
it
was
a
superb
natural
curiosity
rather
than
a
luxurious
piece
of
jewelry
because
i
dont
know
of
any
female
ear
that
could
handle
it
our
visit
to
this
opulent
giant
clam
came
to
an
end
captain
nemo
left
the
cave
and
we
climbed
back
up
the
bank
of
shellfish
in
the
midst
of
these
clear
waters
not
yet
disturbed
by
divers
at
work
we
walked
by
ourselves
genuine
loiterers
stopping
or
straying
as
our
fancies
dictated
for
my
part
i
was
no
longer
worried
about
those
dangers
my
imagination
had
so
ridiculously
exaggerated
the
shallows
drew
noticeably
closer
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
soon
walking
in
only
a
meter
of
water
my
head
passed
well
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
conseil
rejoined
me
and
gluing
his
huge
copper
capsule
to
mine
his
eyes
gave
me
a
friendly
greeting
but
this
lofty
plateau
measured
only
a
few
fathoms
and
soon
we
reentered
our
element
i
think
ive
now
earned
the
right
to
dub
it
that
ten
minutes
later
captain
nemo
stopped
suddenly
i
thought
hed
called
a
halt
so
that
we
could
turn
and
start
back
no
with
a
gesture
he
ordered
us
to
crouch
beside
him
at
the
foot
of
a
wide
crevice
his
hand
motioned
toward
a
spot
within
the
liquid
mass
and
i
looked
carefully
five
meters
away
a
shadow
appeared
and
dropped
to
the
seafloor
the
alarming
idea
of
sharks
crossed
my
mind
but
i
was
mistaken
and
once
again
we
didnt
have
to
deal
with
monsters
of
the
deep
it
was
a
man
a
living
man
a
black
indian
fisherman
a
poor
devil
who
no
doubt
had
come
to
gather
what
he
could
before
harvest
time
i
saw
the
bottom
of
his
dinghy
moored
a
few
feet
above
his
head
he
would
dive
and
go
back
up
in
quick
succession
a
stone
cut
in
the
shape
of
a
sugar
loaf
which
he
gripped
between
his
feet
while
a
rope
connected
it
to
his
boat
served
to
lower
him
more
quickly
to
the
ocean
floor
this
was
the
extent
of
his
equipment
arriving
on
the
seafloor
at
a
depth
of
about
five
meters
he
fell
to
his
knees
and
stuffed
his
sack
with
shellfish
gathered
at
random
then
he
went
back
up
emptied
his
sack
pulled
up
his
stone
and
started
all
over
again
the
whole
process
lasting
only
thirty
seconds
this
diver
didnt
see
us
a
shadow
cast
by
our
crag
hid
us
from
his
view
and
besides
how
could
this
poor
indian
ever
have
guessed
that
human
beings
creatures
like
himself
were
near
him
under
the
waters
eavesdropping
on
his
movements
not
missing
a
single
detail
of
his
fishing
so
he
went
up
and
down
several
times
he
gathered
only
about
ten
shellfish
per
dive
because
he
had
to
tear
them
from
the
banks
where
each
clung
with
its
tough
mass
of
filaments
and
how
many
of
these
oysters
for
which
he
risked
his
life
would
have
no
pearl
in
them
i
observed
him
with
great
care
his
movements
were
systematically
executed
and
for
half
an
hour
no
danger
seemed
to
threaten
him
so
i
had
gotten
used
to
the
sight
of
this
fascinating
fishing
when
all
at
once
just
as
the
indian
was
kneeling
on
the
seafloor
i
saw
him
make
a
frightened
gesture
stand
and
gather
himself
to
spring
back
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
i
understood
his
fear
a
gigantic
shadow
appeared
above
the
poor
diver
it
was
a
shark
of
huge
size
moving
in
diagonally
eyes
ablaze
jaws
wide
open
i
was
speechless
with
horror
unable
to
make
a
single
movement
with
one
vigorous
stroke
of
its
fins
the
voracious
animal
shot
toward
the
indian
who
jumped
aside
and
avoided
the
sharks
bite
but
not
the
thrashing
of
its
tail
because
that
tail
struck
him
across
the
chest
and
stretched
him
out
on
the
seafloor
this
scene
lasted
barely
a
few
seconds
the
shark
returned
rolled
over
on
its
back
and
was
getting
ready
to
cut
the
indian
in
half
when
captain
nemo
who
was
stationed
beside
me
suddenly
stood
up
then
he
strode
right
toward
the
monster
dagger
in
hand
ready
to
fight
it
at
close
quarters
just
as
it
was
about
to
snap
up
the
poor
fisherman
the
maneater
saw
its
new
adversary
repositioned
itself
on
its
belly
and
headed
swiftly
toward
him
i
can
see
captain
nemos
bearing
to
this
day
bracing
himself
he
waited
for
the
fearsome
maneater
with
wonderful
composure
and
when
the
latter
rushed
at
him
the
captain
leaped
aside
with
prodigious
quickness
avoided
a
collision
and
sank
his
dagger
into
its
belly
but
that
wasnt
the
end
of
the
story
a
dreadful
battle
was
joined
the
shark
bellowed
so
to
speak
blood
was
pouring
into
the
waves
from
its
wounds
the
sea
was
dyed
red
and
through
this
opaque
liquid
i
could
see
nothing
else
nothing
else
until
the
moment
when
through
a
rift
in
the
clouds
i
saw
the
daring
captain
clinging
to
one
of
the
animals
fins
fighting
the
monster
at
close
quarters
belaboring
his
enemys
belly
with
stabs
of
the
dagger
yet
unable
to
deliver
the
deciding
thrust
in
other
words
a
direct
hit
to
the
heart
in
its
struggles
the
maneater
churned
the
watery
mass
so
furiously
its
eddies
threatened
to
knock
me
over
i
wanted
to
run
to
the
captains
rescue
but
i
was
transfixed
with
horror
unable
to
move
i
stared
wildeyed
i
saw
the
fight
enter
a
new
phase
the
captain
fell
to
the
seafloor
toppled
by
the
enormous
mass
weighing
him
down
then
the
sharks
jaws
opened
astoundingly
wide
like
a
pair
of
industrial
shears
and
that
would
have
been
the
finish
of
captain
nemo
had
not
ned
land
quick
as
thought
rushed
forward
with
his
harpoon
and
driven
its
dreadful
point
into
the
sharks
underside
the
waves
were
saturated
with
masses
of
blood
the
waters
shook
with
the
movements
of
the
maneater
which
thrashed
about
with
indescribable
fury
ned
land
hadnt
missed
his
target
this
was
the
monsters
death
rattle
pierced
to
the
heart
it
was
struggling
with
dreadful
spasms
whose
aftershocks
knocked
conseil
off
his
feet
meanwhile
ned
land
pulled
the
captain
clear
uninjured
the
latter
stood
up
went
right
to
the
indian
quickly
cut
the
rope
binding
the
man
to
his
stone
took
the
fellow
in
his
arms
and
with
a
vigorous
kick
of
the
heel
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
three
of
us
followed
him
and
a
few
moments
later
miraculously
safe
we
reached
the
fishermans
longboat
captain
nemos
first
concern
was
to
revive
this
unfortunate
man
i
wasnt
sure
he
would
succeed
i
hoped
so
since
the
poor
devil
hadnt
been
under
very
long
but
that
stroke
from
the
sharks
tail
could
have
been
his
deathblow
fortunately
after
vigorous
massaging
by
conseil
and
the
captain
i
saw
the
nearly
drowned
man
regain
consciousness
little
by
little
he
opened
his
eyes
how
startled
he
must
have
felt
how
frightened
even
at
seeing
four
huge
copper
craniums
leaning
over
him
and
above
all
what
must
he
have
thought
when
captain
nemo
pulled
a
bag
of
pearls
from
a
pocket
in
his
diving
suit
and
placed
it
in
the
fishermans
hands
this
magnificent
benefaction
from
the
man
of
the
waters
to
the
poor
indian
from
ceylon
was
accepted
by
the
latter
with
trembling
hands
his
bewildered
eyes
indicated
that
he
didnt
know
to
what
superhuman
creatures
he
owed
both
his
life
and
his
fortune
at
the
captains
signal
we
returned
to
the
bank
of
shellfish
and
retracing
our
steps
we
walked
for
half
an
hour
until
we
encountered
the
anchor
connecting
the
seafloor
with
the
nautiluss
skiff
back
on
board
the
sailors
helped
divest
us
of
our
heavy
copper
carapaces
captain
nemos
first
words
were
spoken
to
the
canadian
thank
you
mr
land
he
told
him
tit
for
tat
captain
ned
land
replied
i
owed
it
to
you
the
ghost
of
a
smile
glided
across
the
captains
lips
and
that
was
all
to
the
nautilus
he
said
the
longboat
flew
over
the
waves
a
few
minutes
later
we
encountered
the
sharks
corpse
again
floating
from
the
black
markings
on
the
tips
of
its
fins
i
recognized
the
dreadful
squalus
melanopterus
from
the
seas
of
the
east
indies
a
variety
in
the
species
of
sharks
proper
it
was
more
than
twentyfive
feet
long
its
enormous
mouth
occupied
a
third
of
its
body
it
was
an
adult
as
could
be
seen
from
the
six
rows
of
teeth
forming
an
isosceles
triangle
in
its
upper
jaw
conseil
looked
at
it
with
purely
scientific
fascination
and
im
sure
he
placed
it
not
without
good
reason
in
the
class
of
cartilaginous
fish
order
chondropterygia
with
fixed
gills
family
selacia
genus
squalus
while
i
was
contemplating
this
inert
mass
suddenly
a
dozen
of
these
voracious
melanoptera
appeared
around
our
longboat
but
paying
no
attention
to
us
they
pounced
on
the
corpse
and
quarreled
over
every
scrap
of
it
by
830
we
were
back
on
board
the
nautilus
there
i
fell
to
thinking
about
the
incidents
that
marked
our
excursion
over
the
mannar
oysterbank
two
impressions
inevitably
stood
out
one
concerned
captain
nemos
matchless
bravery
the
other
his
devotion
to
a
human
being
a
representative
of
that
race
from
which
he
had
fled
beneath
the
seas
in
spite
of
everything
this
strange
man
hadnt
yet
succeeded
in
completely
stifling
his
heart
when
i
shared
these
impressions
with
him
he
answered
me
in
a
tone
touched
with
emotion

in
the
land
of
the
oppressed
and
i
am
to
this
day
and
will

my

breath

chapter

the
red
sea
during
the
day
of
january
29
the
island
of
ceylon
disappeared
below
the
horizon
and
at
a
speed
of
twenty
miles
per
hour
the
nautilus
glided
into
the
labyrinthine
channels
that
separate
the
maldive
and
laccadive
islands
it
likewise
hugged
kiltan
island
a
shore
of
madreporic
origin
discovered
by
vasco
da
gama
in
1499
and
one
of
nineteen
chief
islands
in
the
island
group
of
the
laccadives
located
between
latitude
10
degrees
and
14
degrees
30
north
and
between
longitude
50
degrees
72
and
69
degrees
east
by
then
we
had
fared
16220
miles
or
7500
leagues
from
our
starting
point
in
the
seas
of
japan
the
next
day
january
30
when
the
nautilus
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
there
was
no
more
land
in
sight
setting
its
course
to
the
northnorthwest
the
ship
headed
toward
the
gulf
of
oman
carved
out
between
arabia
and
the
indian
peninsula
and
providing
access
to
the
persian
gulf
this
was
obviously
a
blind
alley
with
no
possible
outlet
so
where
was
captain
nemo
taking
us
i
was
unable
to
say
which
didnt
satisfy
the
canadian
who
that
day
asked
me
where
we
were
going
were
going
mr
ned
where
the
captains
fancy
takes
us
his
fancy
the
canadian
replied
wont
take
us
very
far
the
persian
gulf
has
no
outlet
and
if
we
enter
those
waters
it
wont
be
long
before
we
return
in
our
tracks
all
right
well
return
mr
land
and
after
the
persian
gulf
if
the
nautilus
wants
to
visit
the
red
sea
the
strait
of
bab
el
mandeb
is
still
there
to
let
us
in
i
dont
have
to
tell
you
sir
ned
land
replied
that
the
red
sea
is
just
as
landlocked
as
the
gulf
since
the
isthmus
of
suez
hasnt
been
cut
all
the
way
through
yet
and
even
if
it
was
a
boat
as
secretive
as
ours
wouldnt
risk
a
canal
intersected
with
locks
so
the
red
sea
wont
be
our
way
back
to
europe
either
but
i
didnt
say
wed
return
to
europe
what
do
you
figure
then
i
figure
that
after
visiting
these
unusual
waterways
of
arabia
and
egypt
the
nautilus
will
go
back
down
to
the
indian
ocean
perhaps
through
mozambique
channel
perhaps
off
the
mascarene
islands
and
then
make
for
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
once
were
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
canadian
asked
with
typical
persistence
well
then
well
enter
that
atlantic
ocean
with
which
we
arent
yet
familiar
whats
wrong
ned
my
friend
are
you
tired
of
this
voyage
under
the
seas
are
you
bored
with
the
constantly
changing
sight
of
these
underwater
wonders
speaking
for
myself
ill
be
extremely
distressed
to
see
the
end
of
a
voyage
so
few
men
will
ever
have
a
chance
to
make
but
dont
you
realize
professor
aronnax
the
canadian
replied
that
soon
well
have
been
imprisoned
for
three
whole
months
aboard
this
nautilus
no
ned
i
didnt
realize
it
i
dont
want
to
realize
it
and
i
dont
keep
track
of
every
day
and
every
hour
but
when
will
it
be
over
in
its
appointed
time
meanwhile
theres
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
and
our
discussions
are
futile
my
gallant
ned
if
you
come
and
tell
me
a
chance
to
escape
is
available
to
us
then
ill
discuss
it
with
you
but
that
isnt
the
case
and
in
all
honesty
i
dont
think
captain
nemo
ever
ventures
into
european
seas
this
short
dialogue
reveals
that
in
my
mania
for
the
nautilus
i
was
turning
into
the
spitting
image
of
its
commander
as
for
ned
land
he
ended
our
talk
in
his
best
speechifying
style
thats
all
fine
and
dandy
but
in
my
humble
opinion
a
life
in
jail
is
a
life
without
joy
for
four
days
until
february
3
the
nautilus
inspected
the
gulf
of
oman
at
various
speeds
and
depths
it
seemed
to
be
traveling
at
random
as
if
hesitating
over
which
course
to
follow
but
it
never
crossed
the
tropic
of
cancer
after
leaving
this
gulf
we
raised
muscat
for
an
instant
the
most
important
town
in
the
country
of
oman
i
marveled
at
its
strange
appearance
in
the
midst
of
the
black
rocks
surrounding
it
against
which
the
white
of
its
houses
and
forts
stood
out
sharply
i
spotted
the
rounded
domes
of
its
mosques
the
elegant
tips
of
its
minarets
and
its
fresh
leafy
terraces
but
it
was
only
a
fleeting
vision
and
the
nautilus
soon
sank
beneath
the
dark
waves
of
these
waterways
then
our
ship
went
along
at
a
distance
of
six
miles
from
the
arabic
coasts
of
mahra
and
hadhramaut
their
undulating
lines
of
mountains
relieved
by
a
few
ancient
ruins
on
february
5
we
finally
put
into
the
gulf
of
aden
a
genuine
funnel
stuck
into
the
neck
of
bab
el
mandeb
and
bottling
these
indian
waters
in
the
red
sea
on
february
6
the
nautilus
cruised
in
sight
of
the
city
of
aden
perched
on
a
promontory
connected
to
the
continent
by
a
narrow
isthmus
a
sort
of
inaccessible
gibraltar
whose
fortifications
the
english
rebuilt
after
capturing
it
in
1839
i
glimpsed
the
octagonal
minarets
of
this
town
which
used
to
be
one
of
the
wealthiest
busiest
commercial
centers
along
this
coast
as
the
arab
historian
idrisi
tells
it
i
was
convinced
that
when
captain
nemo
reached
this
point
he
would
back
out
again
but
i
was
mistaken
and
much
to
my
surprise
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
the
next
day
february
7
we
entered
the
strait
of
bab
el
mandeb
whose
name
means
gate
of
tears
in
the
arabic
language
twenty
miles
wide
its
only
fiftytwo
kilometers
long
and
with
the
nautilus
launched
at
full
speed
clearing
it
was
the
work
of
barely
an
hour
but
i
didnt
see
a
thing
not
even
perim
island
where
the
british
government
built
fortifications
to
strengthen
adens
position
there
were
many
english
and
french
steamers
plowing
this
narrow
passageway
liners
going
from
suez
to
bombay
calcutta
melbourne
runion
island
and
mauritius
far
too
much
traffic
for
the
nautilus
to
make
an
appearance
on
the
surface
so
it
wisely
stayed
in
midwater
finally
at
noon
we
were
plowing
the
waves
of
the
red
sea
the
red
sea
that
great
lake
so
famous
in
biblical
traditions
seldom
replenished
by
rains
fed
by
no
important
rivers
continually
drained
by
a
high
rate
of
evaporation
its
water
level
dropping
a
meter
and
a
half
every
year
if
it
were
fully
landlocked
like
a
lake
this
odd
gulf
might
dry
up
completely
on
this
score
its
inferior
to
its
neighbors
the
caspian
sea
and
the
dead
sea
whose
levels
lower
only
to
the
point
where
their
evaporation
exactly
equals
the
amounts
of
water
they
take
to
their
hearts
this
red
sea
is
2600
kilometers
long
with
an
average
width
of
240
in
the
days
of
the
ptolemies
and
the
roman
emperors
it
was
a
great
commercial
artery
for
the
world
and
when
its
isthmus
has
been
cut
through
it
will
completely
regain
that
bygone
importance
that
the
suez
railways
have
already
brought
back
in
part
i
would
not
even
attempt
to
understand
the
whim
that
induced
captain
nemo
to
take
us
into
this
gulf
but
i
wholeheartedly
approved
of
the
nautiluss
entering
it
it
adopted
a
medium
pace
sometimes
staying
on
the
surface
sometimes
diving
to
avoid
some
ship
and
so
i
could
observe
both
the
inside
and
topside
of
this
highly
unusual
sea
on
february
8
as
early
as
the
first
hours
of
daylight
mocha
appeared
before
us
a
town
now
in
ruins
whose
walls
would
collapse
at
the
mere
sound
of
a
cannon
and
which
shelters
a
few
leafy
date
trees
here
and
there
this
onceimportant
city
used
to
contain
six
public
marketplaces
plus
twentysix
mosques
and
its
walls
protected
by
fourteen
forts
fashioned
a
threekilometer
girdle
around
it
then
the
nautilus
drew
near
the
beaches
of
africa
where
the
sea
is
considerably
deeper
there
through
the
open
panels
and
in
a
midwater
of
crystal
clarity
our
ship
enabled
us
to
study
wonderful
bushes
of
shining
coral
and
huge
chunks
of
rock
wrapped
in
splendid
green
furs
of
algae
and
fucus
what
an
indescribable
sight
and
what
a
variety
of
settings
and
scenery
where
these
reefs
and
volcanic
islands
leveled
off
by
the
libyan
coast
but
soon
the
nautilus
hugged
the
eastern
shore
where
these
tree
forms
appeared
in
all
their
glory
this
was
off
the
coast
of
tihama
and
there
such
zoophyte
displays
not
only
flourished
below
sea
level
but
they
also
fashioned
picturesque
networks
that
unreeled
as
high
as
ten
fathoms
above
it
the
latter
were
more
whimsical
but
less
colorful
than
the
former
which
kept
their
bloom
thanks
to
the
moist
vitality
of
the
waters
how
many
delightful
hours
i
spent
in
this
way
at
the
lounge
window
how
many
new
specimens
of
underwater
flora
and
fauna
i
marveled
at
beneath
the
light
of
our
electric
beacon
mushroomshaped
fungus
coral
some
slatecolored
sea
anemone
including
the
species
thalassianthus
aster
among
others
organpipe
coral
arranged
like
flutes
and
just
begging
for
a
puff
from
the
god
pan
shells
unique
to
this
sea
that
dwell
in
madreporic
cavities
and
whose
bases
are
twisted
into
squat
spirals
and
finally
a
thousand
samples
of
a
polypary
i
hadnt
observed
until
then
the
common
sponge
first
division
in
the
polyp
group
the
class
spongiaria
has
been
created
by
scientists
precisely
for
this
unusual
exhibit
whose
usefulness
is
beyond
dispute
the
sponge
is
definitely
not
a
plant
as
some
naturalists
still
believe
but
an
animal
of
the
lowest
order
a
polypary
inferior
even
to
coral
its
animal
nature
isnt
in
doubt
and
we
cant
accept
even
the
views
of
the
ancients
who
regarded
it
as
halfway
between
plant
and
animal
but
i
must
say
that
naturalists
are
not
in
agreement
on
the
structural
mode
of
sponges
for
some
its
a
polypary
and
for
others
such
as
professor
milneedwards
its
a
single
solitary
individual
the
class
spongiaria
contains
about
300
species
that
are
encountered
in
a
large
number
of
seas
and
even
in
certain
streams
where
theyve
been
given
the
name
freshwater
sponges
but
their
waters
of
choice
are
the
red
sea
and
the
mediterranean
near
the
greek
islands
or
the
coast
of
syria
these
waters
witness
the
reproduction
and
growth
of
soft
delicate
bath
sponges
whose
prices
run
as
high
as
150
francs
apiece
the
yellow
sponge
from
syria
the
horn
sponge
from
barbary
etc
but
since
i
had
no
hope
of
studying
these
zoophytes
in
the
seaports
of
the
levant
from
which
we
were
separated
by
the
insuperable
isthmus
of
suez
i
had
to
be
content
with
observing
them
in
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
so
i
called
conseil
to
my
side
while
at
an
average
depth
of
eight
to
nine
meters
the
nautilus
slowly
skimmed
every
beautiful
rock
on
the
easterly
coast
there
sponges
grew
in
every
shape
globular
stalklike
leaflike
fingerlike
with
reasonable
accuracy
they
lived
up
to
their
nicknames
of
basket
sponges
chalice
sponges
distaff
sponges
elkhorn
sponges

peacocks
tails
and
neptunes
glovesdesignations
bestowed
on
them
by
fishermen
more
poetically
inclined
than
scientists
a
gelatinous
semifluid
substance
coated
the
fibrous
tissue
of
these
sponges
and
from
this
tissue
there
escaped
a
steady
trickle
of
water
that
after
carrying
sustenance
to
each
cell
was
being
expelled
by
a
contracting
movement
this
jellylike
substance
disappears
when
the
polyp
dies
emitting
ammonia
as
it
rots
finally
nothing
remains
but
the
fibers
either
gelatinous
or
made
of
horn
that
constitute
your
household
sponge
which
takes
on
a
russet
hue
and
is
used
for
various
tasks
depending
on
its
degree
of
elasticity
permeability
or
resistance
to
saturation
these
polyparies
were
sticking
to
rocks
shells
of
mollusks
and
even
the
stalks
of
water
plants
they
adorned
the

that
sponges
are
fished
up
in
two
ways
either
by
dragnet
or
by
hand
the
latter
method
calls
for
the
services
of
a
diver
but
its
preferable
because
it
spares
the
polyparys

leaving
it
with
a
much
higher

other

chiefly
of
a
very
elegant
species

represented
by

captain
nemo
climbed
onto
the
platform
where
i
happened
to
be
i
vowed
not
to
let
him
go
below
again
without
at
least
sounding
him
out
on
his
future
plans
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
came
over
graciously
offered
me
a
cigar
and
said
to
me
well
professor
are
you
pleased
with
this
red
sea
have
you
seen
enough
of
its
hidden
wonders
its
fish
and
zoophytes
its
gardens
of
sponges
and
forests
of
coral
have
you
glimpsed
the
towns
built
on
its
shores
yes
captain
nemo
i
replied
and
the
nautilus
is
wonderfully
suited
to
this
whole
survey
ah
its
a
clever
boat
yes
sir
clever
daring
and
invulnerable
it
fears
neither
the
red
seas
dreadful
storms
nor
its
currents
and
reefs
indeed
i
said
this
sea
is
mentioned
as
one
of
the
worst
and
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
if
im
not
mistaken
it
had
an
abominable
reputation
thoroughly
abominable
professor
aronnax
the
greek
and
latin
historians
can
find
nothing
to
say
in
its
favor
and
the
greek
geographer
strabo
adds
that
its
especially
rough
during
the
rainy
season
and
the
period
of
summer
prevailing
winds
the
arab
idrisi
referring
to
it
by
the
name
gulf
of
colzoum
relates
that
ships
perished
in
large
numbers
on
its
sandbanks
and
that
no
one
risked
navigating
it
by
night
this
he
claims
is
a
sea
subject
to
fearful
hurricanes
strewn
with
inhospitable
islands
and
with
nothing
good
to
offer
either
on
its
surface
or
in
its
depths
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
same
views
can
also
be
found
in
arrian
agatharchides
and
artemidorus
one
can
easily
see
i
answered
that
those
historians
didnt
navigate
aboard
the
nautilus
indeed
the
captain
replied
with
a
smile
and
in
this
respect
the
moderns
arent
much
farther
along
than
the
ancients
it
took
many
centuries
to
discover
the
mechanical
power
of
steam
who
knows
whether
well
see
a
second
nautilus
within
the
next
100
years
progress
is
slow
professor
aronnax
its
true
i
replied
your
ship
is
a
century
ahead
of
its
time
perhaps
several
centuries
it
would
be
most
unfortunate
if
such
a
secret
were
to
die
with
its
inventor
captain
nemo
did
not
reply
after
some
minutes
of
silence
we
were
discussing
he
said
the
views
of
ancient
historians
on
the
dangers
of
navigating
this
red
sea
true
i
replied
but
werent
their
fears
exaggerated
yes
and
no
professor
aronnax
answered
captain
nemo
who
seemed
to
know
his
red
sea
by
heart
to
a
modern
ship
well
rigged
solidly
constructed
and
in
control
of
its
course
thanks
to
obedient
steam
some
conditions
are
no
longer
hazardous
that
offered
all
sorts
of
dangers
to
the
vessels
of
the
ancients
picture
those
early
navigators
venturing
forth
in
sailboats
built
from
planks
lashed
together
with
palmtree
ropes
caulked
with
powdered
resin
and
coated
with
dogfish
grease
they
didnt
even
have
instruments
for
taking
their
bearings
they
went
by
guesswork
in
the
midst
of
currents
they
barely
knew
under
such
conditions
shipwrecks
had
to
be
numerous
but
nowadays
steamers
providing
service
between
suez
and
the
south
seas
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
fury
of
this
gulf
despite
the
contrary
winds
of
its
monsoons
their
captains
and
passengers
no
longer
prepare
for
departure
with
sacrifices
to
placate
the
gods
and
after
returning
they
dont
traipse
in
wreaths
and
gold
ribbons
to
say
thanks
at
the
local
temple
agreed
i
said
and
steam
seems
to
have
killed
off
all
gratitude
in
seamens
hearts
but
since
you
seem
to
have
made
a
special
study
of
this
sea
captain
can
you
tell
me
how
it
got
its
name
many
explanations
exist
on
the
subject
professor
aronnax
would
you
like
to
hear
the
views
of
one
chronicler
in
the
14th
century
gladly
this
fanciful
fellow
claims
the
sea
was
given
its
name
after
the
crossing
of
the
israelites
when
the
pharaoh
perished
in
those
waves
that
came
together
again
at
moses
command
to
mark
that
miraculous
sequel
the
sea
turned
a
red
without
equal
thus
no
other
course
would
do
but
to
name
it
for
its
hue
an
artistic
explanation
captain
nemo
i
replied
but
im
unable
to
rest
content
with
it
so
ill
ask
you
for
your
own
personal
views
here
they
come
to
my
thinking
professor
aronnax
this
red
sea
designation
must
be
regarded
as
a
translation
of
the
hebrew
word
edrom
and
if
the
ancients
gave
it
that
name
it
was
because
of
the
unique
color
of
its
waters
until
now
however
ive
seen
only
clear
waves
without
any
unique
hue
surely
but
as
we
move
ahead
to
the
far
end
of
this
gulf
youll
note
its
odd
appearance
i
recall
seeing
the
bay
of
el
tur
completely
red
like
a
lake
of
blood
and
you
attribute
this
color
to
the
presence
of
microscopic
algae
yes
its
a
purplish
mucilaginous
substance
produced
by
those
tiny
buds
known
by
the
name
trichodesmia
40000
of
which
are
needed
to
occupy
the
space
of
one
square
millimeter
perhaps
youll
encounter
them
when
we
reach
el
tur
hence
captain
nemo
this
isnt
the
first
time
youve
gone
through
the
red
sea
aboard
the
nautilus
no
sir
then
since
youve
already
mentioned
the
crossing
of
the
israelites
and
the
catastrophe
that
befell
the
egyptians
i
would
ask
if
youve
ever
discovered
any
traces
under
the
waters
of
that
great
historic
event
no
professor
and
for
an
excellent
reason
whats
that
its
because
that
same
locality
where
moses
crossed
with
all
his
people
is
now
so
clogged
with
sand
camels
can
barely
get
their
legs
wet
you
can
understand
that
my
nautilus
wouldnt
have
enough
water
for
itself
and
that
locality
is




i
asked
that
locality
lies
a
little
above
suez
in
a
sound
that
used
to
form
a
deep
estuary
when
the
red
sea
stretched
as
far
as
the
bitter
lakes
now
whether
or
not
their
crossing
was
literally
miraculous
the
israelites
did
cross
there
in
returning
to
the
promised
land
and
the
pharaohs
army
did
perish
at
precisely
that
locality
so
i
think
that
excavating
those
sands
would
bring
to
light
a
great
many
weapons
and
tools
of
egyptian
origin
obviously
i
replied
and
for
the
sake
of
archaeology
lets
hope
that
sooner
or
later
such
excavations
do
take
place
once
new
towns
are
settled
on
the
isthmus
after
the
suez
canal
has
been
cut
througha
canal
by
the
way
of
little
use
to
a
ship
such
as
the
nautilus
surely
but
of
great
use
to
the
world
at
large
captain
nemo
said
the
ancients
well
understood
the
usefulness
to
commerce
of
connecting
the
red
sea
with
the
mediterranean
but
they
never
dreamed
of
cutting
a
canal
between
the
two
and
instead
they
picked
the
nile
as
their
link
if
we
can
trust
tradition
it
was
probably
egypts
king
sesostris
who
started
digging
the
canal
needed
to
join
the
nile
with
the
red
sea
whats
certain
is
that
in
615
bc
king
necho
ii
was
hard
at
work
on
a
canal
that
was
fed
by
nile
water
and
ran
through
the
egyptian
plains
opposite
arabia
this
canal
could
be
traveled
in
four
days
and
it
was
so
wide
two
tripletiered
galleys
could
pass
through
it
abreast
its
construction
was
continued
by
darius
the
great
son
of
hystaspes
and
probably
completed
by
king
ptolemy
ii
strabo
saw
it
used
for
shipping
but
the
weakness
of
its
slope
between
its
starting
point
near
bubastis
and
the
red
sea
left
it
navigable
only
a
few
months
out
of
the
year
this
canal
served
commerce
until
the
century
of
romes
antonine
emperors
it
was
then
abandoned
and
covered
with
sand
subsequently
reinstated
by
arabias
caliph
omar
i
and
finally
filled
in
for
good
in
761
or
762
ad
by
caliph
almansur
in
an
effort
to
prevent
supplies
from
reaching
mohammed
ibn
abdullah
who
had
rebelled
against
him
during
his
egyptian
campaign
your
general
napoleon
bonaparte
discovered
traces
of
this
old
canal
in
the
suez
desert
and
when
the
tide
caught
him
by
surprise
he
wellnigh
perished
just
a
few
hours
before
rejoining
his
regiment
at
hadjaroth
the
very
place
where
moses
had
pitched
camp
3300
years
before
him
well
captain
what
the
ancients
hesitated
to
undertake
mr
de
lesseps
is
now
finishing
up
his
joining
of
these
two
seas
will
shorten
the
route
from
cadiz
to
the
east
indies
by
9000
kilometers
and
hell
soon
change
africa
into
an
immense
island
yes
professor
aronnax
and
you
have
every
right
to
be
proud
of
your
fellow
countryman
such
a
man
brings
a
nation
more
honor
than
the
greatest
commanders
like
so
many
others
he
began
with
difficulties
and
setbacks
but
he
triumphed
because
he
has
the
volunteer
spirit
and
its
sad
to
think
that
this
deed
which
should
have
been
an
international
deed
which
would
have
insured
that
any
administration
went
down
in
history
will
succeed
only
through
the
efforts
of
one
man
so
all
hail
to
mr
de
lesseps
yes
all
hail
to
that
great
french
citizen
i
replied
quite
startled
by
how
emphatically
captain
nemo
had
just
spoken
unfortunately
he
went
on
i
cant
take
you
through
that
suez
canal
but
the
day
after
tomorrow
youll
be
able
to
see
the
long
jetties
of
port
said
when
were
in
the
mediterranean
in
the
mediterranean
i
exclaimed
yes
professor
does
that
amaze
you
what
amazes
me
is
thinking
well
be
there
the
day
after
tomorrow
oh
really
yes
captain
although
since
ive
been
aboard
your
vessel
i
should
have
formed
the
habit
of
not
being
amazed
by
anything
but
what
is
it
that
startles
you
the
thought
of
how
hideously
fast
the
nautilus
will
need
to
go
if
its
to
double
the
cape
of
good
hope
circle
around
africa
and
lie
in
the
open
mediterranean
by
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
who
says
it
will
circle
africa
professor
whats
this
talk
about
doubling
the
cape
of
good
hope
but
unless
the
nautilus
navigates
on
dry
land
and
crosses
over
the
isthmus
or
under
it

aronnax
under
it
surely
captain
nemo
replied
serenely
under
that
tongue
of
land
nature
long
ago
made
what
man
today
is
making
on
its
surface
what
theres
a
passageway
yes
an
underground
passageway
that
ive
named
the
arabian
tunnel
it
starts
below
suez
and
leads
to
the
bay
of
pelusium
but
isnt
that
isthmus
only
composed
of
quicksand
to
a
certain
depth
but
at
merely
fifty
meters
one
encounters
a
firm
foundation
of
rock
and
its
by
luck
that
you
discovered
this
passageway
i
asked
more
and
more
startled
luck
plus
logic
professor
and
logic
even
more
than
luck
captain
i
hear
you
but
i
cant
believe
my
ears
oh
sir
the
old
saying
still
holds
good
aures
habent
et
non
audient
not
only
does
this
passageway
exist
but
ive
taken
advantage
of
it
on
several
occasions
without
it
i
wouldnt
have
ventured
today
into
such
a
blind
alley
as
the
red
sea
latin
they
have
ears
but
hear
not
ed
is
it
indiscreet
to
ask
how
you
discovered
this
tunnel
sir
the
captain
answered
me
there
can
be
no
secrets
between
men
who
will
never
leave
each
other
i
ignored
this
innuendo
and
waited
for
captain
nemos
explanation
professor
he
told
me
the
simple
logic
of
the
naturalist
led
me
to
discover
this
passageway
and
i
alone
am
familiar
with
it
id
noted
that
in
the
red
sea
and
the
mediterranean
there
exist
a
number
of
absolutely
identical
species
of
fish
eels
butterfish
greenfish
bass
jewelfish
flying
fish
certain
of
this
fact
i
wondered
if
there
werent
a
connection
between
the
two
seas
if
there
were
its
underground
current
had
to
go
from
the
red
sea
to
the
mediterranean
simply
because
of
their
difference
in
level
so
i
caught
a
large
number
of
fish
in
the
vicinity
of
suez
i
slipped
copper
rings
around
their
tails
and
tossed
them
back
into
the
sea
a
few
months
later
off
the
coast
of
syria
i
recaptured
a
few
specimens
of
my
fish
adorned
with
their
telltale
rings
so
this
proved
to
me
that
some
connection
existed
between
the
two
seas
i
searched
for
it
with
my
nautilus
i
discovered
it
i
ventured
into
it
and
soon
professor
you
also
will
have
cleared
my
arabic
tunnel
chapter
5
arabian
tunnel
the
same
day
i
reported
to
conseil
and
ned
land
that
part
of
the
foregoing
conversation
directly
concerning
them
when
i
told
them
we
would
be
lying
in
mediterranean
waters
within
two
days
conseil
clapped
his
hands
but
the
canadian
shrugged
his
shoulders
an
underwater
tunnel
he
exclaimed
a
connection
between
two
seas
who
ever
heard
of
such
malarkey
ned
my
friend
conseil
replied
had
you
ever
heard
of
the
nautilus
no
yet
here
it
is
so
dont
shrug
your
shoulders
so
blithely
and
dont
discount
something
with
the
feeble
excuse
that
youve
never
heard
of
it
well
soon
see
ned
land
shot
back
shaking
his
head
after
all
id
like
nothing
better
than
to
believe
in
your
captains
little
passageway
and
may
heaven
grant
it
really
does
take
us
to
the
mediterranean
the
same
evening
at
latitude
21
degrees
30
north
the
nautilus
was
afloat
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
drawing
nearer
to
the
arab
coast
i
spotted
jidda
an
important
financial
center
for
egypt
syria
turkey
and
the
east
indies
i
could
distinguish
with
reasonable
clarity
the
overall
effect
of
its
buildings
the
ships
made
fast
along
its
wharves
and
those
bigger
vessels
whose
draft
of
water
required
them
to
drop
anchor
at
the
ports
offshore
mooring
the
sun
fairly
low
on
the
horizon
struck
full
force
on
the
houses
in
this
town
accenting
their
whiteness
outside
the
city
limits
some
wood
or
reed
huts
indicated
the
quarter
where
the
bedouins
lived
soon
jidda
faded
into
the
shadows
of
evening
and
the
nautilus
went
back
beneath
the
mildly
phosphorescent
waters
the
next
day
february
10
several
ships
appeared
running
on
our
opposite
tack
the
nautilus
resumed
its
underwater
navigating
but
at
the
moment
of
our
noon
sights
the
sea
was
deserted
and
the
ship
rose
again
to
its
waterline
with
ned
and
conseil
i
went
to
sit
on
the
platform
the
coast
to
the
east
looked
like
a
slightly
blurred
mass
in
a
damp
fog
leaning
against
the
sides
of
the
skiff
we
were
chatting
of
one
thing
and
another
when
ned
land
stretched
his
hand
toward
a
point
in
the
water
saying
to
me
see
anything
out
there
professor
no
ned
i
replied
but
you
know
i
dont
have
your
eyes
take
a
good
look
ned
went
on
there
ahead
to
starboard
almost
level
with
the
beacon
dont
you
see
a
mass
that
seems
to
be
moving
around
right
i
said
after
observing
carefully
i
can
make
out
something
like
a
long
blackish
object
on
the
surface
of
the
water
a
second
nautilus
conseil
said
no
the
canadian
replied
unless
im
badly
mistaken
thats
some
marine
animal
are
there
whales
in
the
red
sea
conseil
asked
yes
my
boy
i
replied
theyre
sometimes
found
here
thats
no
whale
continued
ned
land
whose
eyes
never
strayed
from
the
object
they
had
sighted
were
old
chums
whales
and
i
and
i
couldnt
mistake
their
little
ways
lets
wait
and
see
conseil
said
the
nautilus
is
heading
that
direction
and
well
soon
know
what
were
in
for
in
fact
that
blackish
object
was
soon
only
a
mile
away
from
us
it
looked
like
a
huge
reef
stranded
in
midocean
what
was
it
i
still
couldnt
make
up
my
mind
oh
its
moving
off
its
diving
ned
land
exclaimed
damnation
what
can
that
animal
be
it
doesnt
have
a
forked
tail
like
baleen
whales
or
sperm
whales
and
its
fins
look
like
sawedoff
limbs
but
in
that
case
i
put
in
good
lord
the
canadian
went
on
its
rolled
over
on
its
back
and
its
raising
its
breasts
in
the
air
its
a
siren
conseil
exclaimed
with
all
due
respect
to
master
its
an
actual
mermaid
that
word
siren
put
me
back
on
track
and
i
realized
that
the
animal
belonged
to
the
order
sirenia
marine
creatures
that
legends
have
turned
into
mermaids
half
woman
half
fish
no
i
told
conseil
thats
no
mermaid
its
an
unusual
creature
of
which
only
a
few
specimens
are
left
in
the
red
sea
thats
a
dugong
order
sirenia
group
pisciforma
subclass
monodelphia
class
mammalia
branch
vertebrata
conseil
replied
and
when
conseil
has
spoken
theres
nothing
else
to
be
said
meanwhile
ned
land
kept
staring
his
eyes
were
gleaming
with
desire
at
the
sight
of
that
animal
his
hands
were
ready
to
hurl
a
harpoon
you
would
have
thought
he
was
waiting
for
the
right
moment
to
jump
overboard
and
attack
the
creature
in
its
own
element
oh
sir
he
told
me
in
a
voice
trembling
with
excitement
ive
never
killed
anything
like
that
his
whole
being
was
concentrated
in
this
last
word
just
then
captain
nemo
appeared
on
the
platform
he
spotted
the
dugong
he
understood
the
canadians
frame
of
mind
and
addressed
him
directly
if
you
held
a
harpoon
mr
land
wouldnt
your
hands
be
itching
to
put
it
to
work
positively
sir
and
just
for
one
day
would
it
displease
you
to
return
to
your
fishermans
trade
and
add
this
cetacean
to
the
list
of
those
youve
already
hunted
down
it
wouldnt
displease
me
one
bit
all
right
you
can
try
your
luck
thank
you
sir
ned
land
replied
his
eyes
ablaze
only
the
captain
went
on
i
urge
you
to
aim
carefully
at
this
animal
in
your
own
personal
interest
is
the
dugong
dangerous
to
attack
i
asked
despite
the
canadians
shrug
of
the
shoulders
yes
sometimes
the
captain
replied
these
animals
have
been
known
to
turn
on
their
assailants
and
capsize
their
longboats
but
with
mr
land
that
danger
isnt
to
be
feared
his
eye
is
sharp
his
arm
is
sure
if
i
recommend
that
he
aim
carefully
at
this
dugong
its
because
the
animal
is
justly
regarded
as
fine
game
and
i
know
mr
land
doesnt
despise
a
choice
morsel
aha
the
canadian
put
in
this
beast
offers
the
added
luxury
of
being
good
to
eat
yes
mr
land
its
flesh
is
actual
red
meat
highly
prized
and
set
aside
throughout
malaysia
for
the
tables
of
aristocrats
accordingly
this
excellent
animal
has
been
hunted
so
bloodthirstily
that
like
its
manatee
relatives
it
has
become
more
and
more
scarce
in
that
case
captain
conseil
said
in
all
seriousness
on
the
offchance
that
this
creature
might
be
the
last
of
its
line
wouldnt
it
be
advisable
to
spare
its
life
in
the
interests
of
science
maybe
the
canadian
answered
it
would
be
better
to
hunt
it
down
in
the
interests
of
mealtime
then
proceed
mr
land
captain
nemo
replied
just
then
as
mute
and
emotionless
as
ever
seven
crewmen
climbed
onto
the
platform
one
carried
a
harpoon
and
line
similar
to
those
used
in
whale
fishing
its
deck
paneling
opened
the
skiff
was
wrenched
from
its
socket
and
launched
to
sea
six
rowers
sat
on
the
thwarts
and
the
coxswain
took
the
tiller
ned
conseil
and
i
found
seats
in
the
stern
arent
you
coming
captain
i
asked
no
sir
but
i
wish
you
happy
hunting
the
skiff
pulled
clear
and
carried
off
by
its
six
oars
it
headed
swiftly
toward
the
dugong
which
by
then
was
floating
two
miles
from
the
nautilus
arriving
within
a
few
cable
lengths
of
the
cetacean
our
longboat
slowed
down
and
the
sculls
dipped
noiselessly
into
the
tranquil
waters
harpoon
in
hand
ned
land
went
to
take
his
stand
in
the
skiffs
bow
harpoons
used
for
hunting
whales
are
usually
attached
to
a
very
long
rope
that
pays
out
quickly
when
the
wounded
animal
drags
it
with
him
but
this
rope
measured
no
more
than
about
ten
fathoms
and
its
end
had
simply
been
fastened
to
a
small
barrel
that
while
floating
would
indicate
the
dugongs
movements
beneath
the
waters
i
stood
up
and
could
clearly
observe
the
canadians
adversary
this
dugongwhich
also
boasts
the
name
halicoreclosely
resembled
a
manatee
its
oblong
body
ended
in
a
very
long
caudal
fin
and
its
lateral
fins
in
actual
fingers
it
differs
from
the
manatee
in
that
its
upper
jaw
is
armed
with
two
long
pointed
teeth
that
form
diverging
tusks
on
either
side
this
dugong
that
ned
land
was
preparing
to
attack
was
of
colossal
dimensions
easily
exceeding
seven
meters
in
length
it
didnt
stir
and
seemed
to
be
sleeping
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
a
circumstance
that
should
have
made
it
easier
to
capture
the
skiff
approached
cautiously
to
within
three
fathoms
of
the
animal
the
oars
hung
suspended
above
their
rowlocks
i
was
crouching
his
body
leaning
slightly
back
ned
land
brandished
his
harpoon
with
expert
hands
suddenly
a
hissing
sound
was
audible
and
the
dugong
disappeared
although
the
harpoon
had
been
forcefully
hurled
it
apparently
had
hit
only
water
damnation
exclaimed
the
furious
canadian
i
missed
it
no
i
said
the
animals
wounded
theres
its
blood
but
your
weapon
didnt
stick
in
its
body
my
harpoon
get
my
harpoon
ned
land
exclaimed
the
sailors
went
back
to
their
sculling
and
the
coxswain
steered
the
longboat
toward
the
floating
barrel
we
fished
up
the
harpoon
and
the
skiff
started
off
in
pursuit
of
the
animal
the
latter
returned
from
time
to
time
to
breathe
at
the
surface
of
the
sea
its
wound
hadnt
weakened
it
because
it
went
with
tremendous
speed
driven
by
energetic
arms
the
longboat
flew
on
its
trail
several
times
we
got
within
a
few
fathoms
of
it
and
the
canadian
hovered
in
readiness
to
strike
but
then
the
dugong
would
steal
away
with
a
sudden
dive
and
it
proved
impossible
to
overtake
the
beast
ill
let
you
assess
the
degree
of
anger
consuming
our
impatient
ned
land
he
hurled
at
the
hapless
animal
the
most
potent
swearwords
in
the
english
language
for
my
part
i
was
simply
distressed
to
see
this
dugong
outwit
our
every
scheme
we
chased
it
unflaggingly
for
a
full
hour
and
id
begun
to
think
it
would
prove
too
difficult
to
capture
when
the
animal
got
the
untimely
idea
of
taking
revenge
on
us
a
notion
it
would
soon
have
cause
to
regret
it
wheeled
on
the
skiff
to
assault
us
in
its
turn
this
maneuver
did
not
escape
the
canadian
watch
out
he
said
the
coxswain
pronounced
a
few
words
in
his
bizarre
language
and
no
doubt
he
alerted
his
men
to
keep
on
their
guard
arriving
within
twenty
feet
of
the
skiff
the
dugong
stopped
sharply
sniffing
the
air
with
its
huge
nostrils
pierced
not
at
the
tip
of
its
muzzle
but
on
its
topside
then
it
gathered
itself
and
sprang
at
us
the
skiff
couldnt
avoid
the
collision
half
overturned
it
shipped
a
ton
or
two
of
water
that
we
had
to
bail
out
but
thanks
to
our
skillful
coxswain
we
were
fouled
on
the
bias
rather
than
broadside
so
we
didnt
capsize
clinging
to
the
stempost
ned
land
thrust
his
harpoon
again
and
again
into
the
gigantic
animal
which
imbedded
its
teeth
in
our
gunwale
and
lifted
the
longboat
out
of
the
water
as
a
lion
would
lift
a
deer
we
were
thrown
on
top
of
each
other
and
i
have
no
idea
how
the
venture
would
have
ended
had
not
the
canadian
still
thirsting
for
the
beasts
blood
finally
pierced
it
to
the
heart
i
heard
its
teeth
grind
on
sheet
iron
and
the
dugong
disappeared
taking
our
harpoon
along
with
it
but
the
barrel
soon
popped
up
on
the
surface
and
a
few
moments
later
the
animals
body
appeared
and
rolled
over
on
its
back
our
skiff
rejoined
it
took
it
in
tow
and
headed
to
the
nautilus
it
took
pulleys
of
great
strength
to
hoist
this
dugong
onto
the
platform
the
beast
weighed
5000
kilograms
it
was
carved
up
in
sight
of
the
canadian
who
remained
to
watch
every
detail
of
the
operation
at
dinner
the
same
day
my
steward
served
me
some
slices
of
this
flesh
skillfully
dressed
by
the
ships
cook
i
found
it
excellent
even
better
than
veal
if
not
beef
the
next
morning
february
11
the
nautiluss
pantry
was
enriched
by
more
dainty
game
a
covey
of
terns
alighted
on
the
nautilus
they
were
a

of

also

whose
neck
and

of
the

are
white
speckled
with
black
by
then
the
nautilus
had
reduced
speed
it
moved
ahead
at
a
saunter
so
to
speak
i
observed
that
the
red
seas
water
was
becoming
less
salty
the
closer
we
got
to
suez
near
five
oclock
in
the
afternoon
we
sighted
cape
ras
mohammed
to
the
north
this
cape
forms
the
tip
of
arabia
petraea
which
lies
between
the
gulf
of
suez
and
the
gulf
of
aqaba
the
nautilus
entered
the
strait
of
jubal
which
leads
to
the
gulf
of
suez
i
could
clearly
make
out
a
high
mountain
crowning
ras
mohammed
between
the
two
gulfs
it
was
mt
horeb
that
biblical
mt
sinai
on
whose
summit
moses
met
god
face
to
face
that
summit
the
minds
eye
always
pictures
as
wreathed
in
lightning
at
six
oclock
sometimes
afloat
and
sometimes
submerged
the
nautilus
passed
well
out
from
el
tur
which
sat
at
the
far
end
of
a
bay
whose
waters
seemed
to
be
dyed
red
as
captain
nemo
had
already
mentioned
then
night
fell
in
the
midst
of
a
heavy
silence
occasionally
broken
by
the
calls
of
pelicans
and
nocturnal
birds
by
the
sound
of
surf
chafing
against
rocks
or
by
the
distant
moan
of
a
steamer
churning
the
waves
of
the
gulf
with
noisy
blades
from
eight
to
nine
oclock
the
nautilus
stayed
a
few
meters
beneath
the
waters
according
to
my
calculations
we
had
to
be
quite
close
to
suez
through
the
panels
in
the
lounge
i
spotted
rocky
bottoms
brightly
lit
by
our
electric
rays
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
strait
was
getting
narrower
and
narrower
at
915
when
our
boat
returned
to
the
surface
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
i
was
quite
impatient
to
clear
captain
nemos
tunnel
couldnt
sit
still
and
wanted
to
breathe
the
fresh
night
air
soon
in
the
shadows
i
spotted
a
pale
signal
light
glimmering
a
mile
away
half
discolored
by
mist
a
floating
lighthouse
said
someone
next
to
me
i
turned
and
discovered
the
captain
thats
the
floating
signal
light
of
suez
he
went
on
it
wont
be
long
before
we
reach
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
it
cant
be
very
easy
to
enter
it
no
sir
accordingly
im
in
the
habit
of
staying
in
the
pilothouse
and
directing
maneuvers
myself
and
now
if
youll
kindly
go
below
professor
aronnax
the
nautilus
is
about
to
sink
beneath
the
waves
and
it
will
only
return
to
the
surface
after
weve
cleared
the
arabian
tunnel
i
followed
captain
nemo
the
hatch
closed
the
ballast
tanks
filled
with
water
and
the
submersible
sank
some
ten
meters
down
just
as
i
was
about
to
repair
to
my
stateroom
the
captain
stopped
me
professor
he
said
to
me
would
you
like
to
go
with
me
to
the
wheelhouse
i
was
afraid
to
ask
i
replied
come
along
then
this
way
youll
learn
the
full
story
about
this
combination
underwater
and
underground
navigating
captain
nemo
led
me
to
the
central
companionway
in
midstair
he
opened
a
door
went
along
the
upper
gangways
and
arrived
at
the
wheelhouse
which
as
you
know
stands
at
one
end
of
the
platform
it
was
a
cabin
measuring
six
feet
square
and
closely
resembling
those
occupied
by
the
helmsmen
of
steamboats
on
the
mississippi
or
hudson
rivers
in
the
center
stood
an
upright
wheel
geared
to
rudder
cables
running
to
the
nautiluss
stern
set
in
the
cabins
walls
were
four
deadlights
windows
of
biconvex
glass
that
enabled
the
man
at
the
helm
to
see
in
every
direction
the
cabin
was
dark
but
my
eyes
soon
grew
accustomed
to
its
darkness
and
i
saw
the
pilot
a
muscular
man
whose
hands
rested
on
the
pegs
of
the
wheel
outside
the
sea
was
brightly
lit
by
the
beacon
shining
behind
the
cabin
at
the
other
end
of
the
platform
now
captain
nemo
said
lets
look
for
our
passageway
electric
wires
linked
the
pilothouse
with
the
engine
room
and
from
this
cabin
the
captain
could
simultaneously
signal
heading
and
speed
to
his
nautilus
he
pressed
a
metal
button
and
at
once
the
propeller
slowed
down
significantly
i
stared
in
silence
at
the
high
sheer
wall
we
were
skirting
just
then
the
firm
base
of
the
sandy
mountains
on
the
coast
for
an
hour
we
went
along
it
in
this
fashion
staying
only
a
few
meters
away
captain
nemo
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
two
concentric
circles
of
the
compass
hanging
in
the
cabin
at
a
mere
gesture
from
him
the
helmsman
would
instantly
change
the
nautiluss
heading
standing
by
the
port
deadlight
i
spotted
magnificent
coral
substructures
zoophytes
algae
and
crustaceans
with
enormous
quivering
claws
that
stretched
forth
from
crevices
in
the
rock
at
1015
captain
nemo
himself
took
the
helm
dark
and
deep
a
wide
gallery
opened
ahead
of
us
the
nautilus
was
brazenly
swallowed
up
strange
rumblings
were
audible
along
our
sides
it
was
the
water
of
the
red
sea
hurled
toward
the
mediterranean
by
the
tunnels
slope
our
engines
tried
to
offer
resistance
by
churning
the
waves
with
propeller
in
reverse
but
the
nautilus
went
with
the
torrent
as
swift
as
an
arrow
along
the
narrow
walls
of
this
passageway
i
saw
only
brilliant
streaks
hard
lines
fiery
furrows
all
scrawled
by
our
speeding
electric
light
with
my
hand
i
tried
to
curb
the
pounding
of
my
heart
at
1035
captain
nemo
left
the
steering
wheel
and
turned
to
me
the
mediterranean
he
told
me
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
swept
along
by
the
torrent
the
nautilus
had
just
cleared
the
isthmus
of
suez
chapter
6
the
greek
islands
at
sunrise
the
next
morning
february
12
the
nautilus
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
i
rushed
onto
the
platform
the
hazy
silhouette
of
pelusium
was
outlined
three
miles
to
the
south
a
torrent
had
carried
us
from
one
sea
to
the
other
but
although
that
tunnel
was
easy
to
descend
going
back
up
must
have
been
impossible
near
seven
oclock
ned
and
conseil
joined
me
those
two
inseparable
companions
had
slept
serenely
utterly
unaware
of
the
nautiluss
feat
well
mr
naturalist
the
canadian
asked
in
a
gently
mocking
tone
and
how
about
that
mediterranean
were
floating
on
its
surface
ned
my
friend
what
conseil
put
in
last
night




yes
last
night
in
a
matter
of
minutes
we
cleared
that
insuperable
isthmus
i
dont
believe
a
word
of
it
the
canadian
replied
and
youre
in
the
wrong
mr
land
i
went
on
that
flat
coastline
curving
southward
is
the
coast
of
egypt
tell
it
to
the
marines
sir
answered
the
stubborn
canadian
but
if
master
says
so
conseil
told
him
then
so
be
it
whats
more
ned
i
said
captain
nemo
himself
did
the
honors
in
his
tunnel
and
i
stood
beside
him
in
the
pilothouse
while
he
steered
the
nautilus
through
that
narrow
passageway
you
hear
ned
conseil
said
and
you
ned
who
have
such
good
eyes
i
added
you
can
spot
the
jetties
of
port
said
stretching
out
to
sea
the
canadian
looked
carefully
correct
he
said
youre
right
professor
and
your
captains
a
superman
were
in
the
mediterranean
fine
so
now
lets
have
a
chat
about
our
little
doings
if
you
please
but
in
such
a
way
that
nobody
overhears
i
could
easily
see
what
the
canadian
was
driving
at
in
any
event
i
thought
it
best
to
let
him
have
his
chat
and
we
all
three
went
to
sit
next
to
the
beacon
where
we
were
less
exposed
to
the
damp
spray
from
the
billows
now
ned
were
all
ears
i
said
what
have
you
to
tell
us
what
ive
got
to
tell
you
is
very
simple
the
canadian
replied
were
in
europe
and
before
captain
nemos
whims
take
us
deep
into
the
polar
seas
or
back
to
oceania
i
say
we
should
leave
this
nautilus
i
confess
that
such
discussions
with
the
canadian
always
baffled
me
i
didnt
want
to
restrict
my
companions
freedom
in
any
way
and
yet
i
had
no
desire
to
leave
captain
nemo
thanks
to
him
and
his
submersible
i
was
finishing
my
undersea
research
by
the
day
and
i
was
rewriting
my
book
on
the
great
ocean
depths
in
the
midst
of
its
very
element
would
i
ever
again
have
such
an
opportunity
to
observe
the
oceans
wonders
absolutely
not
so
i
couldnt
entertain
this
idea
of
leaving
the
nautilus
before
completing
our
course
of
inquiry
ned
my
friend
i
said
answer
me
honestly
are
you
bored
with
this
ship
are
you
sorry
that
fate
has
cast
you
into
captain
nemos
hands
the
canadian
paused
for
a
short
while
before
replying
then
crossing
his
arms
honestly
he
said
im
not
sorry
about
this
voyage
under
the
seas
ill
be
glad
to
have
done
it
but
in
order
to
have
done
it
it
has
to
finish
thats
my
feeling
it
will
finish
ned
where
and
when
where
i
dont
know
when
i
cant
say
or
rather
i
suppose
it
will
be
over
when
these
seas
have
nothing
more
to
teach
us
everything
that
begins
in
this
world
must
inevitably
come
to
an
end
i
think
as
master
does
conseil
replied
and
its
extremely
possible
that
after
crossing
every
sea
on
the
globe
captain
nemo
will
bid
the
three
of
us
a
fond
farewell
bid
us
a
fond
farewell
the
canadian
exclaimed
you
mean
beat
us
to
a
faretheewell
lets
not
exaggerate
mr
land
i
went
on
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
captain
but
neither
do
i
share

were
privy
to
the
nautiluss
secrets
and
i
dont
expect
that
its
commander
just
to
set
us
free
will
meekly
stand
by
while
we
spread
those
secrets
all
over
the
world
but
in
that
case
what
do
you
expect
the
canadian
asked
that
well
encounter
advantageous
conditions
for
escaping
just
as
readily
in
six
months
as
now
great
scott
ned
land
put
in
and
where
if
you
please
will
we
be
in
six
months
mr
naturalist
perhaps
here
perhaps
in
china
you
know
how
quickly
the
nautilus
moves
it
crosses
oceans
like
swallows
cross
the
air
or
express
trains
continents
it
doesnt
fear
heavily
traveled
seas
who
can
say
it
wont
hug
the
coasts
of
france
england
or
america
where
an
escape
attempt
could
be
carried
out
just
as
effectively
as
here
professor
aronnax
the
canadian
replied
your
arguments
are
rotten
to
the
core
you
talk
way
off
in
the
future
well
be
here
well
be
there
me
im
talking
about
right
now
we
are
here
and
we
must
take
advantage
of
it
i
was
hard
pressed
by
ned
lands
common
sense
and
i
felt
myself
losing
ground
i
no
longer
knew
what
arguments
to
put
forward
on
my
behalf
sir
ned
went
on
lets
suppose
that
by
some
impossibility
captain
nemo
offered
your
freedom
to
you
this
very
day
would
you
accept
i
dont
know
i
replied
and
suppose
he
adds
that
this
offer
hes
making
you
today
wont
ever
be
repeated
then
would
you
accept
i
did
not
reply
and
what
thinks
our
friend
conseil
ned
land
asked
your
friend
conseil
the
fine
lad
replied
serenely
has
nothing
to
say
for
himself
hes
a
completely
disinterested
party
on
this
question
like
his
master
like
his
comrade
ned
hes
a
bachelor
neither
wife
parents
nor
children
are
waiting
for
him
back
home
hes
in
masters
employ
he
thinks
like
master
he
speaks
like
master
and
much
to
his
regret
he
cant
be
counted
on
to
form
a
majority
only
two
persons
face
each
other
here
master
on
one
side
ned
land
on
the
other
that
said
your
friend
conseil
is
listening
and
hes
ready
to
keep
score
i
couldnt
help
smiling
as
conseil
wiped
himself
out
of
existence
deep
down
the
canadian
must
have
been
overjoyed
at
not
having
to
contend
with
him
then
sir
ned
land
said
since
conseil
is
no
more
well
have
this
discussion
between
just
the
two
of
us
ive
talked
youve
listened
whats
your
reply
it
was
obvious
that
the
matter
had
to
be
settled
and
evasions
were
distasteful
to
me
ned
my
friend
i
said
heres
my
reply
you
have
right
on
your
side
and
my
arguments
cant
stand
up
to
yours
it
will
never
do
to
count
on
captain
nemos
benevolence
the
most
ordinary
good
sense
would
forbid
him
to
set
us
free
on
the
other
hand
good
sense
decrees
that
we
take
advantage
of
our
first
opportunity
to
leave
the
nautilus
fine
professor
aronnax
thats
wisely
said
but
one
proviso
i
said
just
one
the
opportunity
must
be
the
real
thing
our
first
attempt
to
escape
must
succeed
because
if
it
misfires
we
wont
get
a
second
chance
and
captain
nemo
will
never
forgive
us
thats
also
well
put
the
canadian
replied
but
your
proviso
applies
to
any
escape
attempt
whether
it
happens
in
two
years
or
two
days
so
this
is
still
the
question
if
a
promising
opportunity
comes
up
we
have
to
grab
it
agreed
and
now
ned
will
you
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
a
promising
opportunity
one
that
leads
the
nautilus
on
a
cloudy
night
within
a
short
distance
of
some
european
coast
and
youll
try
to
get
away
by
swimming
yes
if
were
close
enough
to
shore
and
the
ships
afloat
on
the
surface
no
if
were
well
out
and
the
ships
navigating
under
the
waters
and
in
that
event
in
that
event
ill
try
to
get
hold
of
the
skiff
i
know
how
to
handle
it
well
stick
ourselves
inside
undo
the
bolts
and
rise
to
the
surface
without
the
helmsman
in
the
bow
seeing
a
thing
fine
ned
stay
on
the
lookout
for
such
an
opportunity
but
dont
forget
one
slipup
will
finish
us
i
wont
forget
sir
and
now
ned
would
you
like
to
know
my
overall
thinking
on
your
plan
gladly
professor
aronnax
well
then
i
thinkand
i
dont
mean
i
hopethat
your
promising
opportunity
wont
ever
arise
why
not
because
captain
nemo
recognizes
that
we
havent
given
up
all
hope
of
recovering
our
freedom
and
hell
keep
on
his
guard
above
all
in
seas
within
sight
of
the
coasts
of
europe
im
of
masters
opinion
conseil
said
well
soon
see
ned
land
replied
shaking
his
head
with
a
determined
expression
and
now
ned
land
i
added
lets
leave
it
at
that
not
another
word
on
any
of
this
the
day
youre
ready
alert
us
and
were
with
you
i
turn
it
all
over
to
you
thats
how
we
ended
this
conversation
which
later
was
to
have
such
serious
consequences
at
first
i
must
say
events
seemed
to
confirm
my
forecasts
much
to
the
canadians
despair
did
captain
nemo
view
us
with
distrust
in
these
heavily
traveled
seas
or
did
he
simply
want
to
hide
from
the
sight
of
those
ships
of
every
nation
that
plowed
the
mediterranean
i
have
no
idea
but
usually
he
stayed
in
midwater
and
well
out
from
any
coast
either
the
nautilus
surfaced
only
enough
to
let
its
pilothouse
emerge
or
it
slipped
away
to
the
lower
depths
although
between
the
greek
islands
and
asia
minor
we
didnt
find
bottom
even
at
2000
meters
down
accordingly
i
became
aware
of
the
isle
of
karpathos
one
of
the
sporades
islands
only
when
captain
nemo
placed
his
finger
over
a
spot
on
the
world
map
and
quoted
me
this
verse
from
virgil
est
in
carpathio
neptuni
gurgite
vates
caeruleus
proteus



latin
there
in
king
neptunes
domain
by
karpathos
his
spokesman

is
azurehued
proteus




ed
it
was
indeed
that
bygone
abode
of
proteus
the
old
shepherd
of
king
neptunes
flocks
an
island
located
between
rhodes
and
crete
which
greeks
now
call
karpathos
italians
scarpanto
through
the
lounge
window
i
could
see
only
its
granite
bedrock
the
next
day
february
14
i
decided
to
spend
a
few
hours
studying
the
fish
of
this
island
group
but
for
whatever
reason
the
panels
remained
hermetically
sealed
after
determining
the
nautiluss
heading
i
noted
that
it
was
proceeding
toward
the
ancient
island
of
crete
also
called
candia
at
the
time
i
had
shipped
aboard
the
abraham
lincoln
this
whole
island
was
in
rebellion
against
its
tyrannical
rulers
the
ottoman
empire
of
turkey
but
since
then
i
had
absolutely
no
idea
what
happened
to
this
revolution
and
captain
nemo
deprived
of
all
contact
with
the
shore
was
hardly
the
man
to
keep
me
informed
so
i
didnt
allude
to
this
event
when
that
evening
i
chanced
to
be
alone
with
the
captain
in
the
lounge
besides
he
seemed
silent
and
preoccupied
then
contrary
to
custom
he
ordered
that
both
panels
in
the
lounge
be
opened
and
going
from
the
one
to
the
other
he
carefully
observed
the
watery
mass
for
what
purpose
i
hadnt
a
guess
and
for
my
part
i
spent
my
time
studying
the
fish
that
passed
before
my
eyes
among
others
i
noted
that
sand
goby
mentioned
by
aristotle
and
commonly
known
by
the
name
sea
loach
which
is
encountered
exclusively
in
the
salty
waters
next
to
the
nile
delta
near
them
some
semiphosphorescent
red
porgy
rolled
by
a
variety
of
gilthead
that
the
egyptians
ranked
among
their
sacred
animals
lauding
them
in
religious
ceremonies
when
their
arrival
in
the
rivers
waters
announced
the
fertile
flood
season
i
also
noticed
some
wrasse
known
as
the
tapiro
three
decimeters
long
bony
fish
with
transparent
scales
whose
bluish
gray
color
is
mixed
with
red
spots
theyre
enthusiastic
eaters
of
marine
vegetables
which
gives
them
an
exquisite
flavor
hence
these
tapiro
were
much
in
demand
by
the
epicures
of
ancient
rome
and
their
entrails
were
dressed
with
brains
of
peacock
tongue
of
flamingo
and
testes
of
moray
to
make
that
divine
platter
that
so
enraptured
the
roman
emperor
vitellius
another
resident
of
these
seas
caught
my
attention
and
revived
all
my
memories
of
antiquity
this
was
the
remora
which
travels
attached
to
the
bellies
of
sharks
as
the
ancients
tell
it
when
these
little
fish
cling
to
the
undersides
of
a
ship
they
can
bring
it
to
a
halt
and
by
so
impeding
mark
antonys
vessel
during
the
battle
of
actium
one
of
them
facilitated
the
victory
of
augustus
caesar
from
such
slender
threads
hang
the
destinies
of
nations
i
also
observed
some
wonderful
snappers
belonging
to
the
order
lutianida
sacred
fish
for
the
greeks
who
claimed
they
could
drive
off
sea
monsters
from
the
waters
they
frequent
their
greek
name
anthias
means
flower
and
they
live
up
to
it
in
the
play
of
their
colors
and
in
those
fleeting
reflections
that
turn
their
dorsal
fins
into
watered
silk
their
hues
are
confined
to
a
gamut
of
reds
from
the
pallor
of
pink
to
the
glow
of
ruby
i
couldnt
take
my
eyes
off
these
marine
wonders
when
i
was
suddenly
jolted
by
an
unexpected
apparition
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
a
man
appeared
a
diver
carrying
a
little
leather
bag
at
his
belt
it
was
no
corpse
lost
in
the
waves
it
was
a
living
man
swimming
vigorously
sometimes
disappearing
to
breathe
at
the
surface
then
instantly
diving
again
i
turned
to
captain
nemo
and
in
an
agitated
voice
a
man
a
castaway
i
exclaimed
we
must
rescue
him
at
all
cost
the
captain
didnt
reply
but
went
to
lean
against
the
window
the
man
drew
near
and
gluing
his
face
to
the
panel
he
stared
at
us
to
my
deep
astonishment
captain
nemo
gave
him
a
signal
the
diver
answered
with
his
hand
immediately
swam
up
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
didnt
reappear
dont
be
alarmed
the
captain
told
me
thats
nicolas
from
cape
matapan
nicknamed
il
pesce
hes
well
known
throughout
the
cyclades
islands
a
bold
diver
water
is
his
true
element
and
he
lives
in
the
sea
more
than
on
shore
going
constantly
from
one
island
to
another
even
to
crete
italian
the
fish
ed
you
know
him
captain
why
not
professor
aronnax
this
said
captain
nemo
went
to
a
cabinet
standing
near
the
lounges
left
panel
next
to
this
cabinet
i
saw
a
chest
bound
with
hoops
of
iron
its
lid
bearing
a
copper
plaque
that
displayed
the
nautiluss
monogram
with
its
motto
mobilis
in
mobili
just
then
ignoring
my
presence
the
captain
opened
this
cabinet
a
sort
of
safe
that
contained
a
large
number
of
ingots
they
were
gold
ingots
and
they
represented
an
enormous
sum
of
money
where
had
this
precious
metal
come
from
how
had
the
captain
amassed
this
gold
and
what
was
he
about
to
do
with
it
i
didnt
pronounce
a
word
i
gaped
captain
nemo
took
out
the
ingots
one
by
one
and
arranged
them
methodically
inside
the
chest
filling
it
to
the
top
at
which
point
i
estimate
that
it
held
more
than
1000
kilograms
of
gold
in
other
words
close
to
5000000
francs
after
securely
fastening
the
chest
captain
nemo
wrote
an
address
on
its
lid
in
characters
that
must
have
been
modern
greek
this
done
the
captain
pressed
a
button
whose
wiring
was
in
communication
with
the
crews
quarters
four
men
appeared
and
not
without
difficulty
pushed
the
chest
out
of
the
lounge
then
i
heard
them
hoist
it
up
the
iron
companionway
by
means
of
pulleys
just
then
captain
nemo
turned
to
me
you
were
saying
professor
he
asked
me
i
wasnt
saying
a
thing
captain
then
sir
with
your
permission
ill
bid
you
good
evening
and
with
that
captain
nemo
left
the
lounge
i
reentered
my
stateroom
very
puzzled
as
you
can
imagine
i
tried
in
vain
to
fall
asleep
i
kept
searching
for
a
relationship
between
the
appearance
of
the
diver
and
that
chest
filled
with
gold
soon
from
certain
rolling
and
pitching
movements
i
sensed
that
the
nautilus
had
left
the
lower
strata
and
was
back
on
the
surface
of
the
water
then
i
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
platform
i
realized
that
the
skiff
was
being
detached
and
launched
to
sea
for
an
instant
it
bumped
the
nautiluss
side
then
all
sounds
ceased
two
hours
later
the
same
noises
the
same
comings
and
goings
were
repeated
hoisted
on
board
the
longboat
was
readjusted
into
its
socket
and
the
nautilus
plunged
back
beneath
the
waves
so
those
millions
had
been
delivered
to
their
address
at
what
spot
on
the
continent
who
was
the
recipient
of
captain
nemos
gold
the
next
day
i
related
the
nights
events
to
conseil
and
the
canadian
events
that
had
aroused
my
curiosity
to
a
fever
pitch
my
companions
were
as
startled
as
i
was
but
where
does
he
get
those
millions
ned
land
asked
to
this
no
reply
was
possible
after
breakfast
i
made
my
way
to
the
lounge
and
went
about
my
work
i
wrote
up
my
notes
until
five
oclock
in
the
afternoon
just
thenwas
it
due
to
some
personal
indispositioni
felt
extremely
hot
and
had
to
take
off
my
jacket
made
of
fan
mussel
fabric
a
perplexing
circumstance
because
we
werent
in
the
low
latitudes
and
besides
once
the
nautilus
was
submerged
it
shouldnt
be
subject
to
any
rise
in
temperature
i
looked
at
the
pressure
gauge
it
marked
a
depth
of
sixty
feet
a
depth
beyond
the
reach
of
atmospheric
heat
i
kept
on
working
but
the
temperature
rose
to
the
point
of
becoming
unbearable
could
there
be
a
fire
on
board
i
wondered
i
was
about
to
leave
the
lounge
when
captain
nemo
entered
he
approached
the
thermometer
consulted
it
and
turned
to
me
42
degrees
centigrade
he
said
ive
detected
as
much
captain
i
replied
and
if
it
gets
even
slightly
hotter
we
wont
be
able
to
stand
it
oh
professor
it
wont
get
any
hotter
unless
we
want
it
to
you
mean
you
can
control
this
heat
no
but
i
can
back
away
from
the
fireplace
producing
it
so
its
outside
surely
were
cruising
in
a
current
of
boiling
water
it
cant
be
i
exclaimed
look
the
panels
had
opened
and
i
could
see
a
completely
white
sea
around
the
nautilus
steaming
sulfurous
fumes
uncoiled
in
the
midst
of
waves
bubbling
like
water
in
a
boiler
i
leaned
my
hand
against
one
of
the
windows
but
the
heat
was
so
great
i
had
to
snatch
it
back
where
are
we
i
asked
near
the
island
of
santorini
professor
the
captain
answered
me
and
right
in
the
channel
that
separates
the
volcanic
islets
of
nea
kameni
and
palea
kameni
i
wanted
to
offer
you
the
unusual
sight
of
an
underwater
eruption
i
thought
i
said
that
the
formation
of
such
new
islands
had
come
to
an
end
nothing
ever
comes
to
an
end
in
these
volcanic
waterways
captain
nemo
replied
and
thanks
to
its
underground
fires
our
globe
is
continuously
under
construction
in
these
regions
according
to
the
latin
historians
cassiodorus
and
pliny
by
the
year
19
of
the
christian
era
a
new
island
the
divine
thera
had
already
appeared
in
the
very
place
these
islets
have
more
recently
formed
then
thera
sank
under
the
waves
only
to
rise
and
sink
once
more
in
the
year
69
ad
from
that
day
to
this
such
plutonic
construction
work
has
been
in
abeyance
but
on
february
3
1866
a
new
islet
named
george
island
emerged
in
the
midst
of
sulfurous
steam
near
nea
kameni
and
was
fused
to
it
on
the
6th
of
the
same
month
seven
days
later
on
february
13
the
islet
of
aphroessa
appeared
leaving
a
tenmeter
channel
between
itself
and
nea
kameni
i
was
in
these
seas
when
that
phenomenon
occurred
and
i
was
able
to
observe
its
every
phase
the
islet
of
aphroessa
was
circular
in
shape
measuring
300
feet
in
diameter
and
thirty
feet
in
height
it
was
made
of
black
glassy
lava
mixed
with
bits
of
feldspar
finally
on
march
10
a
smaller
islet
called
reka
appeared
next
to
nea
kameni
and
since
then
these
three
islets
have
fused
to
form
one
single
selfsame
island
what
about
this
channel
were
in
right
now
i
asked
here
it
is
captain
nemo
replied
showing
me
a
chart
of
the
greek
islands
you
observe
that
ive
entered
the
new
islets
in
their
place
but
will
this
channel
fill
up
one
day
very
likely
professor
aronnax
because
since
1866
eight
little
lava
islets
have
surged
up
in
front
of
the
port
of
st
nicolas
on
palea
kameni
so
its
obvious
that
nea
and
palea
will
join
in
days
to
come
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
tiny
infusoria
build
continents
but
here
theyre
built
by
volcanic
phenomena
look
sir
look
at
the
construction
work
going
on
under
these
waves
i
returned
to
the
window
the
nautilus
was
no
longer
moving
the
heat
had
become
unbearable
from
the
white
it
had
recently
been
the
sea
was
turning
red
a
coloration
caused
by
the
presence
of
iron
salts
although
the
lounge
was
hermetically
sealed
it
was
filling
with
an
intolerable
stink
of
sulfur
and
i
could
see
scarlet
flames
of
such
brightness
they
overpowered
our
electric
light
i
was
swimming
in
perspiration
i
was
stifling
i
was
about
to
be
cooked
yes
i
felt
myself
cooking
in
actual
fact
we
cant
stay
any
longer
in
this
boiling
water
i
told
the
captain
no
it
wouldnt
be
advisable
replied
nemo
the
emotionless
he
gave
an
order
the
nautilus
tacked
about
and
retreated
from
this
furnace
it
couldnt
brave
with
impunity
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
were
breathing
fresh
air
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
it
then
occurred
to
me
that
if
ned
had
chosen
these
waterways
for
our
escape
attempt
we
wouldnt
have
come
out
alive
from
this
sea
of
fire
the
next
day
february
16
we
left
this
basin
which
tallies
depths
of
3000
meters
between
rhodes
and
alexandria
and
passing
well
out
from
cerigo
island
after
doubling

this

neptune

struggle

says
the

historian
michelet
a
man
is
revived
by
one
of
the
most
invigorating
climates
in
the
world
latin
our
sea
ed
but
as
beautiful
as
it
was
i
could
get
only
a
quick
look
at
this
basin
whose
surface
area
comprises
2000000
square
kilometers
even
captain
nemos
personal
insights
were
denied
me
because
that
mystifying
individual
didnt
appear
one
single
time
during
our
highspeed
crossing
i
estimate
that
the
nautilus
covered
a
track
of
some
600
leagues
under
the
waves
of
this
sea
and
this
voyage
was
accomplished
in
just
twentyfour
hours
times
two
departing
from
the
waterways
of
greece
on
the
morning
of
february
16
we
cleared
the
strait
of
gibraltar
by
sunrise
on
the
18th
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
this
mediterranean
pinned
in
the
middle
of
those
shores
he
wanted
to
avoid
gave
captain
nemo
no
pleasure
its
waves
and
breezes
brought
back
too
many
memories
if
not
too
many
regrets
here
he
no
longer
had
the
ease
of
movement
and
freedom
of
maneuver
that
the
oceans
allowed
him
and
his
nautilus
felt
cramped
so
close
to
the
coasts
of
both
africa
and
europe
accordingly
our
speed
was
twentyfive
miles
that
is
twelve
fourkilometer
leagues
per
hour
needless
to
say
ned
land
had
to
give
up
his
escape
plans
much
to
his
distress
swept
along
at
the
rate
of
twelve
to
thirteen
meters
per
second
he
could
hardly
make
use
of
the
skiff
leaving
the
nautilus
under
these
conditions
would
have
been
like
jumping
off
a
train
racing
at
this
speed
a
rash
move
if
there
ever
was
one
moreover
to
renew
our
air
supply
the
submersible
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
only
at
night
and
relying
solely
on
compass
and
log
it
steered
by
dead
reckoning
inside
the
mediterranean
then
i
could
catch
no
more
of
its
fastpassing
scenery
than
a
traveler
might
see
from
an
express
train
in
other
words
i
could
view
only
the
distant
horizons
because
the
foregrounds
flashed
by
like
lightning
but
conseil
and
i
were
able
to
observe
those
mediterranean
fish
whose
powerful
fins
kept
pace
for
a
while
in
the
nautiluss
waters
we
stayed
on
watch
before
the
lounge
windows
and
our
notes
enable
me
to
reconstruct
in
a
few
words
the
ichthyology
of
this
sea
among
the
various
fish
inhabiting
it
some
i
viewed
others
i
glimpsed
and
the
rest
i
missed
completely
because
of
the
nautiluss
speed
kindly
allow
me
to
sort
them
out
using
this
whimsical
system
of
classification
it
will
at
least
convey
the
quickness
of
my
observations
in
the
midst
of
the
watery
mass
brightly
lit
by
our
electric
beams
there
snaked
past
those
onemeter
lampreys
that
are
common
to
nearly
every
clime
a
type
of

a
white

with
a
spotted

was
carried
along
by
the
currents
like
a
huge
wideopen
shawl
other
rays
passed
by
so
quickly
i
couldnt
tell
if
they
deserved
that
name
eagle

coined
by
the
ancient
greeks
or
those
designations
of
rat

that
modern

have
inflicted
on
them

as

in

contrasted
with
the
dark

of
their

sacred
to
the

their

prehistoric
times

its

magnificent
sturgeons
nine

extremely
fast

their
powerful
tails
against
the
glass
of
our
panels
showing
bluish
backs
with
small
brown
spots
they
resemble
sharks
without
equaling
their
strength
and
are
encountered
in
every
sea
in
the
spring
they

in
swimming
up

while
feeding
on
herring
mackerel
salmon
and
codfish
although
they
belong
to
the
class
of
cartilaginous
fish
they
rate
as
a
delicacy
theyre
eaten
fresh
dried
marinated
or
saltpreserved
and
in
olden
times
they
were
borne
in
triumph
to
the
table
of
the
roman
epicure
lucullus
but
whenever
the
nautilus
drew
near
the
surface
those
denizens
of
the
mediterranean
i
could
observe
most
productively
belonged
to
the
sixtythird
genus
of
bony
fish
these
were
tuna
from
the
genus
scomber
blueblack
on
top
silver
on
the
belly
armor
their
dorsal
stripes
giving
off
a
golden
gleam
they
are
said
to
follow
ships
in
search
of
refreshing
shade
from
the
hot
tropical
sun
and
they
did
just
that
with
the
nautilus
as
they
had
once
done
with
the
vessels
of
the
count
de
la
prouse
for
long
hours
they
competed
in
speed
with
our
submersible
i
couldnt
stop
marveling
at
these
animals
so
perfectly
cut
out
for
racing
their
heads
small
their
bodies
sleek
spindleshaped
and
in
some
cases
over
three

they
equal
these

formation
which
prompted
the
ancients
to
say
theyd
boned
up
on

military
strategy
and
yet
they
cant
escape
the
provenal
fishermen
who
prize
them
as
highly
as
did
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
turkey

these
valuable

leap

just
for
the

ill
mention
those
mediterranean

that
conseil
and
i
barely
glimpsed
there
were
whitish
eels
of
the
species
gymnotus
fasciatus
that
passed
like
elusive
wisps
of
steam
conger
eels
three
to
four
meters
long
that
were
tricked
out
in
green
blue
and
yellow
threefoot

with
a
liver
that
makes

some

that
actually
respond
to
tinkling

were
like

with
yellowish

mostly
marbled
in

finally
schools
of
wonderful
red

real
oceanic
birds
of
paradise
that
ancient
romans
bought
for
as
much
as
10000
sesterces
apiece
and
which
they
killed
at
the
table
so
they
could
heartlessly
watch
it
change
color
from
cinnabar
red
when
alive
to
pallid
white
when
dead
and
as
for
other
fish
common
to
the
atlantic

i
was
unable

representatives
of
the
order
pleuronecta
such
as
sole
flounder
plaice

simply
because
of
the
dizzying
speed
with
which
the
nautilus
hustled
through
these
opulent
waters
as
for
marine
mammals
on
passing
by
the
mouth
of
the
adriatic
sea
i
thought
i
recognized
two
or
three
sperm
whales
equipped
with
the
single
dorsal
fin
denoting
the
genus
physeter
some

from
the
genus
globicephalus
exclusive
to
the

the
forepart
of
the

striped
with
small
distinct
lines
and
also
a
dozen
seals
with
white
bellies
and
black
coats
known
by
the
name
monk
seals
and
just
as
solemn
as
if
they
were
threemeter
dominicans
for
his
part
conseil
thought
he
spotted
a
turtle
six
feet
wide
and
adorned
with
three
protruding
ridges
that
ran
lengthwise
i
was
sorry
to
miss
this
reptile
because
from
conseils
description
i
believe
i
recognized
the
leatherback
turtle
a
pretty
rare
species
for
my
part
i
noted
only
some
loggerhead
turtles
with
long
carapaces
as
for
zoophytes
for
a
few
moments
i
was
able
to
marvel
at
a
wonderful
orangehued
hydra
from
the
genus
galeolaria
that
clung
to
the
glass
of
our
port
panel
it
consisted
of
a
long
lean
filament
that
spread
out
into
countless
branches
and
ended
in
the
most
delicate
lace
ever
spun
by
the
followers
of
arachne
unfortunately
i
couldnt
fish
up
this
wonderful
specimen
and
surely
no
other
mediterranean
zoophytes
would
have
been
offered
to
my
gaze
if
on
the
evening
of
the
16th
the
nautilus
hadnt
slowed
down
in
an
odd
fashion
this
was
the
situation
by
then
we
were
passing
between
sicily
and
the
coast
of
tunisia
in
the
cramped
space
between
cape
bon
and
the
strait
of
messina
the
sea
bottom
rises
almost
all
at
once
it
forms
an
actual
ridge
with
only
seventeen
meters
of
water
remaining
above
it
while
the
depth
on
either
side
is
170
meters
consequently
the
nautilus
had
to
maneuver
with
caution
so
as
not
to
bump
into
this
underwater
barrier
i
showed
conseil
the
position
of
this
long
reef
on
our
chart
of
the
mediterranean
but
with
all
due
respect
to
master
conseil
ventured
to
observe
its
like
an
actual
isthmus
connecting
europe
to
africa
yes
my
boy
i
replied
it
cuts
across
the
whole
strait
of
sicily
and
smiths
soundings
prove
that
in
the
past
these
two
continents
were
genuinely
connected
between
cape
boeo
and
cape
farina
i
can
easily
believe
it
conseil
said
i
might
add
i
went
on
that
theres
a
similar
barrier
between
gibraltar
and
ceuta
and
in
prehistoric
times
it
closed
off
the
mediterranean
completely
gracious
conseil
put
in
suppose
one
day
some
volcanic
upheaval
raises
these
two
barriers
back
above
the
waves
thats
most
unlikely
conseil
if
master
will
allow
me
to
finish
i
mean
that
if
this
phenomenon
occurs
it
might
prove
distressing
to
mr
de
lesseps
who
has
gone
to
such
pains
to
cut
through
his
isthmus
agreed
but
i
repeat
conseil
such
a
phenomenon
wont
occur
the
intensity
of
these
underground
forces
continues
to
diminish
volcanoes
were
quite
numerous
in
the
worlds
early
days
but
theyre
going
extinct
one
by
one
the
heat
inside
the
earth
is
growing
weaker
the
temperature
in
the
globes
lower
strata
is
cooling
appreciably
every
century
and
to
our
globes
detriment
because
its
heat
is
its
life
but
the
sun
the
sun
isnt
enough
conseil
can
it
restore
heat
to
a
corpse
not
that
ive
heard
well
my
friend
someday
the
earth
will
be
just
such
a
cold
corpse
like
the
moon
which
long
ago
lost
its
vital
heat
our
globe
will
become
lifeless
and
unlivable
in
how
many
centuries

asked

ample

replied
if
ned

doesnt
mess

up
thus
reassured
conseil
went
back
to
studying
the
shallows
that
the
nautilus
was
skimming
at
moderate

as

has
very
appropriately
divided
them
into
six
classes
three
of
which
belong
to
the
marine
world
these
classes
are
the
crustacea
cirripedia
and
annelida
crustaceans
are
subdivided
into
nine
orders
and
the
first
of
these
consists
of
the
decapods
in
other
words
animals
whose
head
and
thorax
are
usually
fused
whose
cheekandmouth
mechanism
is
made
up
of
several
pairs
of
appendages
and
whose
thorax
has
four
five
or
six
pairs
of
walking
legs
conseil
used
the
methods
of
our
mentor
professor
milneedwards
who
puts
the
decapods
in
three
divisions
brachyura
macrura
and
anomura
these
names
may
look
a
tad
fierce
but
theyre
accurate
and
appropriate
among
the
brachyura
conseil
mentions
some
amanthia
crabs
whose
fronts
were
armed
with
two
big
diverging
tips
those
inachus
scorpions

to
the
ancient

of
the
massena
and
spinimane
varieties
that
had
probably
gone
astray
in

they
usually
live

etc
among
the
macrura
which
are
subdivided
into
five
families
hardshells
burrowers
crayfish
prawns
and
ghost
crabs
conseil
mentions
some
common
spiny
lobsters
whose
females
supply
a
meat
highly
prized
slipper
lobsters
or
common
shrimp
waterside
gebia
shrimp
and
all
sorts
of
edible
species
but
he
says
nothing
of
the
crayfish
subdivision
that
includes
the
true
lobster
because
spiny
lobsters
are
the
only
type
in
the
mediterranean
finally
among
the
anomura
he
saw
common
drocina
crabs
dwelling
inside
whatever
abandoned
seashells
they
could
take
over
homola
crabs
with
spiny
fronts
hermit
crabs
hairy
porcelain
crabs
etc
there
conseils
work
came
to
a
halt
he
didnt
have
time
to
finish
off
the
class
crustacea
through
an
examination
of
its
stomatopods
amphipods
homopods
isopods
trilobites
branchiopods
ostracods
and
entomostraceans
and
in
order
to
complete
his
study
of
marine
articulates
he
needed
to
mention
the
class
cirripedia
which
contains
water
fleas
and
carp
lice
plus
the
class
annelida
which
he
would
have
divided
without
fail
into
tubifex
worms
and
dorsibranchian
worms
but
having
gone
past
the
shallows
of
the
strait
of
sicily
the
nautilus
resumed
its
usual
deepwater
speed

then
on
no
more

no
more

no
more

a
few
large

sweeping
by
like
shadows
during
the
night
of
february
1617
we
entered
the
second
mediterranean
basin
whose
maximum
depth
we
found
at
3000
meters
the
nautilus
driven
downward
by
its
propeller
and
slanting
fins
descended
to
the
lowest
strata
of
this
sea
there
in
place
of
natural
wonders
the
watery
mass
offered
some
thrilling
and
dreadful
scenes
to
my
eyes
in
essence
we
were
then
crossing
that
part
of
the
whole
mediterranean
so
fertile
in
casualties
from
the
coast
of
algiers
to
the

how
many

vanished
compared

the
vast
liquid

the

some
of
these
wrecked
ships
had
perished
in
collisions
others
from
hitting
granite
reefs
i
saw
a
few
that
had
sunk
straight
down
their
masting
still
upright
their
rigging
stiffened
by
the
water
they
looked
like
they
were
at
anchor
by
some
immense
open
offshore
mooring
where
they
were
waiting
for
their
departure
time
when
the
nautilus
passed
between
them
covering
them
with
sheets
of
electricity
they
seemed
ready
to
salute
us
with
their
colors
and
send
us
their
serial
numbers
but
no
nothing
but
silence
and
death
filled
this
field
of
catastrophes
i
observed
that
these
mediterranean
depths
became
more
and
more
cluttered
with
such
gruesome
wreckage
as
the
nautilus
drew
nearer
to
the
strait
of
gibraltar
by
then
the
shores
of
africa
and
europe
were
converging
and
in
this
narrow
space
collisions
were
commonplace
there
i
saw
numerous
iron
undersides
the
phantasmagoric
ruins
of
steamers
some
lying
down
others
rearing
up
like
fearsome
animals
one
of
these
boats
made
a
dreadful
first
impression
sides
torn
open
funnel
bent
paddle
wheels
stripped
to
the
mountings
rudder
separated
from
the
sternpost
and
still
hanging
from
an
iron
chain
the
board
on
its
stern
eaten
away
by
marine
salts
how
many
lives
were
dashed
in
this
shipwreck
how
many
victims
were
swept
under
the
waves
had
some
sailor
on
board
lived
to
tell
the
story
of
this
dreadful
disaster
or
do
the
waves
still
keep
this
casualty
a
secret
it
occurred
to
me
lord
knows
why
that
this
boat
buried
under
the
sea
might
have
been
the
atlas
lost
with
all
hands
some
twenty
years
ago
and
never
heard
from
again
oh
what
a
gruesome
tale
these
mediterranean
depths
could
tell
this
huge
boneyard
where
so
much
wealth
has
been
lost
where
so
many
victims
have
met
their
deaths
meanwhile
briskly
unconcerned
the
nautilus
ran
at
full
propeller
through
the
midst
of
these
ruins
on
february
18
near
three
oclock
in
the
morning
it
hove
before
the
entrance
to
the
strait
of
gibraltar
there
are
two
currents
here
an
upper
current
long
known
to
exist
that
carries
the
oceans
waters
into
the
mediterranean
basin
then
a
lower
countercurrent
the
only
presentday
proof
of
its
existence
being
logic
in
essence
the
mediterranean
receives
a
continual
influx
of
water
not
only
from
the
atlantic
but
from
rivers
emptying
into
it
since
local
evaporation
isnt
enough
to
restore
the
balance
the
total
amount
of
added
water
should
make
this
seas
level
higher
every
year
yet
this
isnt
the
case
and
were
naturally
forced
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
some
lower
current
that
carries
the
mediterraneans
surplus
through
the
strait
of
gibraltar
and
into
the
atlantic
basin
and
so
it
turned
out
the
nautilus
took
full
advantage
of
this
countercurrent
it
advanced
swiftly
through
this
narrow
passageway
for
an
instant
i
could
glimpse
the
wonderful
ruins
of
the
temple
of
hercules
buried
undersea
as
pliny
and
avianus
have
mentioned
together
with
the
flat
island
they
stand
on
and
a
few
minutes
later
we
were
floating

the

broke
these

with

spur
after
doing

10000

in

what

in

for

from

the
nautilus
took
to
the
high
seas
it
returned
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
so
our
daily
strolls
on
the
platform
were
restored
to

twelve
miles
away
cape
st
vincent
was
hazily
visible
the
southwestern
tip
of
the
hispanic
peninsula
the
wind
was
blowing
a
pretty
strong
gust
from
the
south
the
sea
was
swelling
and
surging
its
waves
made
the
nautilus
roll
and
jerk
violently
it
was
nearly
impossible
to
stand
up
on
the
platform
which
was
continuously
buffeted
by
this
enormously
heavy
sea
after
inhaling
a
few
breaths
of
air
we
went
below
once
more
i
repaired
to
my
stateroom
conseil
returned
to
his
cabin
but
the
canadian
looking
rather
worried
followed
me
our
quick
trip
through
the
mediterranean
hadnt
allowed
him
to
put
his
plans
into
execution
and
he
could
barely
conceal
his
disappointment
after
the
door
to
my
stateroom
was
closed
he
sat
and
stared
at
me
silently
ned
my
friend
i
told
him
i
know
how
you
feel
but
you
mustnt
blame
yourself
given
the
way
the
nautilus
was
navigating
it
would
have
been
sheer
insanity
to
think
of
escaping
ned
land
didnt
reply
his
pursed
lips
and
frowning
brow
indicated
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
his
monomania
look
here
i
went
on
as
yet
theres
no
cause
for
despair
were
going
up
the
coast
of
portugal
france
and
england
arent
far
off
and
there
well
easily
find
refuge
oh
i
grant
you
if
the
nautilus
had
emerged
from
the
strait
of
gibraltar
and
made
for
that
cape
in
the
south
if
it
were
taking
us
toward
those
regions
that
have
no
continents
then
id
share
your
alarm
but
we
now
know
that
captain
nemo
doesnt
avoid
the
seas
of
civilization
and
in
a
few
days
i
think
we
can
safely
take
action
ned
land
stared
at
me
still
more
intently
and
finally
unpursed
his
lips
well
do
it
this
evening
he
said
i
straightened
suddenly
i
admit
that
i
was
less
than
ready
for
this
announcement
i
wanted
to
reply
to
the
canadian
but
words
failed
me
we
agreed
to
wait
for
the
right
circumstances
ned
land
went
on
now
weve
got
those
circumstances
this
evening
well
be
just
a
few
miles
off
the
coast
of
spain
itll
be
cloudy
tonight
the
winds
blowing
toward
shore
you
gave
me
your
promise
professor
aronnax
and
im
counting
on
you
since
i
didnt
say
anything
the
canadian
stood
up
and
approached
me
well
do
it
this
evening
at
nine
oclock
he
said
ive
alerted
conseil
by
that
time
captain
nemo
will
be
locked
in
his
room
and
probably
in
bed
neither
the
mechanics
or
the
crewmen
will
be
able
to
see
us
conseil
and
i
will
go
to
the
central
companionway
as
for
you
professor
aronnax
youll
stay
in
the
library
two
steps
away
and
wait
for
my
signal
the
oars
mast
and
sail
are
in
the
skiff
ive
even
managed
to
stow
some
provisions
inside
ive
gotten
hold
of
a
monkey
wrench
to
unscrew
the
nuts
bolting
the
skiff
to
the
nautiluss
hull
so
everythings
ready
ill
see
you
this
evening
the
sea
is
rough
i
said
admitted
the
canadian
replied
but
weve
got
to
risk
it
freedom
is
worth
paying
for
besides
the
longboats
solidly
built
and
a
few
miles
with
the
wind
behind
us
is
no
big
deal
by
tomorrow
who
knows
if
this
ship
wont
be
100
leagues
out
to
sea
if
circumstances
are
in
our
favor
between
ten
and
eleven
this
evening
well
be
landing
on
some
piece
of
solid
ground
or
well
be
dead
so
were
in
gods
hands
and
ill
see
you
this
evening
this
said
the
canadian
withdrew
leaving
me
close
to
dumbfounded
i
had
imagined
that
if
it
came
to
this
i
would
have
time
to
think
about
it
to
talk
it
over
my
stubborn
companion
hadnt
granted
me
this
courtesy
but
after
all
what
would
i
have
said
to
him
ned
land
was
right
a
hundred
times
over
these
were
nearideal
circumstances
and
he
was
taking
full
advantage
of
them
in
my
selfish
personal
interests
could
i
go
back
on
my
word
and
be
responsible
for
ruining
the
future
lives
of
my
companions
tomorrow
might
not
captain
nemo
take
us
far
away
from
any
shore
just
then
a
fairly
loud
hissing
told
me
that
the
ballast
tanks
were
filling
and
the
nautilus
sank
beneath
the
waves
of
the
atlantic
i
stayed
in
my
stateroom
i
wanted
to
avoid
the
captain
to
hide
from
his
eyes
the
agitation
overwhelming
me
what
an
agonizing
day
i
spent
torn
between
my
desire
to
regain
my
free
will
and
my
regret
at
abandoning
this
marvelous
nautilus
leaving
my
underwater
research
incomplete
how
could
i
relinquish
this
oceanmy
own
atlantic
as
i
liked
to
call
itwithout
observing
its
lower
strata
without
wresting
from
it
the
kinds
of
secrets
that
had
been
revealed
to
me
by
the
seas
of
the
east
indies
and
the
pacific
i
was
putting
down
my
novel
half
read
i
was
waking
up
as
my
dream
neared
its
climax
how
painfully
the
hours
passed
as
i
sometimes
envisioned
myself
safe
on
shore
with
my
companions
or
despite
my
better
judgment
as
i
sometimes
wished
that
some
unforeseen
circumstances
would
prevent
ned
land
from
carrying
out
his
plans
twice
i
went
to
the
lounge
i
wanted
to
consult
the
compass
i
wanted
to
see
if
the
nautiluss
heading
was
actually
taking
us
closer
to
the
coast
or
spiriting
us
farther
away
but
no
the
nautilus
was
still
in
portuguese
waters
heading
north
it
was
cruising
along
the
oceans
beaches
so
i
had
to
resign
myself
to
my
fate
and
get
ready
to
escape
my
baggage
wasnt
heavy
my
notes
nothing
more
as
for
captain
nemo
i
wondered
what
he
would
make
of
our
escaping
what
concern
or
perhaps
what
distress
it
might
cause
him
and
what
he
would
do
in
the
twofold
event
of
our
attempt
either
failing
or
being
found
out
certainly
i
had
no
complaints
to
register
with
him
on
the
contrary
never
was
hospitality
more
wholehearted
than
his
yet
in
leaving
him
i
couldnt
be
accused
of
ingratitude
no
solemn
promises
bound
us
to
him
in
order
to
keep
us
captive
he
had
counted
only
on
the
force
of
circumstances
and
not
on
our
word
of
honor
but
his
avowed
intention
to
imprison
us
forever
on
his
ship
justified
our
every
effort
i
hadnt
seen
the
captain
since
our
visit
to
the
island
of
santorini
would
fate
bring
me
into
his
presence
before
our
departure
i
both
desired
and
dreaded
it
i
listened
for
footsteps
in
the
stateroom
adjoining
mine
not
a
sound
reached
my
ear
his
stateroom
had
to
be
deserted
then
i
began
to
wonder
if
this
eccentric
individual
was
even
on
board
since
that
night
when
the
skiff
had
left
the
nautilus
on
some
mysterious
mission
my
ideas
about
him
had
subtly
changed
in
spite
of
everything
i
thought
that
captain
nemo
must
have
kept
up
some
type
of
relationship
with
the
shore
did
he
himself
never
leave
the
nautilus
whole
weeks
had
often
gone
by
without
my
encountering
him
what
was
he
doing
all
the
while
during
all
those
times
id
thought
he
was
convalescing
in
the
grip
of
some
misanthropic
fit
was
he
instead
far
away
from
the
ship
involved
in
some
secret
activity
whose
nature
still
eluded
me
all
these
ideas
and
a
thousand
others
assaulted
me
at
the
same
time
in
these
strange
circumstances
the
scope
for
conjecture
was
unlimited
i
felt
an
unbearable
queasiness
this
day
of
waiting
seemed
endless
the
hours
struck
too
slowly
to
keep
up
with
my
impatience
as
usual
dinner
was
served
me
in
my
stateroom
full
of
anxiety
i
ate
little
i
left
the
table
at
seven
oclock
120
minutesi
was
keeping
track
of
themstill
separated
me
from
the
moment
i
was
to
rejoin
ned
land
my
agitation
increased
my
pulse
was
throbbing
violently
i
couldnt
stand
still
i
walked
up
and
down
hoping
to
calm
my
troubled
mind
with
movement
the
possibility
of
perishing
in
our
reckless
undertaking
was
the
least
of
my
worries
my
heart
was
pounding
at
the
thought
that
our
plans
might
be
discovered
before
we
had
left
the
nautilus
at
the
thought
of
being
hauled
in
front
of
captain
nemo
and
finding
him
angered
or
worse
saddened
by
my
deserting
him
i
wanted
to
see
the
lounge
one
last
time
i
went
down
the
gangways
and
arrived
at
the
museum
where
i
had
spent
so
many
pleasant
and
productive
hours
i
stared
at
all
its
wealth
all
its
treasures
like
a
man
on
the
eve
of
his
eternal
exile
a
man
departing
to
return
no
more
for
so
many
days
now
these
natural
wonders
and
artistic
masterworks
had
been
central
to
my
life
and
i
was
about
to
leave
them
behind
forever
i
wanted
to
plunge
my
eyes
through
the
lounge
window
and
into
these
atlantic
waters
but
the
panels
were
hermetically
sealed
and
a
mantle
of
sheet
iron
separated
me
from
this
ocean
with
which
i
was
still
unfamiliar
crossing
through
the
lounge
i
arrived
at
the
door
contrived
in
one
of
the
canted
corners
that
opened
into
the
captains
stateroom
much
to
my
astonishment
this
door
was
ajar
i
instinctively
recoiled
if
captain
nemo
was
in
his
stateroom
he
might
see
me
but
not
hearing
any
sounds
i
approached
the
stateroom
was
deserted
i
pushed
the
door
open
i
took
a
few
steps
inside
still
the
same
austere
monastic
appearance
just
then
my
eye
was
caught
by
some
etchings
hanging
on
the
wall
which
i
hadnt
noticed
during
my
first
visit
they
were
portraits
of
great
men
of
history
who
had
spent
their
lives
in
perpetual
devotion
to
a
great
human
ideal
thaddeus
kosciusko
the
hero
whose
dying
words
had
been
finis
poloniae
markos
botzaris
for
modern
greece
the
reincarnation
of
spartas
king
leonidas
daniel
oconnell
irelands
defender
george
washington
founder
of
the
american
union
daniele
manin
the
italian
patriot
abraham
lincoln
dead
from
the
bullet
of
a
believer
in
slavery
and
finally
that
martyr
for
the
redemption
of
the
black
race
john
brown
hanging
from
his
gallows
as
victor
hugos
pencil
has
so
terrifyingly
depicted
latin
save
polands
borders
ed
what
was
the
bond
between
these
heroic
souls
and
the
soul
of
captain
nemo
from
this
collection
of
portraits
could
i
finally
unravel
the
mystery
of
his
existence
was
he
a
fighter
for
oppressed
peoples
a
liberator
of
enslaved
races
had
he
figured
in
the
recent
political
or
social
upheavals
of
this
century
was
he
a
hero
of
that
dreadful
civil
war
in
america
a
war
lamentable
yet
forever
glorious




suddenly
the
clock
struck
eight
the
first
stroke
of
its
hammer
on
the
chime
snapped
me
out
of
my
musings
i
shuddered
as
if
some
invisible
eye
had
plunged
into
my
innermost
thoughts
and
i
rushed
outside
the
stateroom
there
my
eyes
fell
on
the
compass
our
heading
was
still
northerly
the
log
indicated
a
moderate
speed
the
pressure
gauge
a
depth
of
about
sixty
feet
so
circumstances
were
in
favor
of
the
canadians
plans
i
stayed
in
my
stateroom
i
dressed
warmly
fishing
boots
otter
cap
coat
of
fanmussel
fabric
lined
with
sealskin
i
was
ready
i
was
waiting
only
the
propellers
vibrations
disturbed
the
deep
silence
reigning
on
board
i
cocked
an
ear
and
listened
would
a
sudden
outburst
of
voices
tell
me
that
ned
lands
escape
plans
had
just
been
detected
a
ghastly
uneasiness
stole
through
me
i
tried
in
vain
to
recover
my
composure
a
few
minutes
before
nine
oclock
i
glued
my
ear
to
the
captains
door
not
a
sound
i
left
my
stateroom
and
returned
to
the
lounge
which
was
deserted
and
plunged
in
near
darkness
i
opened
the
door
leading
to
the
library
the
same
inadequate
light
the
same
solitude
i
went
to
man
my
post
near
the
door
opening
into
the
well
of
the
central
companionway
i
waited
for
ned
lands
signal
at
this
point
the
propellers
vibrations
slowed
down
appreciably
then
they
died
out
altogether
why
was
the
nautilus
stopping
whether
this
layover
would
help
or
hinder
ned
lands
schemes
i
couldnt
have
said
the
silence
was
further
disturbed
only
by
the
pounding
of
my
heart
suddenly
i
felt
a
mild
jolt
i
realized
the
nautilus
had
come
to
rest
on
the
ocean
floor
my
alarm
increased
the
canadians
signal
hadnt
reached
me
i
longed
to
rejoin
ned
land
and
urge
him
to
postpone
his
attempt
i
sensed
that
we
were
no
longer
navigating
under
normal
conditions
just
then
the
door
to
the
main
lounge
opened
and
captain
nemo
appeared
he
saw
me
and
without
further
preamble
ah
professor
he
said
in
an
affable
tone
ive
been
looking
for
you
do
you
know
your
spanish
history
even
if
he
knew
it
by
heart
a
man
in
my
disturbed
befuddled
condition
couldnt
have
quoted
a
syllable
of
his
own
countrys
history
well
captain
nemo
went
on
did
you
hear
my
question
do
you
know
the
history
of
spain
very
little
of
it
i
replied
the
most
learned
men
the
captain
said
still
have
much
to
learn
have
a
seat
he
added
and
ill
tell
you
about
an
unusual
episode
in
this
body
of
history
the
captain
stretched
out
on
a
couch
and
i
mechanically
took
a
seat
near
him
but
half
in
the
shadows
professor
he
said
listen
carefully
this
piece
of
history
concerns
you
in
one
definite
respect
because
it
will
answer
a
question
youve
no
doubt
been
unable
to
resolve
im
listening
captain
i
said
not
knowing
what
my
partner
in
this
dialogue
was
driving
at
and
wondering
if
this
incident
related
to
our
escape
plans
professor
captain
nemo
went
on
if
youre
amenable
well
go
back
in
time
to
1702
youre
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
those
days
your
king
louis
xiv
thought
an
imperial
gesture
would
suffice
to
humble
the
pyrenees
in
the
dust
so
he
inflicted
his
grandson
the
duke
of
anjou
on
the
spaniards
reigning
more
or
less
poorly
under
the
name
king
philip
v
this
aristocrat
had
to
deal
with
mighty
opponents
abroad
in
essence
the
year
before
the
royal
houses
of
holland
austria
and
england
had
signed
a
treaty
of
alliance
at
the
hague
aiming
to
wrest
the
spanish
crown
from
king
philip
v
and
to
place
it
on
the
head
of
an
archduke
whom
they
prematurely
dubbed
king
charles
iii
spain
had
to
withstand
these
allies
but
the
country
had
practically
no
army
or
navy
yet
it
wasnt
short
of
money
provided
that
its
galleons
laden
with
gold
and
silver
from
america
could
enter
its
ports
now
then
late
in
1702
spain
was
expecting
a
rich
convoy
which
france
ventured
to
escort
with
a
fleet
of
twentythree
vessels
under
the
command
of
admiral
de
chateaurenault
because
by
that
time
the
allied
navies
were
roving
the
atlantic
this
convoy
was
supposed
to
put
into
cadiz
but
after
learning
that
the
english
fleet
lay
across
those
waterways
the
admiral
decided
to
make
for
a
french
port
the
spanish
commanders
in
the
convoy
objected
to
this
decision
they
wanted
to
be
taken
to
a
spanish
port
if
not
to
cadiz
then
to
the
bay
of
vigo
located
on
spains
northwest
coast
and
not
blockaded
admiral
de
chateaurenault
was
so
indecisive
as
to
obey
this
directive
and
the
galleons
entered
the
bay
of
vigo
unfortunately
this
bay
forms
an
open
offshore
mooring
thats
impossible
to
defend
so
it
was
essential
to
hurry
and
empty
the
galleons
before
the
allied
fleets
arrived
and
there
would
have
been
ample
time
for
this
unloading
if
a
wretched
question
of
trade
agreements
hadnt
suddenly
come
up
are
you
clear
on
the
chain
of
events
captain
nemo
asked
me
perfectly
clear
i
said
not
yet
knowing
why
i
was
being
given
this
history
lesson
then
ill
continue
heres
what
came
to
pass
the
tradesmen
of
cadiz
had
negotiated
a
charter
whereby
they
were
to
receive
all
merchandise
coming
from
the
west
indies
now
then
unloading
the
ingots
from
those
galleons
at
the
port
of
vigo
would
have
been
a
violation
of
their
rights
so
they
lodged
a
complaint
in
madrid
and
they
obtained
an
order
from
the
indecisive
king
philip
v
without
unloading
the
convoy
would
stay
in
custody
at
the
offshore
mooring
of
vigo
until
the
enemy
fleets
had
retreated
now
then
just
as
this
decision
was
being
handed
down
english
vessels
arrived
in
the
bay
of
vigo
on
october
22
1702
despite
his
inferior
forces
admiral
de
chateaurenault
fought
courageously
but
when
he
saw
that
the
convoys
wealth
was
about
to
fall
into
enemy
hands
he
burned
and
scuttled
the
galleons
which
went
to
the
bottom
with
their
immense
treasures
captain
nemo
stopped
i
admit
it
i
still
couldnt
see
how
this
piece
of
history
concerned
me
well
i
asked
him
well
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
answered
me
were
actually
in
that
bay
of
vigo
and
all
thats
left
is
for
you
to
probe
the
mysteries
of
the
place
the
captain
stood
up
and
invited
me
to
follow
him
id
had
time
to
collect
myself
i
did
so
the
lounge
was
dark
but
the
seas
waves
sparkled
through
the
transparent
windows
i
stared
around
the
nautilus
for
a
halfmile
radius
the
waters
seemed
saturated
with
electric
light
the
sandy
bottom
was
clear
and
bright
dressed
in
diving
suits
crewmen
were
busy
clearing
away
halfrotted
barrels
and
disemboweled
trunks
in
the
midst
of
the
dingy
hulks
of
ships
out
of
these
trunks
and
kegs
spilled
ingots
of
gold
and
silver
cascades
of
jewels
pieces
of
eight
the
sand
was
heaped
with
them
then
laden
with
these
valuable
spoils
the
men
returned
to
the
nautilus
dropped
off
their
burdens
inside
and
went
to
resume
this
inexhaustible
fishing
for
silver
and
gold
i
understood
this
was
the
setting
of
that
battle
on
october
22
1702
here
in
this
very
place
those
galleons
carrying
treasure
to
the
spanish
government
had
gone
to
the
bottom
here
whenever
he
needed
captain
nemo
came
to
withdraw
these
millions
to
ballast
his
nautilus
it
was
for
him
for
him
alone
that
america
had
yielded
up
its
precious
metals
he
was
the
direct
sole
heir
to
these
treasures
wrested
from
the
incas
and
those
peoples
conquered
by
hernando
cortez
did
you
know
professor
he
asked
me
with
a
smile
that
the
sea
contained
such
wealth
i
know
its
estimated
i
replied
that
there
are
2000000
metric
tons
of
silver
held
in
suspension
in
seawater
surely
but
in
extracting
that
silver
your
expenses
would
outweigh
your
profits
here
by
contrast
i
have
only
to
pick
up
what
other
men
have
lost
and
not
only
in
this
bay
of
vigo
but
at
a
thousand
other
sites
where
ships
have
gone
down
whose
positions
are
marked
on
my
underwater
chart
do
you
understand
now
that
im
rich
to
the
tune
of
billions
i
understand
captain
nevertheless
allow
me
to
inform
you
that
by
harvesting
this
very
bay
of
vigo
youre
simply
forestalling
the
efforts
of
a
rival
organization
what
organization
a
company
chartered
by
the
spanish
government
to
search
for
these
sunken
galleons
the
companys
investors
were
lured
by
the
bait
of
enormous
gains
because
this
scuttled
treasure
is
estimated
to
be
worth
500000000
francs
it
was
500000000
francs
captain
nemo
replied
but
no
more
right
i
said
hence
a
timely
warning
to
those
investors
would
be
an
act
of
charity
yet
who
knows
if
it
would
be
well
received
usually
what
gamblers
regret
the
most
isnt
the
loss
of
their
money
so
much
as
the
loss
of
their
insane
hopes
but
ultimately
i
feel
less
sorry
for
them
than
for
the
thousands
of
unfortunate
people
who
would
have
benefited
from
a
fair
distribution
of
this
wealth
whereas
now
it
will
be
of
no
help
to
them
no
sooner
had
i
voiced
this
regret
than
i
felt
it
must
have
wounded
captain
nemo
no
help
he
replied
with
growing
animation
sir
what
makes
you
assume
this
wealth
goes
to
waste
when
im
the
one
amassing
it
do
you
think
i
toil
to
gather
this
treasure
out
of
selfishness
who
says
i
dont
put
it
to
good
use
do
you
think
im
unaware
of
the
suffering
beings
and
oppressed
races
living
on
this
earth
poor
people
to
comfort
victims
to
avenge
dont
you
understand




captain
nemo
stopped
on
these
last
words
perhaps
sorry
that
he
had
said
too
much
but
i
had
guessed
whatever
motives
had
driven
him
to
seek
independence
under
the
seas
he
remained
a
human
being
before
all
else
his
heart
still
throbbed
for
suffering
humanity
and
his
immense
philanthropy
went
out
both
to
downtrodden
races
and
to
individuals
and
now
i
knew
where
captain
nemo
had
delivered
those
millions
when
the
nautilus
navigated
the
waters
where
crete
was
in
rebellion
against
the
ottoman
empire
chapter

a
lost
continent
the
next
morning
february
19
i
beheld
the
canadian
entering
my
stateroom
i
was
expecting
this
visit
he
wore
an
expression
of
great
disappointment
well
sir
he
said
to
me
well
ned
the
fates
were
against
us
yesterday
yes
that
damned
captain
had
to
call
a
halt
just
as
we
were
going
to
escape
from
his
boat
yes
ned
he
had
business
with
his
bankers
his
bankers
or
rather
his
bank
vaults
by
which
i
mean
this
ocean
where
his
wealth
is
safer
than
in
any
national
treasury
i
then
related
the
evenings
incidents
to
the
canadian
secretly
hoping
he
would
come
around
to
the
idea
of
not
deserting
the
captain
but
my
narrative
had
no
result
other
than
neds
voicing
deep
regret
that
he
hadnt
strolled
across
the
vigo
battlefield
on
his
own
behalf
anyhow
he
said
its
not
over
yet
my
first
harpoon
missed
thats
all
well
succeed
the
next
time
and
as
soon
as
this
evening
if
need
be



whats
the
nautiluss
heading
i
asked
ive
no
idea
ned
replied
all
right
at
noon
well
find
out
what
our
position
is
the
canadian
returned
to
conseils
side
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
i
went
into
the
lounge
the
compass
wasnt
encouraging
the
nautiluss
course
was
southsouthwest
we
were
turning
our
backs
on
europe
i
could
hardly
wait
until
our
position
was
reported
on
the
chart
near
1130
the
ballast
tanks
emptied
and
the
submersible
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
i
leaped
onto
the
platform
ned
land
was
already
there
no
more
shore
in
sight
nothing
but
the
immenseness
of
the
sea
a
few
sails
were
on
the
horizon
no
doubt
ships
going
as
far
as
cape
so
roque
to
find
favorable
winds
for
doubling
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
sky
was
overcast
a
squall
was
on
the
way
furious
ned
tried
to
see
through
the
mists
on
the
horizon
he
still
hoped
that
behind
all
that
fog
there
lay
those
shores
he
longed
for
at
noon
the
sun
made
a
momentary
appearance
taking
advantage
of
this
rift
in
the
clouds
the
chief
officer
took
the
orbs
altitude
then
the
sea
grew
turbulent
we
went
below
again
and
the
hatch
closed
once
more
when
i
consulted
the
chart
an
hour
later
i
saw
that
the
nautiluss
position
was
marked
at
longitude
16
degrees
17
and
latitude
33
degrees
22
a
good
150
leagues
from
the
nearest
coast
it
wouldnt
do
to
even
dream
of
escaping
and
ill
let
the
reader
decide
how
promptly
the
canadian
threw
a
tantrum
when
i
ventured
to
tell
him
our
situation
as
for
me
i
wasnt
exactly
griefstricken
i
felt
as
if
a
heavy
weight
had
been
lifted
from
me
and
i
was
able
to
resume
my
regular
tasks
in
a
state
of
comparative
calm
near
eleven
oclock
in
the
evening
i
received
a
most
unexpected
visit
from
captain
nemo
he
asked
me
very
graciously
if
i
felt
exhausted
from
our
vigil
the
night
before
i
said
no
then
professor
aronnax
i
propose
an
unusual
excursion
propose
away
captain
so
far
youve
visited
the
ocean
depths
only
by
day
and
under
sunlight
would
you
like
to
see
these
depths
on
a
dark
night
very
much
i
warn
you
this
will
be
an
exhausting
stroll
well
need
to
walk
long
hours
and
scale
a
mountain
the
roads
arent
terribly
well
kept
up
everything
you
say
captain
just
increases
my
curiosity
im
ready
to
go
with
you
then
come
along
professor
and
well
go
put
on
our
diving
suits
arriving
at
the
wardrobe
i
saw
that
neither
my
companions
nor
any
crewmen
would
be
coming
with
us
on
this
excursion
captain
nemo
hadnt
even
suggested
my
fetching
ned
or
conseil
in
a
few
moments
we
had
put
on
our
equipment
air
tanks
abundantly
charged
were
placed
on
our
backs
but
the
electric
lamps
were
not
in
readiness
i
commented
on
this
to
the
captain
theyll
be
useless
to
us
he
replied
i
thought
i
hadnt
heard
him
right
but
i
couldnt
repeat
my
comment
because
the
captains
head
had
already
disappeared
into
its
metal
covering
i
finished
harnessing
myself
i
felt
an
alpenstock
being
placed
in
my
hand
and
a
few
minutes
later
after
the
usual
procedures
we
set
foot
on
the
floor
of
the
atlantic
300
meters
down
midnight
was
approaching
the
waters
were
profoundly
dark
but
captain
nemo
pointed
to
a
reddish
spot
in
the
distance
a
sort
of
wide
glow
shimmering
about
two
miles
from
the
nautilus
what
this
fire
was
what
substances
fed
it
how
and
why
it
kept
burning
in
the
liquid
mass
i
couldnt
say
anyhow
it
lit
our
way
although
hazily
but
i
soon
grew
accustomed
to
this
unique
gloom
and
in
these
circumstances
i
understood
the
uselessness
of
the
ruhmkorff
device
side
by
side
captain
nemo
and
i
walked
directly
toward
this
conspicuous
flame
the
level
seafloor
rose
imperceptibly
we
took
long
strides
helped
by
our
alpenstocks
but
in
general
our
progress
was
slow
because
our
feet
kept
sinking
into
a
kind
of
slimy
mud
mixed
with
seaweed
and
assorted
flat
stones
as
we
moved
forward
i
heard
a
kind
of
pitterpatter
above
my
head
sometimes
this
noise
increased
and
became
a
continuous
crackle
i
soon
realized
the
cause
it
was
a
heavy
rainfall
rattling
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
instinctively
i
worried
that
i
might
get
soaked
by
water
in
the
midst
of
water
i
couldnt
help
smiling
at
this
outlandish
notion
but
to
tell
the
truth
wearing
these
heavy
diving
suits
you
no
longer
feel
the
liquid
element
you
simply
think
youre
in
the
midst
of
air
a
little
denser
than
air
on
land
thats
all
after
half
an
hour
of
walking
the
seafloor
grew
rocky
jellyfish
microscopic
crustaceans
and
seapen
coral
lit
it
faintly
with
their
phosphorescent
glimmers
i
glimpsed
piles
of
stones
covered
by
a
couple
million
zoophytes
and
tangles
of
algae
my
feet
often
slipped
on
this
viscous
seaweed
carpet
and
without
my
alpenstock
i
would
have
fallen
more
than
once
when
i
turned
around
i
could
still
see
the
nautiluss
whitish
beacon
which
was
starting
to
grow
pale
in
the
distance
those
piles
of
stones
just
mentioned
were
laid
out
on
the
ocean
floor
with
a
distinct
but
inexplicable
symmetry
i
spotted
gigantic
furrows
trailing
off
into
the
distant
darkness
their
length
incalculable
there
also
were
other
peculiarities
i
couldnt
make
sense
of
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
heavy
lead
soles
were
crushing
a
litter
of
bones
that
made
a
dry
crackling
noise
so
what
were
these
vast
plains
we
were
now
crossing
i
wanted
to
ask
the
captain
but
i
still
didnt
grasp
that
sign
language
that
allowed
him
to
chat
with
his
companions
when
they
went
with
him
on
his
underwater
excursions
meanwhile
the
reddish
light
guiding
us
had
expanded
and
inflamed
the
horizon
the
presence
of
this
furnace
under
the
waters
had
me
extremely
puzzled
was
it
some
sort
of
electrical
discharge
was
i
approaching
some
natural
phenomenon
still
unknown
to
scientists
on
shore
or
rather
and
this
thought
did
cross
my
mind
had
the
hand
of
man
intervened
in
that
blaze
had
human
beings
fanned
those
flames
in
these
deep
strata
would
i
meet
up
with
more
of
captain
nemos
companions
friends
he
was
about
to
visit
who
led
lives
as
strange
as
his
own
would
i
find
a
whole
colony
of
exiles
down
here
men
tired
of
the
worlds
woes
men
who
had
sought
and
found
independence
in
the
oceans
lower
depths
all
these
insane
inadmissible
ideas
dogged
me
and
in
this
frame
of
mind
continually
excited
by
the
series
of
wonders
passing
before
my
eyes
i
wouldnt
have
been
surprised
to
find
on
this
sea
bottom
one
of
those
underwater
towns
captain
nemo
dreamed
about
our
path
was
getting
brighter
and
brighter
the
red
glow
had
turned
white
and
was
radiating
from
a
mountain
peak
about
800
feet
high
but
what
i
saw
was
simply
a
reflection
produced
by
the
crystal
waters
of
these
strata
the
furnace
that
was
the
source
of
this
inexplicable
light
occupied
the
far
side
of
the
mountain
in
the
midst
of
the
stone
mazes
furrowing
this
atlantic
seafloor
captain
nemo
moved
forward
without
hesitation
he
knew
this
dark
path
no
doubt
he
had
often
traveled
it
and
was
incapable
of
losing
his
way
i
followed
him
with
unshakeable
confidence
he
seemed
like
some
spirit
of
the
sea
and
as
he
walked
ahead
of
me
i
marveled
at
his
tall
figure
which
stood
out
in
black
against
the
glowing
background
of
the
horizon
it
was
one
oclock
in
the
morning
we
arrived
at
the
mountains
lower
gradients
but
in
grappling
with
them
we
had
to
venture
up
difficult
trails
through
a
huge
thicket
yes
a
thicket
of
dead
trees
trees
without
leaves
without
sap
turned
to
stone
by
the
action
of
the
waters
and
crowned
here
and
there
by
gigantic
pines
it
was
like
a
stillerect
coalfield
its
roots
clutching
broken
soil
its
boughs
clearly
outlined
against
the
ceiling
of
the
waters
like
thin
black
paper
cutouts
picture
a
forest
clinging
to
the
sides
of
a
peak
in
the
harz
mountains
but
a
submerged
forest
the
trails
were
cluttered
with
algae
and
fucus
plants
hosts
of
crustaceans
swarming
among
them
i
plunged
on
scaling
rocks
straddling
fallen
tree
trunks
snapping
marine
creepers
that
swayed
from
one
tree
to
another
startling
the
fish
that
flitted
from
branch
to
branch
carried
away
i
didnt
feel
exhausted
any
more
i
followed
a
guide
who
was
immune
to
exhaustion
what
a
sight
how
can
i
describe
it
how
can
i
portray
these
woods
and
rocks
in
this
liquid
setting
their
lower
parts
dark
and
sullen
their
upper
parts
tinted
red
in
this
light
whose
intensity
was
doubled
by
the
reflecting
power
of
the
waters
we
scaled
rocks
that
crumbled
behind
us
collapsing
in
enormous
sections
with
the
hollow
rumble
of
an
avalanche
to
our
right
and
left
there
were
carved
gloomy
galleries
where
the
eye
lost
its
way
huge
glades
opened
up
seemingly
cleared
by
the
hand
of
man
and
i
sometimes
wondered
whether
some
residents
of
these
underwater
regions
would
suddenly
appear
before
me
but
captain
nemo
kept
climbing
i
didnt
want
to
fall
behind
i
followed
him
boldly
my
alpenstock
was
a
great
help
one
wrong
step
would
have
been
disastrous
on
the
narrow
paths
cut
into
the
sides
of
these
chasms
but
i
walked
along
with
a
firm
tread
and
without
the
slightest
feeling
of
dizziness
sometimes
i
leaped
over
a
crevasse
whose
depth
would
have
made
me
recoil
had
i
been
in
the
midst
of
glaciers
on
shore
sometimes
i
ventured
out
on
a
wobbling
tree
trunk
fallen
across
a
gorge
without
looking
down
having
eyes
only
for
marveling
at
the
wild
scenery
of
this
region
there
leaning
on
erratically
cut
foundations
monumental
rocks
seemed
to
defy
the
laws
of
balance
from
between
their
stony

trees
sprang
up
like
jets
under
fearsome
pressure
supporting
other
trees
that
supported
them
in
turn
next
natural
towers
with
wide
steeply
carved
battlements
leaned
at
angles
that
on
dry
land
the
laws
of
gravity
would
never
have
authorized
and
i
too
could
feel
the
difference
created
by
the
waters
powerful
densitydespite
my
heavy
clothing
copper
headpiece
and
metal
soles
i
climbed
the
most
impossibly
steep
gradients
with
all
the
nimbleness
i
swear
it
of
a
chamois
or
a
pyrenees
mountain
goat
as
for
my
account
of
this
excursion
under
the
waters
im
well
aware
that
it
sounds
incredible
im
the
chronicler
of
deeds
seemingly
impossible
and
yet
incontestably
real
this
was
no
fantasy
this
was
what
i
saw
and
felt
two
hours
after
leaving
the
nautilus
we
had
cleared
the
timberline
and
100
feet
above
our
heads
stood
the
mountain
peak
forming
a
dark
silhouette
against
the
brilliant
glare
that
came
from
its
far
slope
petrified
shrubs
rambled
here
and
there
in
sprawling
zigzags
fish
rose
in
a
body
at
our
feet
like
birds
startled
in
tall
grass
the
rocky
mass
was
gouged
with
impenetrable
crevices
deep
caves
unfathomable
holes
at
whose
far
ends
i
could
hear
fearsome
things
moving
around
my
blood
would
curdle
as
i
watched
some
enormous
antenna
bar
my
path
or
saw
some
frightful
pincer
snap
shut
in
the
shadow
of
some
cavity
a
thousand
specks
of
light
glittered
in
the
midst
of
the
gloom
they
were
the
eyes
of
gigantic
crustaceans
crouching
in
their
lairs
giant
lobsters
rearing
up
like
spear
carriers
and
moving
their
claws
with
a
scrapiron
clanking
titanic
crabs
aiming
their
bodies
like
cannons
on
their
carriages
and
hideous
devilfish
intertwining
their
tentacles
like
bushes
of
writhing
snakes
what
was
this
astounding
world
that
i
didnt
yet
know
in
what
order
did
these
articulates
belong
these
creatures
for
which
the
rocks
provided
a
second
carapace
where
had
nature
learned
the
secret
of
their
vegetating
existence
and
for
how
many
centuries
had
they
lived
in
the
oceans
lower
strata
but
i
couldnt
linger
captain
nemo
on
familiar
terms
with
these
dreadful
animals
no
longer
minded
them
we
arrived
at
a
preliminary
plateau
where
still
other
surprises
were
waiting
for
me
there
picturesque
ruins
took
shape
betraying
the
hand
of
man
not
our
creator
they
were
huge
stacks
of
stones
in
which
you
could
distinguish
the
indistinct
forms
of
palaces
and
temples
now
arrayed
in
hosts
of
blossoming
zoophytes
and
over
it
all
not
ivy
but
a
heavy
mantle
of
algae
and
fucus
plants
but
what
part
of
the
globe
could
this
be
this
land
swallowed
by
cataclysms
who
had
set
up
these
rocks
and
stones
like
the
dolmens
of
prehistoric
times
where
was
i
where
had
captain
nemos
fancies
taken
me
i
wanted
to
ask
him
unable
to
i
stopped
him
i
seized
his
arm
but
he
shook
his
head
pointed
to
the
mountains
topmost
peak
and
seemed
to
tell
me
come
on
come
with
me
come
higher
i
followed
him
with
one
last
burst
of
energy
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
had
scaled
the
peak
which
crowned
the
whole
rocky
mass
by
some
ten
meters
i
looked
back
down
the
side
we
had
just
cleared
there
the
mountain
rose
only
700
to
800
feet
above
the
plains
but
on
its
far
slope
it
crowned
the
receding
bottom
of
this
part
of
the
atlantic
by
a
height
twice
that
my
eyes
scanned
the
distance
and
took
in
a
vast
area
lit
by
intense
flashes
of
light
in
essence
this
mountain
was
a
volcano
fifty
feet
below
its
peak
amid
a
shower
of
stones
and
slag
a
wide
crater
vomited
torrents
of
lava
that
were
dispersed
in
fiery
cascades
into
the
heart
of
the
liquid
mass
so
situated
this
volcano
was
an
immense
torch
that
lit
up
the
lower
plains
all
the
way
to
the
horizon
as
i
said
this
underwater
crater
spewed
lava
but
not
flames
flames
need
oxygen
from
the
air
and
are
unable
to
spread
underwater
but
a
lava
flow
which
contains
in
itself
the
principle
of
its
incandescence
can
rise
to
a
white
heat
overpower
the
liquid
element
and
turn
it
into
steam
on
contact
swift
currents
swept
away
all
this
diffuse
gas
and
torrents
of
lava
slid
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
like
the
disgorgings
of
a
mt
vesuvius
over
the
city
limits
of
a
second
torre
del
greco
in
fact
there
beneath
my
eyes
was
a
town
in
ruins
demolished
overwhelmed
laid
low
its
roofs
caved
in
its
temples
pulled
down
its
arches
dislocated
its
columns
stretching
over
the
earth
in
these
ruins
you
could
still
detect
the
solid
proportions
of
a
sort
of
tuscan
architecture
farther
off
the
remains
of
a
gigantic
aqueduct
here
the
caked
heights
of
an
acropolis
along
with
the
fluid
forms
of
a
parthenon
there
the
remnants
of
a
wharf
as
if
some
bygone
port
had
long
ago
harbored
merchant
vessels
and
tripletiered
war
galleys
on
the
shores
of
some
lost
ocean
still
farther
off
long
rows
of
collapsing
walls
deserted
thoroughfares
a
whole
pompeii
buried
under
the
waters
which
captain
nemo
had
resurrected
before
my
eyes
where
was
i
where
was
i
i
had
to
find
out
at
all
cost
i
wanted
to
speak
i
wanted
to
rip
off
the
copper
sphere
imprisoning
my
head
but
captain
nemo
came
over
and
stopped
me
with
a
gesture
then
picking
up
a
piece
of
chalky
stone
he
advanced
to
a
black
basaltic
rock
and
scrawled
this
one
word
atlantis
what
lightning
flashed
through
my
mind
atlantis
that
ancient
land
of
meropis
mentioned
by
the
historian
theopompus
platos
atlantis
the
continent
whose
very
existence
has
been
denied
by
such
philosophers
and
scientists
as
origen
porphyry
iamblichus
danville
maltebrun
and
humboldt
who
entered
its
disappearance
in
the
ledger
of
myths
and
folk
tales
the
country
whose
reality
has
nevertheless
been
accepted
by
such
other
thinkers
as
posidonius
pliny
ammianus
marcellinus
tertullian
engel
scherer
tournefort
buffon
and
davezac
i
had
this
land
right
under
my
eyes
furnishing
its
own
unimpeachable
evidence
of
the
catastrophe
that
had
overtaken
it
so
this
was
the
submerged
region
that
had
existed
outside
europe
asia
and
libya
beyond
the
pillars
of
hercules

of
those
powerful

whom
ancient

had
waged
its
earliest
wars

narratives

the
lofty
deeds
of
those
heroic
times

plato
himself
his
dialogues
timaeus
and
critias
were
drafted
with
the
poet
and
legislator
solon
as
their
inspiration
as
it
were
one
day
solon
was
conversing
with
some
elderly
wise
men
in
the
egyptian
capital
of
sais
a
town
already
8000
years
of
age
as
documented
by
the
annals
engraved
on
the
sacred
walls
of
its
temples
one
of
these
elders
related
the
history
of
another
town
1000
years
older
still
this
original
city
of
athens
ninety
centuries
old
had
been
invaded
and
partly
destroyed
by
the
atlanteans
these
atlanteans
he
said
resided
on
an
immense
continent
greater
than
africa
and
asia
combined
taking
in
an
area
that
lay
between
latitude
12
degrees
and
40
degrees
north
their
dominion
extended
even
to
egypt
they
tried
to
enforce
their
rule
as
far
as
greece
but
they
had
to
retreat
before
the
indomitable
resistance
of
the
hellenic
people
centuries
passed
a
cataclysm
occurredfloods
earthquakes
a
single
night
and
day
were
enough
to
obliterate
this
atlantis
whose
highest
peaks
madeira
the
azores
the
canaries
the
cape
verde
islands
still
emerge
above
the
waves
these
were
the
historical
memories
that
captain
nemos
scrawl
sent
rushing
through
my
mind
thus
led
by
the
strangest
of
fates
i
was
treading
underfoot
one
of
the
mountains
of
that
continent
my
hands
were
touching
ruins
many
thousands
of
years
old
contemporary
with
prehistoric
times
i
was
walking
in
the
very
place
where
contemporaries
of
early
man
had
walked
my
heavy
soles
were
crushing
the
skeletons
of
animals
from
the
age
of
fable
animals
that
used
to
take
cover
in
the
shade
of
these
trees
now
turned
to
stone
oh
why
was
i
so
short
of
time
i
would
have
gone
down
the
steep
slopes
of
this
mountain
crossed
this
entire
immense
continent
which
surely
connects
africa
with
america
and
visited
its
great
prehistoric
cities
under
my
eyes
there
perhaps
lay
the
warlike
town
of
makhimos
or
the
pious
village
of
eusebes
whose
gigantic
inhabitants
lived
for
whole
centuries
and
had
the
strength
to
raise
blocks
of
stone
that
still
withstood
the
action
of
the
waters
one
day
perhaps
some
volcanic
phenomenon
will
bring
these
sunken
ruins
back
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
numerous
underwater
volcanoes
have
been
sighted
in
this
part
of
the
ocean
and
many
ships
have
felt
terrific
tremors
when
passing
over
these
turbulent
depths
a
few
have
heard
hollow
noises
that
announced
some
struggle
of
the
elements
far
below
others
have
hauled
in
volcanic
ash
hurled
above
the
waves
as
far
as
the
equator
this
whole
seafloor
is
still
under
construction
by
plutonic
forces
and
in
some
remote
epoch
built
up
by
volcanic
disgorgings
and
successive
layers
of
lava
who
knows
whether
the
peaks
of
these
firebelching
mountains
may
reappear
above
the
surface
of
the
atlantic
as
i
mused
in
this
way
trying
to
establish
in
my
memory
every
detail
of
this
impressive
landscape
captain
nemo
was
leaning
his
elbows
on
a
mosscovered
monument
motionless
as
if
petrified
in
some
mute
trance
was
he
dreaming
of
those
lost
generations
asking
them
for
the
secret
of
human
destiny
was
it
here
that
this
strange
man
came
to
revive
himself
basking
in
historical
memories
reliving
that
bygone
life
he
who
had
no
desire
for
our
modern
one
i
would
have
given
anything
to
know
his
thoughts
to
share
them
understand
them
we
stayed
in
this
place
an
entire
hour
contemplating
its
vast
plains
in
the
lavas
glow
which
sometimes
took
on
a
startling
intensity
inner
boilings
sent
quick
shivers
running
through
the
mountains
crust
noises
from
deep
underneath
clearly
transmitted
by
the
liquid
medium
reverberated
with
majestic
amplitude
just
then
the
moon
appeared
for
an
instant
through
the
watery
mass
casting
a
few
pale
rays
over
this
submerged
continent
it
was
only
a
fleeting
glimmer
but
its
effect
was
indescribable
the
captain
stood
up
and
took
one
last
look
at
these
immense
plains
then
his
hand
signaled
me
to
follow
him
we
went
swiftly
down
the
mountain
once
past
the
petrified
forest
i
could
see
the
nautiluss
beacon
twinkling
like
a
star
the
captain
walked
straight
toward
it
and
we
were
back
on
board
just
as
the
first
glimmers
of
dawn
were
whitening
the
surface
of
the
ocean

i
overslept
i
was
so
exhausted
from
the
night
before
i
didnt
get
up
until
eleven
oclock
i
dressed
quickly
i
hurried
to
find
out
the
nautiluss
heading
the
instruments
indicated
that
it
was
running
southward
at
a
speed
of
twenty
miles
per
hour
and
a
depth
of
100
meters
conseil
entered
i
described
our
nocturnal
excursion
to
him
and
since
the
panels
were
open
he
could
still
catch
a
glimpse
of
this
submerged
continent
in
fact
the
nautilus
was
skimming
only
ten
meters
over
the
soil
of
these
atlantis
plains
the
ship
scudded
along
like
an
air
balloon
borne
by
the
wind
over
some
prairie
on
land
but
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
we
sat
in
the
lounge
as
if
we
were
riding
in
a
coach
on
an
express
train
as
for
the
foregrounds
passing
before
our
eyes
they
were
fantastically
carved
rocks
forests
of
trees
that
had
crossed
over
from
the
vegetable
kingdom
into
the
mineral
kingdom
their
motionless
silhouettes
sprawling
beneath
the
waves
there
also
were
stony
masses
buried
beneath
carpets
of
axidia
and
sea
anemone
bristling
with
long
vertical
water
plants
then
strangely
contoured
blocks
of
lava
that
testified
to
all
the
fury
of
those
plutonic
developments
while
this
bizarre
scenery
was
glittering
under
our
electric
beams
i
told
conseil
the
story
of

discussed
the
question

atlantis
with
the
fervor
of
a
man
who
no
longer
had
any
doubts
but
conseil
was
so
distracted
he
barely
heard
me
and
his
lack
of
interest
in
any
commentary
on
this
historical
topic
was

explained

caught

conseil
vanishes
into
his
world
of
classifying
and
leaves
real
life
behind
in
which
case
i
could
only
tag
along
and
resume
our
ichthyological
research
even
so
these
atlantic
fish
were
not
noticeably
different
from
those
we
had
observed
earlier
there
were
rays
of

rather
than
fish
eaters
obeying
the
tiniest
signals
from
their
females
like
henpecked
husbands
but
while
observing
these
different
specimens
of
marine
fauna
i
didnt
stop
examining
the
long
plains
of
atlantis
sometimes
an
unpredictable
irregularity
in
the
seafloor
would
force
the
nautilus
to
slow
down
and
then
it
would
glide
into
the
narrow
channels
between
the
hills
with
a
cetaceans
dexterity
if
the
labyrinth
became
hopelessly
tangled
the
submersible
would
rise
above
it
like
an
airship
and
after
clearing
the
obstacle
it
would
resume
its
speedy
course
just
a
few
meters
above
the
ocean
floor
it
was
an
enjoyable
and
impressive
way
of
navigating
that
did
indeed
recall
the
maneuvers
of
an
airship
ride
with
the
major
difference
that
the
nautilus
faithfully
obeyed
the
hands
of
its
helmsman
the
terrain
consisted
mostly
of
thick
slime
mixed
with
petrified
branches
but
it
changed
little
by
little
near
four
oclock
in
the
afternoon
it
grew
rockier
and
seemed
to
be
strewn
with
pudding
stones
and
a
basaltic
gravel
called
tuff
together
with
bits
of
lava
and
sulfurous
obsidian
i
expected
these
long
plains
to
change
into
mountain
regions
and
in
fact
as
the
nautilus
was
executing
certain
turns
i
noticed
that
the
southerly
horizon
was
blocked
by
a
high
wall
that
seemed
to
close
off
every
exit
its
summit
obviously
poked
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
it
had
to
be
a
continent
or
at
least
an
island
either
one
of
the
canaries
or
one
of
the
cape
verde
islands
our
bearings
hadnt
been
marked
on
the
chartperhaps
deliberatelyand
i
had
no
idea
what
our
position
was
in
any
case
this
wall
seemed
to
signal
the
end
of
atlantis
of
which
all
in
all
we
had
crossed
only
a
small
part
nightfall
didnt
interrupt
my
observations
i
was
left
to
myself
conseil
had
repaired
to
his
cabin
the
nautilus
slowed
down
hovering
above
the
muddled
masses
on
the
seafloor
sometimes
grazing
them
as
if
wanting
to
come
to
rest
sometimes
rising
unpredictably
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
then
i
glimpsed
a
few
bright
constellations
through
the
crystal
waters
specifically
five
or
six
of
those
zodiacal
stars
trailing
from
the
tail
end
of
orion
i
would
have
stayed
longer
at
my
window
marveling
at
these
beauties
of
sea
and
sky
but
the
panels
closed
just
then
the
nautilus
had
arrived
at
the
perpendicular
face
of
that
high
wall
how
the
ship
would
maneuver
i
hadnt
a
guess
i
repaired
to
my
stateroom
the
nautilus
did
not
stir
i
fell
asleep
with
the
firm
intention
of
waking
up
in
just
a
few
hours
but
it
was
eight
oclock
the
next
day
when
i
returned
to
the
lounge
i
stared
at
the
pressure
gauge
it
told
me
that
the
nautilus
was
afloat
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
furthermore
i
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
platform
yet
there
were
no
rolling
movements
to
indicate
the
presence
of
waves
undulating
above
me
i
climbed
as
far
as
the
hatch
it
was
open
but
instead
of
the
broad
daylight
i
was
expecting
i
found
that
i
was
surrounded
by
total
darkness
where
were
we
had
i
been
mistaken
was
it
still
night
no
not
one
star
was
twinkling
and
nighttime
is
never
so
utterly
black
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
when
a
voice
said
to
me
is
that
you
professor
ah
captain
nemo
i
replied
where
are
we
underground
professor
underground
i
exclaimed
and
the
nautilus
is
still
floating
it
always
floats
but
i
dont
understand
wait
a
little
while
our
beacon
is
about
to
go
on
and
if
you
want
some
light
on
the
subject
youll
be
satisfied
i
set
foot
on
the
platform
and
waited
the
darkness
was
so
profound
i
couldnt
see
even
captain
nemo
however
looking
at
the
zenith
directly
overhead
i
thought
i
caught
sight
of
a
feeble
glimmer
a
sort
of
twilight
filtering
through
a
circular
hole
just
then
the
beacon
suddenly
went
on
and
its
intense
brightness
made
that
hazy
light
vanish
this
stream
of
electricity
dazzled
my
eyes
and
after
momentarily
shutting
them
i
looked
around
the
nautilus
was
stationary
it
was
floating
next
to
an
embankment
shaped
like
a
wharf
as
for
the
water
now
buoying
the
ship
it
was
a
lake
completely
encircled
by
an
inner
wall
about
two
miles
in
diameter
hence
six
miles
around
its
levelas
indicated
by
the
pressure
gaugewould
be
the
same
as
the
outside
level
because
some
connection
had
to
exist
between
this
lake
and
the
sea
slanting
inward
over
their
base
these
high
walls
converged
to
form
a
vault
shaped
like
an
immense
upsidedown
funnel
that
measured
500
or
600
meters
in
height
at
its
summit
there
gaped
the
circular
opening
through
which
i
had
detected
that
faint
glimmer
obviously
daylight
before
more
carefully
examining
the
interior
features
of
this
enormous
cavern
and
before
deciding
if
it
was
the
work
of
nature
or
humankind
i
went
over
to
captain
nemo
where
are
we
i
said
in
the
very
heart
of
an
extinct
volcano
the
captain
answered
me
a
volcano
whose
interior
was
invaded
by
the
sea
after
some
convulsion
in
the
earth
while
you
were
sleeping
professor
the
nautilus
entered
this
lagoon
through
a
natural
channel
that
opens
ten
meters
below
the
surface
of
the
ocean
this
is
our
home
port
secure
convenient
secret
and
sheltered
against
winds
from
any
direction
along
the
coasts
of
your
continents
or
islands
show
me
any
offshore
mooring
that
can
equal
this
safe
refuge
for
withstanding
the
fury
of
hurricanes
indeed
i
replied
here
youre
in
perfect
safety
captain
nemo
who
could
reach
you
in
the
heart
of
a
volcano
but
dont
i
see
an
opening
at
its
summit
yes
its
crater
a
crater
formerly
filled
with
lava
steam
and
flames
but
which
now
lets
in
this
lifegiving
air
were
breathing
but
which
volcanic
mountain
is
this
i
asked
its
one
of
the
many
islets
with
which
this
sea
is
strewn
for
ships
a
mere
reef
for
us
an
immense
cavern
i
discovered
it
by
chance
and
chance
served
me
well
but
couldnt
someone
enter
through
the
mouth
of
its
crater
no
more
than
i
could
exit
through
it
you
can
climb
about
100
feet
up
the
inner
base
of
this
mountain
but
then
the
walls
overhang
they
lean
too
far
in
to
be
scaled
i
can
see
captain
that
nature
is
your
obedient
servant
any
time
or
any
place
youre
safe
on
this
lake
and
nobody
else
can
visit
its
waters
but
whats
the
purpose
of
this
refuge
the
nautilus
doesnt
need
a
harbor
no
professor
but
it
needs
electricity
to
run
batteries
to
generate
its
electricity
sodium
to
feed
its
batteries
coal
to
make
its
sodium
and
coalfields
from
which
to
dig
its
coal
now
then
right
at
this
spot
the
sea
covers
entire
forests
that
sank
underwater
in
prehistoric
times
today
turned
to
stone
transformed
into
carbon
fuel
they
offer
me
inexhaustible
coal
mines
so
captain
your
men
practice
the
trade
of
miners
here
precisely
these
mines
extend
under
the
waves
like
the
coalfields
at
newcastle
here
dressed
in
diving
suits
pick
and
mattock
in
hand
my
men
go
out
and
dig
this
carbon
fuel
for
which
i
dont
need
a
single
mine
on
land
when
i
burn
this
combustible
to
produce
sodium
the
smoke
escaping
from
the
mountains
crater
gives
it
the
appearance
of
a
stillactive
volcano
and
will
we
see
your
companions
at
work
no
at
least
not
this
time
because
im
eager
to
continue
our
underwater
tour
of
the
world
accordingly
ill
rest
content
with
drawing
on
my
reserve
stock
of
sodium
well
stay
here
long
enough
to
load
it
on
board
in
other
words
a
single
workday
then
well
resume
our
voyage
so
professor
aronnax
if
youd
like
to
explore
this
cavern
and
circle
its
lagoon
seize
the
day
i
thanked
the
captain
and
went
to
look
for
my
two
companions
who
hadnt
yet
left
their
cabin
i
invited
them
to
follow
me
not
telling
them
where
we
were
they
climbed
onto
the
platform
conseil
whom
nothing
could
startle
saw
it
as
a
perfectly
natural
thing
to
fall
asleep
under
the
waves
and
wake
up
under
a
mountain
but
ned
land
had
no
idea
in
his
head
other
than
to
see
if
this
cavern
offered
some
way
out
after
breakfast
near
ten
oclock
we
went
down
onto
the
embankment
so
here
we
are
back
on
shore
conseil
said
id
hardly
call
this
shore
the
canadian
replied
and
besides
we
arent
on
it
but
under
it
a
sandy
beach
unfolded
before
us
measuring
500
feet
at
its
widest
point
between
the
waters
of
the
lake
and
the
foot
of
the
mountains
walls
via
this
strand
you
could
easily
circle
the
lake
but
the
base
of
these
high
walls
consisted
of
broken
soil
over
which
there
lay
picturesque
piles
of
volcanic
blocks
and
enormous
pumice
stones
all
these
crumbling
masses
were
covered
with
an
enamel
polished
by
the
action
of
underground
fires
and
they
glistened
under
the
stream
of
electric
light
from
our
beacon
stirred
up
by
our
footsteps
the
micarich
dust
on
this
beach
flew
into
the
air
like
a
cloud
of
sparks
the
ground
rose
appreciably
as
it
moved
away
from
the
sand
flats
by
the
waves
and
we
soon
arrived
at
some
long
winding
gradients
genuinely
steep
paths
that
allowed
us
to
climb
little
by
little
but
we
had
to
tread
cautiously
in
the
midst
of
pudding
stones
that
werent
cemented
together
and
our
feet
kept
skidding
on
glassy
trachyte
made
of
feldspar
and
quartz
crystals
the
volcanic
nature
of
this
enormous
pit
was
apparent
all
around
us
i
ventured
to
comment
on
it
to
my
companions
can
you
picture
i
asked
them
what
this
funnel
must
have
been
like
when
it
was
filled
with
boiling
lava
and
the
level
of
that
incandescent
liquid
rose
right
to
the
mountains
mouth
like
cast
iron
up
the
insides
of
a
furnace
i
can
picture
it
perfectly
conseil
replied
but
will
master
tell
me
why
this
huge
smelter
suspended
operations
and
how
it
is
that
an
oven
was
replaced
by
the
tranquil
waters
of
a
lake
in
all
likelihood
conseil
because
some
convulsion
created
an
opening
below
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
opening
that
serves
as
a
passageway
for
the
nautilus
then
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
rushed
inside
the
mountain
there
ensued
a
dreadful
struggle
between
the
elements
of
fire
and
water
a
struggle
ending
in
king
neptunes
favor
but
many
centuries
have
passed
since
then
and
this
submerged
volcano
has
changed
into
a
peaceful
cavern
thats
fine
ned
land
answered
i
accept
the
explanation
but
in
our
personal
interests
im
sorry
this
opening
the
professor
mentions
wasnt
made
above
sea
level
but
ned
my
friend
conseil
answered
if
it
werent
an
underwater
passageway
the
nautilus
couldnt
enter
it
and
i
might
add
mr
land
i
said
that
the
waters
wouldnt
have
rushed
under
the
mountain
and
the
volcano
would
still
be
a
volcano
so
you
have
nothing
to
be
sorry
about
our
climb
continued
the
gradients
got
steeper
and
narrower
sometimes
they
were
cut
across
by
deep
pits
that
had
to
be
cleared
masses
of
overhanging
rock
had
to
be
gotten
around
you
slid
on
your
knees
you
crept
on
your
belly
but
helped
by
the
canadians
strength
and
conseils
dexterity
we
overcame
every
obstacle
at
an
elevation
of
about
thirty
meters
the
nature
of
the
terrain
changed
without
becoming
any
easier
pudding
stones
and
trachyte
gave
way
to
black
basaltic
rock
here
lying
in
slabs
all
swollen
with
blisters
there
shaped
like
actual
prisms
and
arranged
into
a
series
of
columns
that
supported
the
springings
of
this
immense
vault
a
wonderful
sample
of
natural
architecture
then
among
this
basaltic
rock
there
snaked
long
hardened
lava
flows
inlaid
with
veins
of
bituminous
coal
and
in
places
covered
by
wide
carpets
of
sulfur
the
sunshine
coming
through
the
crater
had
grown
stronger
shedding
a
hazy
light
over
all
the
volcanic
waste
forever
buried
in
the
heart
of
this
extinct
mountain
but
when
we
had
ascended
to
an
elevation
of
about
250
feet
we
were
stopped
by
insurmountable
obstacles
the
converging
inside
walls
changed
into
overhangs
and
our
climb
into
a
circular
stroll
at
this
topmost
level
the
vegetable
kingdom
began
to
challenge
the
mineral
kingdom
shrubs
and
even
a
few
trees
emerged
from
crevices
in
the
walls
i
recognized
some
spurges
that
let
their
caustic
purgative
sap
trickle
out
there
were
heliotropes
very
remiss
at
living
up
to
their
sunworshipping
reputations
since
no
sunlight
ever
reached
them
their
clusters
of
flowers
drooped
sadly
their
colors
and
scents
were
faded
here
and
there
chrysanthemums
sprouted
timidly
at
the
feet
of
aloes
with
long
sad
sickly
leaves
but
between
these
lava
flows
i
spotted
little
violets
that
still
gave
off
a
subtle
fragrance
and
i
confess
that
i
inhaled
it
with
delight
the
soul
of
a
flower
is
its
scent
and
those
splendid
water
plants
flowers
of
the
sea
have
no
souls
we
had
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
sturdy
clump
of
dragon
trees
which
were
splitting
the
rocks
with
exertions
of
their
muscular
roots
when
ned
land
exclaimed
oh
sir
a
hive
a
hive
i
answered
with
a
gesture
of
utter
disbelief
yes
a
hive
the
canadian
repeated
with
bees
buzzing
around
i
went
closer
and
was
forced
to
recognize
the
obvious
at
the
mouth
of
a
hole
cut
in
the
trunk
of
a
dragon
tree
there
swarmed
thousands
of
these
ingenious
insects
so
common
to
all
the
canary
islands
where
their
output
is
especially
prized
naturally
enough
the
canadian
wanted
to
lay
in
a
supply
of
honey
and
it
would
have
been
illmannered
of
me
to
say
no
he
mixed
sulfur
with
some
dry
leaves
set
them
on
fire
with
a
spark
from
his
tinderbox
and
proceeded
to
smoke
the
bees
out
little
by
little
the
buzzing
died
down
and
the
disemboweled
hive
yielded
several
pounds
of
sweet
honey
ned
land
stuffed
his
haversack
with
it
when
ive
mixed
this
honey
with
our
breadfruit
batter
he
told
us
ill
be
ready
to
serve
you
a
delectable
piece
of
cake
but
of
course
conseil
put
in
it
will
be
gingerbread
im
all
for
gingerbread
i
said
but
lets
resume
this
fascinating
stroll
at
certain
turns
in
the
trail
we
were
going
along
the
lake
appeared
in
its
full
expanse
the
ships
beacon
lit
up
that
whole
placid
surface
which
experienced
neither
ripples
nor
undulations
the
nautilus
lay
perfectly
still
on
its
platform
and
on
the
embankment
crewmen
were
bustling
around
black
shadows
that
stood
out
clearly
in
the
midst
of
the
luminous
air
just
then
we
went
around
the
highest
ridge
of
these
rocky
foothills
that
supported
the
vault
then
i
saw
that
bees
werent
the
animal
kingdoms
only
representatives
inside
this
volcano
here
and
in
the
shadows
birds
of
prey
soared
and
whirled
flying
away
from
nests
perched
on
tips
of
rock
there
were
sparrow
hawks
with
white
bellies
and
screeching
kestrels
with
all
the
speed
their
stiltlike
legs
could
muster
fine
fat
bustards
scampered
over
the
slopes
ill
let
the
reader
decide
whether
the
canadians
appetite
was
aroused
by
the
sight
of
this
tasty
game
and
whether
he
regretted
having
no
rifle
in
his
hands
he
tried
to
make
stones
do
the
work
of
bullets
and
after
several
fruitless
attempts
he
managed
to
wound
one
of
these
magnificent
bustards
to
say
he
risked
his
life
twenty
times
in
order
to
capture
this
bird
is
simply
the
unadulterated
truth
but
he
fared
so
well
the
animal
went
into
his
sack
to
join
the
honeycombs
by
then
we
were
forced
to
go
back
down
to
the
beach
because
the
ridge
had
become
impossible
above
us
the
yawning
crater
looked
like
the
wide
mouth
of
a
well
from
where
we
stood
the
sky
was
pretty
easy
to
see
and
i
watched
clouds
race
by
disheveled
by
the
west
wind
letting
tatters
of
mist
trail
over
the
mountains
summit
proof
positive
that
those
clouds
kept
at
a
moderate
altitude
because
this
volcano
didnt
rise
more
than
1800
feet
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
half
an
hour
after
the
canadians
latest
exploits
we
were
back
on
the
inner
beach
there
the
local
flora
was
represented
by
a
wide
carpet
of
samphire
a
small
umbelliferous
plant
that
keeps
quite
nicely
which
also
boasts
the
names
glasswort
saxifrage
and
sea
fennel
conseil
picked
a
couple
bunches
as
for
the
local
fauna
it
included
thousands
of
crustaceans
of
every
type
lobsters
hermit
crabs
prawns
mysid
shrimps
daddy
longlegs
rock
crabs
and
a
prodigious
number
of
seashells
such
as
cowries
murex
snails
and
limpets
in
this
locality
there
gaped
the
mouth
of
a
magnificent
cave
my
companions
and
i
took
great
pleasure
in
stretching
out
on
its
finegrained
sand
fire
had
polished
the
sparkling
enamel
of
its
inner
walls
sprinkled
all
over
with
micarich
dust
ned
land
tapped
these
walls
and
tried
to
probe
their
thickness
i
couldnt
help
smiling
our
conversation
then
turned
to
his
everlasting
escape
plans
and
without
going
too
far
i
felt
i
could
offer
him
this
hope
captain
nemo
had
gone
down
south
only
to
replenish
his
sodium
supplies
so
i
hoped
he
would
now
hug
the
coasts
of
europe
and
america
which
would
allow
the
canadian
to
try
again
with
a
greater
chance
of
success
we
were
stretched
out
in
this
delightful
cave
for
an
hour
our
conversation
lively
at
the
outset
then
languished
a
definite
drowsiness
overcame
us
since
i
saw
no
good
reason
to
resist
the
call
of
sleep
i
fell
into
a
heavy
doze
i
dreamedone
doesnt
choose
his
dreamsthat
my
life
had
been
reduced
to
the
vegetating
existence
of
a
simple
mollusk
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
cave
made
up
my
doublevalved
shell



suddenly
conseils
voice
startled
me
awake
get
up
get
up
shouted
the
fine
lad
what
is
it
i
asked
in
a
sitting
position
the
waters
coming
up
to
us
i
got
back
on
my
feet
like
a
torrent
the
sea
was
rushing
into
our
retreat
and
since
we
definitely
were
not
mollusks
we
had
to
clear
out
in
a
few
seconds
we
were
safe
on
top
of
the
cave
what
happened
conseil
asked
some
new
phenomenon
not
quite
my
friends
i
replied
it
was
the
tide
merely
the
tide
which
wellnigh
caught
us
by
surprise
just
as
it
did
sir
walter
scotts
hero
the
ocean
outside
is
rising
and
by
a
perfectly
natural
law
of
balance
the
level
of
this
lake
is
also
rising
weve
gotten
off
with
a
mild
dunking
lets
go
change
clothes
on
the
nautilus
threequarters
of
an
hour
later
we
had
completed
our
circular
stroll
and
were
back
on
board
just
then
the
crewmen
finished
loading
the
sodium
supplies
and
the
nautilus
could
have
departed
immediately
but
captain
nemo
gave
no
orders
would
he
wait
for
nightfall
and
exit
through
his
underwater
passageway
in
secrecy
perhaps
be
that
as
it
may
by
the
next
day
the
nautilus
had
left
its
home
port
and
was
navigating
well
out
from
any
shore
a
few
meters
beneath
the
waves
of
the
atlantic
chapter

the
sargasso
sea
the
nautilus
didnt
change
direction
for
the
time
being
then
we
had
to
set
aside
any
hope
of
returning
to
european
seas
captain
nemo
kept
his
prow
pointing
south
where
was
he
taking
us
i
was
afraid
to
guess
that
day
the
nautilus
crossed
an
odd
part
of
the
atlantic
ocean
no
one
is
unaware
of
the
existence
of
that
great
warmwater
current
known
by
name
as
the
gulf
stream
after
emerging
from
channels
off
florida
it
heads
toward
spitzbergen
but
before
entering
the
gulf
of
mexico
near
latitude
44
degrees
north
this
current
divides
into
two
arms
its
chief
arm
makes
for
the
shores
of
ireland
and
norway
while
the
second
flexes
southward
at
the
level
of
the
azores
then
it
hits
the
coast
of
africa
sweeps
in
a
long
oval
and
returns
to
the
caribbean
sea
now
then
this
second
armmore
accurately
a
collarforms
a
ring
of
warm
water
around
a
section
of
cool
tranquil
motionless
ocean
called
the
sargasso
sea
this
is
an
actual
lake
in
the
open
atlantic
and
the
great
currents
waters
take
at
least
three
years
to
circle
it
properly
speaking
the
sargasso
sea
covers
every
submerged
part
of
atlantis
certain
authors
have
even
held
that
the
many
weeds
strewn
over
this
sea
were
torn
loose
from
the
prairies
of
that
ancient
continent
but
its
more
likely
that
these
grasses
algae
and
fucus
plants
were
carried
off
from
the
beaches
of
europe
and
america
then
taken
as
far
as
this
zone
by
the
gulf
stream
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
christopher
columbus
assumed
the
existence
of
a
new
world
when
the
ships
of
that
bold
investigator
arrived
in
the
sargasso
sea
they
had
great
difficulty
navigating
in
the
midst
of
these
weeds
which
much
to
their
crews
dismay
slowed
them
down
to
a
halt
and
they
wasted
three
long
weeks
crossing
this
sector
such
was
the
region
our
nautilus
was
visiting
just
then
a
genuine
prairie
a
tightly
woven
carpet
of
algae
gulfweed
and
bladder
wrack
so
dense
and
compact
a

couldnt
tear
through
it
without
difficulty

to
entangle
his

in
this
weedchoked
mass
captain
nemo
stayed
at
a
depth
some
meters
below
the
surface
of
the
waves
the
name
sargasso
comes
from
the
spanish
word
sargazo
meaning
gulfweed
this
gulfweed
the
swimming
gulfweed
or
berry
carrier
is
the
chief
substance
making
up
this
immense
shoal
and
heres
why
these

plants
collect
in
this

to
the
expert
on
the
subject
commander
maury
author
of
the
physical
geography
of
the
sea
the
explanation
he
gives
seems
to
entail
a
set
of
conditions
that
everybody
knows
now
maury
says
if
bits
of
cork
or
chaff
or
any
floating
substance
be
put
into
a
basin
and
a

motion
be
given
to
the

all
the
light
substances
will
be
found
crowding
together
near
the

of
the

where
there
is
the

maurys
view
and
i
was
able
to
study
the
phenomenon
in
this
exclusive
setting
where
ships
rarely
go
above
us
huddled
among
the
brown
weeds
there
floated
objects
originating
from
all
over
tree
trunks
ripped
from
the
rocky
mountains
or
the
andes
and
sent
floating
down
the
amazon
or
the
mississippi
numerous
pieces
of
wreckage
remnants
of
keels
or
undersides
bulwarks
staved
in
and
so
weighed
down
with
seashells
and
barnacles
they
couldnt
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
and
the
passing
years
will
someday
bear
out
maurys
other
view
that
by
collecting
in
this
way
over
the
centuries
these
substances
will
be
turned
to
stone
by
the
action
of
the
waters
and
will
then
form
inexhaustible
coalfields
valuable
reserves
prepared
by
farseeing
nature
for
that
time
when
man
will
have
exhausted
his
mines
on
the
continents
in
the
midst
of
this
hopelessly
tangled
fabric
of
weeds
and
fucus
plants
i
noted
some
delightful
pinkcolored
starshaped
alcyon
coral
sea
anemone
trailing
the
long
tresses
of
their
tentacles
some
green
red
and
blue
jellyfish
and
especially
those
big
rhizostome
jellyfish
that
cuvier
described
whose
bluish
parasols
are
trimmed
with
violet
festoons
we
spent
the
whole
day
of
february
22
in
the
sargasso
sea
where
fish
that
dote
on
marine
plants
and
crustaceans
find
plenty
to
eat
the
next
day
the
ocean
resumed
its
usual
appearance
from
this
moment
on
for
nineteen
days
from
february
23
to
march
12
the
nautilus
stayed
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
hustling
us
along
at
a
constant
speed
of
100
leagues
every
twentyfour
hours
it
was
obvious
that
captain
nemo
wanted
to
carry
out
his
underwater
program
and
i
had
no
doubt
that
he
intended
after
doubling
cape
horn
to
return
to
the
pacific
south
seas
so
ned
land
had
good
reason
to
worry
in
these
wide
seas
empty
of
islands
it
was
no
longer
feasible
to
jump
ship
nor
did
we
have
any
way
to
counter
captain
nemos
whims
we
had
no
choice
but
to
acquiesce
but
if
we
couldnt
attain
our
end
through
force
or
cunning
i
liked
to
think
we
might
achieve
it
through
persuasion
once
this
voyage
was
over
might
not
captain
nemo
consent
to
set
us
free
in
return
for
our
promise
never
to
reveal
his
existence
our
word
of
honor
which
we
sincerely
would
have
kept
however
this
delicate
question
would
have
to
be
negotiated
with
the
captain
but
how
would
he
receive
our
demands
for
freedom
at
the
very
outset
and
in
no
uncertain
terms
hadnt
he
declared
that
the
secret
of
his
life
required
that
we
be
permanently
imprisoned
on
board
the
nautilus
wouldnt
he
see
my
fourmonth
silence
as
a
tacit
acceptance
of
this
situation
would
my
returning
to
this
subject
arouse
suspicions
that
could
jeopardize
our
escape
plans
if
we
had
promising
circumstances
for
trying
again
later
on
i
weighed
all
these
considerations
turned
them
over
in
my
mind
submitted
them
to
conseil
but
he
was
as
baffled
as
i
was
in
short
although
im
not
easily
discouraged
i
realized
that
my
chances
of
ever
seeing
my
fellow
men
again
were
shrinking
by
the
day
especially
at
a
time
when
captain
nemo
was
recklessly
racing
toward
the
south
atlantic
during
those
nineteen
days
just
mentioned
no
unique
incidents
distinguished
our
voyage
i
saw
little
of
the
captain
he
was
at
work
in
the
library
i
often
found
books
he
had
left
open
especially
books
on
natural
history
he
had
thumbed
through
my
work
on
the
great
ocean
depths
and
the
margins
were
covered
with
his
notes
which
sometimes
contradicted
my
theories
and
formulations
but
the
captain
remained
content
with
this
method
of
refining
my
work
and
he
rarely
discussed
it
with
me
sometimes
i
heard
melancholy
sounds
reverberating
from
the
organ
which
he
played
very
expressively
but
only
at
night
in
the
midst
of
the
most
secretive
darkness
while
the
nautilus
slumbered
in
the
wilderness
of
the
ocean
during
this
part
of
our
voyage
we
navigated
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
for
entire
days
the
sea
was
nearly
deserted
a
few
sailing
ships
laden
for
the
east
indies
were
heading
toward
the
cape
of
good
hope
one
day
we
were
chased
by
the
longboats
of
a
whaling
vessel
which
undoubtedly
viewed
us
as
some
enormous
baleen
whale
of
great
value
but
captain
nemo
didnt
want
these
gallant
gentlemen
wasting
their
time
and
energy
so
he
ended
the
hunt
by
diving
beneath
the
waters
this
incident
seemed
to
fascinate
ned
land
intensely
im
sure
the
canadian
was
sorry
that
these
fishermen
couldnt
harpoon
our
sheetiron
cetacean
and
mortally
wound
it
during
this
period
the
fish
conseil
and
i
observed
differed
little
from
those
we
had
already
studied
in
other
latitudes
chief
among
them
were
specimens
of
that
dreadful
cartilaginous
genus
thats
divided
into
three
subgenera
numbering
at
least
thirtytwo
species
striped
sharks
five
meters
long
the
head
squat
and
wider
than
the
body
the
caudal
fin
curved
the
back
with
seven
big
black
parallel
lines
running
lengthwise
then
perlon
sharks
ash
gray
pierced
with
seven
gill
openings
furnished
with
a
single
dorsal
fin
placed
almost
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
body
some
big
dogfish
also
passed
by
a
voracious
species
of
shark
if
there
ever
was
one
with
some
justice
fishermens
yarns
arent
to
be
trusted
but
heres
what
a
few
of
them
relate
inside
the
corpse
of
one
of
these
animals
there
were
found
a
buffalo
head
and
a
whole
calf
in
another
two
tuna
and
a
sailor
in
uniform
in
yet
another
a
soldier
with
his
saber
in
another
finally
a
horse
with
its
rider
in
candor
none
of
these
sounds
like
divinely
inspired
truth
but
the
fact
remains
that
not
a
single
dogfish
let
itself
get
caught
in
the
nautiluss
nets
so
i
cant
vouch
for
their
voracity
schools
of
elegant
playful
dolphin
swam
alongside
for
entire
days
they
went
in
groups
of
five
or
six
hunting
in
packs
like
wolves
over
the
countryside
moreover
theyre
just
as
voracious
as
dogfish
if
i
can
believe
a
certain
copenhagen
professor
who
says
that
from
one
dolphins
stomach
he
removed
thirteen
porpoises
and
fifteen
seals
true
it
was
a
killer
whale
belonging
to
the
biggest
known
species
whose
length
sometimes
exceeds
twentyfour
feet
the
family
delphinia
numbers
ten
genera
and
the
dolphins
i
saw
were
akin
to
the
genus
delphinorhynchus
remarkable
for
an
extremely
narrow
muzzle
four
times
as
long
as
the
cranium
measuring
three
meters
their
bodies
were
black
on
top
underneath
a
pinkish
white
strewn
with
small
very
scattered
spots
from
these
seas
ill
also
mention
some
unusual
specimens
of
croakers
fish
from
the
order
acanthopterygia
family
scienidea
some
authorsmore
artistic
than
scientificclaim
that
these
fish
are
melodious
singers
that
their
voices
in
unison
put
on
concerts
unmatched
by
human
choristers
i
dont
say
nay
but
to
my
regret
these
croakers
didnt
serenade
us
as
we
passed
finally
to
conclude
conseil
classified
a
large
number
of
flying
fish
nothing
could
have
made
a
more
unusual
sight
than
the
marvelous
timing
with
which
dolphins
hunt
these
fish
whatever
the
range
of
its
flight
however
evasive
its
trajectory
even
up
and
over
the
nautilus
the
hapless
flying
fish
always
found
a
dolphin
to
welcome
it
with
open
mouth
these
were
either
flying
gurnards
or
kitelike
sea
robins
whose
lips
glowed
in
the
dark
at
night
scrawling
fiery
streaks
in
the
air
before
plunging
into
the
murky
waters
like
so
many
shooting
stars
our
navigating
continued
under
these
conditions
until
march
13
that
day
the
nautilus
was
put
to
work
in
some
depthsounding
experiments
that
fascinated
me
deeply
by
then
we
had
fared
nearly
13000
leagues
from
our
starting
point
in
the
pacific
high
seas
our
position
fix
placed
us
in
latitude
45
degrees
37
south
and
longitude
37
degrees
53
west
these
were
the
same
waterways
where
captain
denham
aboard
the
herald
payed
out
14000
meters
of
sounding
line
without
finding
bottom
it
was
here
too
that
lieutenant
parker
aboard
the
american
frigate
congress
was
unable
to
reach
the
underwater
soil
at
15149
meters
captain
nemo
decided
to
take
his
nautilus
down
to
the
lowest
depths
in
order
to
doublecheck
these
different
soundings
i
got
ready
to
record
the
results
of
this
experiment
the
panels
in
the
lounge
opened
and
maneuvers
began
for
reaching
those
strata
so
prodigiously
far
removed
it
was
apparently
considered
out
of
the
question
to
dive
by
filling
the
ballast
tanks
perhaps
they
wouldnt
sufficiently
increase
the
nautiluss
specific
gravity
moreover
in
order
to
come
back
up
it
would
be
necessary
to
expel
the
excess
water
and
our
pumps
might
not
have
been
strong
enough
to
overcome
the
outside
pressure
captain
nemo
decided
to
make
for
the
ocean
floor
by
submerging
on
an
appropriately
gradual
diagonal
with
the
help
of
his
side
fins
which
were
set
at
a
45
degrees
angle
to
the
nautiluss
waterline
then
the
propeller
was
brought
to
its
maximum
speed
and
its
four
blades
churned
the
waves
with
indescribable
violence
under
this
powerful
thrust
the
nautiluss
hull
quivered
like
a
resonating
chord
and
the
ship
sank
steadily
under
the
waters
stationed
in
the
lounge
the
captain
and
i
watched
the
needle
swerving
swiftly
over
the
pressure
gauge
soon
we
had
gone
below
the
livable
zone
where
most
fish
reside
some
of
these
animals
can
thrive
only
at
the
surface
of
seas
or
rivers
but
a
minority
can
dwell
at
fairly
great
depths
among
the
latter
i
observed
a
species
of
dogfish
called
the
cow
shark
thats
equipped
with
six
respiratory
slits
the
telescope
fish
with
its
enormous
eyes
the
armored
gurnard
with
gray
thoracic
fins
plus
black
pectoral
fins
and
a
breastplate
protected
by
pale
red
slabs
of
bone
then
finally
the
grenadier
living
at
a
depth
of
1200
meters
by
that
point
tolerating
a
pressure
of
120
atmospheres
i
asked
captain
nemo
if
he
had
observed
any
fish
at
more
considerable
depths
fish
rarely
he
answered
me
but
given
the
current
state
of
marine
science
who
are
we
to
presume
what
do
we
really
know
of
these
depths
just
this
captain
in
going
toward
the
oceans
lower
strata
we
know
that
vegetable
life
disappears
more
quickly
than
animal
life
we
know
that
moving
creatures
can
still
be
encountered
where
water
plants
no
longer
grow
we
know
that
oysters
and
pilgrim
scallops
live
in
2000
meters
of
water
and
that
admiral
mcclintock
englands
hero
of
the
polar
seas
pulled
in
a
live
sea
star
from
a
depth
of
2500
meters
we
know
that
the
crew
of
the
royal
navys
bulldog
fished
up
a
starfish
from
2620
fathoms
hence
from
a
depth
of
more
than
one
vertical
league
would
you
still
say
captain
nemo
that
we
really
know
nothing
no
professor
the
captain
replied
i
wouldnt
be
so
discourteous
yet
ill
ask
you
to
explain
how
these
creatures
can
live
at
such
depths
i
explain
it
on
two
grounds
i
replied
in
the
first
place
because
vertical
currents
which
are
caused
by
differences
in
the
waters
salinity
and
density
can
produce
enough
motion
to
sustain
the
rudimentary
lifestyles
of
sea
lilies
and
starfish
true
the
captain
put
in
in
the
second
place
because
oxygen
is
the
basis
of
life
and
we
know
that
the
amount
of
oxygen
dissolved
in
salt
water
increases
rather
than
decreases
with
depth
that
the
pressure
in
these
lower
strata
helps
to
concentrate
their
oxygen
content
oho
we
know
that
do
we
captain
nemo
replied
in
a
tone
of
mild
surprise
well
professor
we
have
good
reason
to
know
it
because
its
the
truth
i
might
add
in
fact
that
the
air
bladders
of
fish
contain
more
nitrogen
than
oxygen
when
these
animals
are
caught
at
the
surface
of
the
water
and
conversely
more
oxygen
than
nitrogen
when
theyre
pulled
up
from
the
lower
depths
which
bears
out
your
formulation
but
lets
continue
our
observations
my
eyes
flew
back
to
the
pressure
gauge
the
instrument
indicated
a
depth
of
6000
meters
our
submergence
had
been
going
on
for
an
hour
the
nautilus
slid
downward
on
its
slanting
fins
still
sinking
these
deserted
waters
were
wonderfully
clear
with
a
transparency
impossible
to
convey
an
hour
later
we
were
at
13000
metersabout
three
and
a
quarter
vertical
leaguesand
the
ocean
floor
was
nowhere
in
sight
however
at
14000
meters
i
saw
blackish
peaks
rising
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
but
these
summits
could
have
belonged
to
mountains
as
high
or
even
higher
than
the
himalayas
or
mt
blanc
and
the
extent
of
these
depths
remained
incalculable
despite
the
powerful
pressures
it
was
undergoing
the
nautilus
sank
still
deeper
i
could
feel
its
sheetiron
plates
trembling
down
to
their
riveted
joins
metal
bars
arched
bulkheads
groaned
the
lounge
windows
seemed
to
be
warping
inward
under
the
waters
pressure
and
this
whole
sturdy
mechanism
would
surely
have
given
way
if
as
its
captain
had
said
it
werent
capable
of
resisting
like
a
solid
block
while
grazing
these
rocky
slopes
lost
under
the
waters
i
still
spotted
some
seashells
tube
worms
lively
annelid
worms
from
the
genus
spirorbis
and
certain
starfish
specimens
but
soon
these
last
representatives
of
animal
life
vanished
and
three
vertical
leagues
down
the
nautilus
passed
below
the
limits
of
underwater
existence
just
as
an
air
balloon
rises
above
the
breathable
zones
in
the
sky
we
reached
a
depth
of
16000
metersfour
vertical
leaguesand
by
then
the
nautiluss
plating
was
tolerating
a
pressure
of
1600
atmospheres
in
other
words
1600
kilograms
per
each
square
centimeter
on
its
surface
what
an
experience
i
exclaimed
traveling
these
deep
regions
where
no
man
has
ever
ventured
before
look
captain
look
at
these
magnificent
rocks
these
uninhabited
caves
these
last
global
haunts
where
life
is
no
longer
possible
what
unheardof
scenery
and
why
are
we
reduced
to
preserving
it
only
as
a
memory
would
you
like
captain
nemo
asked
me
to
bring
back
more
than
just
a
memory
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
nothing
could
be
easier
than
taking
a
photograph
of
this
underwater
region
before
i
had
time
to
express
the
surprise
this
new
proposition
caused
me
a
camera
was
carried
into
the
lounge
at
captain
nemos
request
the
liquid
setting
electrically
lit
unfolded
with
perfect
clarity
through
the
wideopen
panels
no
shadows
no
blurs
thanks
to
our
artificial
light
not
even
sunshine
could
have
been
better
for
our
purposes
with
the
thrust
of
its
propeller
curbed
by
the
slant
of
its
fins
the
nautilus
stood
still
the
camera
was
aimed
at
the
scenery
on
the
ocean
floor
and
in
a
few
seconds
we
had
a
perfect
negative
i
attach
a
print
of
the
positive
in
it
you
can
view
these
primordial
rocks
that
have
never
seen
the
light
of
day
this
nether
granite
that
forms
the
powerful
foundation
of
our
globe
the
deep
caves
cut
into
the
stony
mass
the
outlines
of
incomparable
distinctness
whose
far
edges
stand
out
in
black
as
if
from
the
brush
of
certain
flemish
painters
in
the
distance
is
a
mountainous
horizon
a
wondrously
undulating
line
that
makes
up
the
background
of
this
landscape
the
general
effect
of
these
smooth
rocks
is
indescribable
black
polished
without
moss
or
other
blemish
carved
into
strange
shapes
sitting
firmly
on
a
carpet
of
sand
that
sparkled
beneath
our
streams
of
electric
light
meanwhile
his
photographic
operations
over
captain
nemo
told
me
lets
go
back
up
professor
we
mustnt
push
our
luck
and
expose
the
nautilus
too
long
to
these
pressures
lets
go
back
up
i
replied
hold
on
tight
before
i
had
time
to
realize
why
the
captain
made
this
recommendation
i
was
hurled
to
the
carpet
its
fins
set
vertically
its
propeller
thrown
in
gear
at
the
captains
signal
the
nautilus
rose
with
lightning
speed
shooting
upward
like
an
air
balloon
into
the
sky
vibrating
resonantly
it
knifed
through
the
watery
mass
not
a
single
detail
was
visible
in
four
minutes
it
had
cleared
the
four
vertical
leagues
separating
it
from
the
surface
of
the
ocean
and
after
emerging
like
a
flying
fish
it
fell
back
into
the
sea
making
the
waves
leap
to
prodigious
heights

sperm

baleen
whales
during
the
night
of
march
1314
the
nautilus
resumed
its
southward
heading
once
it
was
abreast
of
cape
horn
i
thought
it
would
strike
west
of
the
cape
make
for
pacific
seas
and
complete
its
tour
of
the
world
it
did
nothing
of
the
sort
and
kept
moving
toward
the
southernmost
regions
so
where
was
it
bound
the
pole
that
was
insanity
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
the
captains
recklessness
more
than
justified
ned
lands
worst
fears
for
a
good
while
the
canadian
had
said
nothing
more
to
me
about
his
escape
plans
he
had
become
less
sociable
almost
sullen
i
could
see
how
heavily
this
protracted
imprisonment
was
weighing
on
him
i
could
feel
the
anger
building
in
him
whenever
he
encountered
the
captain
his
eyes
would
flicker
with
dark
fire
and
i
was
in
constant
dread
that
his
natural
vehemence
would
cause
him
to
do
something
rash
that
day
march
14
he
and
conseil
managed
to
find
me
in
my
stateroom
i
asked
them
the
purpose
of
their
visit
to
put
a
simple
question
to
you
sir
the
canadian
answered
me
go
on
ned
how
many
men
do
you
think
are
on
board
the
nautilus
im
unable
to
say
my
friend
it
seems
to
me
ned
land
went
on
that
it
wouldnt
take
much
of
a
crew
to
run
a
ship
like
this
one
correct
i
replied
under
existing
conditions
some
ten
men
at
the
most
should
be
enough
to
operate
it
all
right
the
canadian
said
then
why
should
there
be
any
more
than
that
why
i
answered
i
stared
at
ned
land
whose
motives
were
easy
to
guess
because
i
said
if
i
can
trust
my
hunches
if
i
truly
understand
the
captains
way
of
life
his
nautilus
isnt
simply
a
ship
its
meant
to
be
a
refuge
for
people
like
its
commander
people
who
have
severed
all
ties
with
the
shore
perhaps
conseil
said
but
in
a
nutshell
the
nautilus
can
hold
only
a
certain
number
of
men
so
couldnt
master
estimate
their
maximum
how
conseil
by
calculating
it
master
is
familiar
with
the
ships
capacity
hence
the
amount
of
air
it
contains
on
the
other
hand
master
knows
how
much
air
each
man
consumes
in
the
act
of
breathing
and
he
can
compare
this
data
with
the
fact
that
the
nautilus
must
rise
to
the
surface
every
twentyfour
hours



conseil
didnt
finish
his
sentence
but
i
could
easily
see
what
he
was
driving
at
i
follow
you
i
said
but
while
theyre
simple
to
do
such
calculations
can
give
only
a
very
uncertain
figure
no
problem
the
canadian
went
on
insistently
then
heres
how
to
calculate
it
i
replied
in
one
hour
each
man
consumes
the
oxygen
contained
in
100
liters
of
air
hence
during
twentyfour
hours
the
oxygen
contained
in
2400
liters
therefore
we
must
look
for
the
multiple
of
2400
liters
of
air
that
gives
us
the
amount
found
in
the
nautilus
precisely
conseil
said
now
then
i
went
on
the
nautiluss
capacity
is
1500
metric
tons
and
that
of
a
ton
is
1000
liters
so
the
nautilus
holds
1500000
liters
of
air
which
divided
by
2400



i
did
a
quick
pencil
calculation



gives
us
the
quotient
of
625
which
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
the
air
contained
in
the
nautilus
would
be
exactly
enough
for
625
men
over
twentyfour
hours
625
ned
repeated
but
rest
assured
i
added
that
between
passengers
seamen
or
officers
we
dont
total
onetenth
of
that
figure
which
is
still
too
many
for
three
men
conseil
muttered
so
my
poor
ned
i
can
only
counsel
patience
and
conseil
replied
even
more
than
patience
resignation
conseil
had
said
the
true
word
even
so
he
went
on
captain
nemo
cant
go
south
forever
hell
surely
have
to
stop
if
only
at
the
ice
bank
and
hell
return
to
the
seas
of
civilization
then
it
will
be
time
to
resume
ned
lands
plans
the
canadian
shook
his
head
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
made
no
reply
and
left
us
with
masters
permission
ill
make
an
observation
to
him
conseil
then
told
me
our
poor
ned
broods
about
all
the
things
he
cant
have
hes
haunted
by
his
former
life
he
seems
to
miss
everything
thats
denied
us
hes
obsessed
by
his
old
memories
and
its
breaking
his
heart
we
must
understand
him
what
does
he
have
to
occupy
him
here
nothing
he
isnt
a
scientist
like
master
and
he
doesnt
share
our
enthusiasm
for
the
seas
wonders
he
would
risk
anything
just
to
enter
a
tavern
in
his
own
country
to
be
sure
the
monotony
of
life
on
board
must
have
seemed
unbearable
to
the
canadian
who
was
accustomed
to
freedom
and
activity
it
was
a
rare
event
that
could
excite
him
that
day
however
a
development
occurred
that
reminded
him
of
his
happy
years
as
a
harpooner
near
eleven
oclock
in
the
morning
while
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
nautilus
fell
in
with
a
herd
of
baleen
whales
this
encounter
didnt
surprise
me
because
i
knew
these
animals
were
being
hunted
so
relentlessly
that
they
took
refuge
in
the
ocean
basins
of
the
high
latitudes
in
the
maritime
world
and
in
the
realm
of
geographic
exploration
whales
have
played
a
major
role
this
is
the
animal
that
first
dragged
the
basques
in
its
wake
then
asturian
spaniards
englishmen
and
dutchmen
emboldening
them
against
the
oceans
perils
and
leading
them
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
baleen
whales
like
to
frequent
the
southernmost
and
northernmost
seas
old
legends
even
claim
that
these
cetaceans
led
fishermen
to
within
a
mere
seven
leagues
of
the
north
pole
although
this
feat
is
fictitious
it
will
someday
come
true
because
its
likely
that
by
hunting
whales
in
the
arctic
or
antarctic
regions
man
will
finally
reach
this
unknown
spot
on
the
globe
we
were
seated
on
the
platform
next
to
a
tranquil
sea
the
month
of
march
since
its
the
equivalent
of
october
in
these
latitudes
was
giving
us
some
fine
autumn
days
it
was
the
canadianon
this
topic
he
was
never
mistakenwho
sighted
a
baleen
whale
on
the
eastern
horizon
if
you
looked
carefully
you
could
see
its
blackish
back
alternately
rise
and
fall
above
the
waves
five
miles
from
the
nautilus
wow
ned
land
exclaimed
if
i
were
on
board
a
whaler
theres
an
encounter
that
would
be
great
fun
thats
one
big
animal
look
how
high
its
blowholes
are
spouting
all
that
air
and
steam
damnation
why
am
i
chained
to
this
hunk
of
sheet
iron
why
ned
i
replied
you
still
arent
over
your
old
fishing
urges
how
could
a
whale
fisherman
forget
his
old
trade
sir
who
could
ever
get
tired
of
such
exciting
hunting
youve
never
fished
these
seas
ned
never
sir
just
the
northernmost
seas
equally
in
the
bering
strait
and
the
davis
strait
so
the
southern
right
whale
is
still
unknown
to
you
until
now
its
the
bowhead
whale
youve
hunted
and
it
wont
risk
going
past
the
warm
waters
of
the
equator
oh
professor
what
are
you
feeding
me
the
canadian
answered
in
a
tolerably
skeptical
tone
im
feeding
you
the
facts
by
thunder
in
65
just
two
and
a
half
years
ago
i
to
whom
you
speak
i
myself
stepped
onto
the
carcass
of
a
whale
near
greenland
and
its
flank
still
carried
the
marked
harpoon
of
a
whaling
ship
from
the
bering
sea
now
i
ask
you
after
it
had
been
wounded
west
of
america
how
could
this
animal
be
killed
in
the
east
unless
it
had
cleared
the
equator
and
doubled
cape
horn
or
the
cape
of
good
hope
i
agree
with
our
friend
ned
conseil
said
and
im
waiting
to
hear
how
master
will
reply
to
him
master
will
reply
my
friends
that
baleen
whales
are
localized
according
to
species
within
certain
seas
that
they
never
leave
and
if
one
of
these
animals
went
from
the
bering
strait
to
the
davis
strait
its
quite
simply
because
theres
some
passageway
from
the
one
sea
to
the
other
either
along
the
coasts
of
canada
or
siberia
you
expect
us
to
fall
for
that
the
canadian
asked
tipping
me
a
wink
if
master
says
so
conseil
replied
which
means
the
canadian
went
on
since
ive
never
fished
these
waterways
i
dont
know
the
whales
that
frequent
them
thats
what
ive
been
telling
you
ned
all
the
more
reason
to
get
to
know
them
conseil
answered
look
look
the
canadian
exclaimed
his
voice
full
of
excitement
its
approaching
its
coming
toward
us
its
thumbing
its
nose
at
me
it
knows
i
cant
do
a
blessed
thing
to
it
ned
stamped
his
foot
brandishing
an
imaginary
harpoon
his
hands
positively
trembled
these
cetaceans
he
asked
are
they
as
big
as
the
ones
in
the
northernmost
seas
pretty
nearly
ned
because
ive
seen
big
baleen
whales
sir
whales
measuring
up
to
100
feet
long
ive
even
heard
that
those
rorqual
whales
off
the
aleutian
islands
sometimes
get
over
150
feet
that
strikes
me
as
exaggerated
i
replied
those
animals
are
only
members
of
the
genus
balaenoptera
furnished
with
dorsal
fins
and
like
sperm
whales
theyre
generally
smaller
than
the
bowhead
whale
oh
exclaimed
the
canadian
whose
eyes
hadnt
left
the
ocean
its
getting
closer
its
coming
into
the
nautiluss
waters
then
going
on
with
his
conversation
you
talk
about
sperm
whales
he
said
as
if
they
were
little
beasts
but
there
are
stories
of
gigantic
sperm
whales
theyre
shrewd
cetaceans
i
hear
that
some
will
cover
themselves
with
algae
and
fucus
plants
people
mistake
them
for
islets
they
pitch
camp
on
top
make
themselves
at
home
light
a
fire
build
houses
conseil
said
yes
funny
man
ned
land
replied
then
one
fine
day
the
animal
dives
and
drags
all
its
occupants
down
into
the
depths
like
in
the
voyages
of
sinbad
the
sailor
i
answered
laughing
oh
mr
land
youre
addicted
to
tall
tales
what
sperm
whales
youre
handing
us
i
hope
you
dont
really
believe
in
them
mr
naturalist
the
canadian
replied
in
all
seriousness
when
it
comes
to
whales
you
can
believe
anything
look
at
that
one
move
look
at
it
stealing
away
people
claim
these
animals
can
circle
around
the
world
in
just
fifteen
days
i
dont
say
nay
but
what
you
undoubtedly
dont
know
professor
aronnax
is
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
world
whales
traveled
even
quicker
oh
really
ned
and
why
so
because
in
those
days
their
tails
moved
side
to
side
like
those
on
fish
in
other
words
their
tails
were
straight
up
thrashing
the
water
from
left
to
right
right
to
left
but
spotting
that
they
swam
too
fast
our
creator
twisted
their
tails
and
ever
since
theyve
been
thrashing
the
waves
up
and
down
at
the
expense
of
their
speed
fine
ned
i
said
then
resurrected
one
of
the
canadians
expressions
you
expect
us
to
fall
for
that
not
too
terribly
ned
land
replied
and
no
more
than
if
i
told
you
there
are
whales
that
are
300
feet
long
and
weigh
1000000
pounds
thats
indeed
considerable
i
said
but
you
must
admit
that
certain
cetaceans
do
grow
to
significant
size
since
theyre
said
to
supply
as
much
as
120
metric
tons
of
oil
that
ive
seen
the
canadian
said
i
can
easily
believe
it
ned
just
as
i
can
believe
that
certain
baleen
whales
equal
100
elephants
in
bulk
imagine
the
impact
of
such
a
mass
if
it
were
launched
at
full
speed
is
it
true
conseil
asked
that
they
can
sink
ships
ships
i
doubt
it
i
replied
however
they
say
that
in
1820
right
in
these
southern
seas
a
baleen
whale
rushed
at
the
essex
and
pushed
it
backward
at
a
speed
of
four
meters
per
second
its
stern
was
flooded
and
the
essex
went
down
fast
ned
looked
at
me
with
a
bantering
expression
speaking
for
myself
he
said
i
once
got
walloped
by
a
whales
tailin
my
longboat
needless
to
say
my
companions
and
i
were
launched
to
an
altitude
of
six
meters
but
next
to
the
professors
whale
mine
was
just
a
baby
do
these
animals
live
a
long
time
conseil
asked
a
thousand
years
the
canadian
replied
without
hesitation
and
how
ned
i
asked
do
you
know
thats
so
because
people
say
so
and
why
do
people
say
so
because
people
know
so
no
ned
people
dont
know
so
they
suppose
so
and
heres
the
logic
with
which
they
back
up
their
beliefs
when
fishermen
first
hunted
whales
400
years
ago
these
animals
grew
to
bigger
sizes
than
they
do
today
reasonably
enough
its
assumed
that
todays
whales
are
smaller
because
they
havent
had
time
to
reach
their
full
growth
thats
why
the
count
de
buffons
encyclopedia
says
that
cetaceans
can
live
and
even
must
live
for
a
thousand
years
you
understand
ned
land
didnt
understand
he
no
longer
even
heard
me
that
baleen
whale
kept
coming
closer
his
eyes
devoured
it
oh
he
exclaimed
its
not
just
one
whale
its
ten
twenty
a
whole
gam
and
i
cant
do
a
thing
im
tied
hand
and
foot
but
ned
my
friend
conseil
said
why
not
ask
captain
nemo
for
permission
to
hunt
before
conseil
could
finish
his
sentence
ned
land
scooted
down
the
hatch
and
ran
to
look
for
the
captain
a
few
moments
later
the
two
of
them
reappeared
on
the
platform
captain
nemo
observed
the
herd
of
cetaceans
cavorting
on
the
waters
a
mile
from
the
nautilus
theyre
southern
right
whales
he
said
there
goes
the
fortune
of
a
whole
whaling
fleet
well
sir
the
canadian
asked
couldnt
i
hunt
them
just
so
i
dont
forget
my
old
harpooning
trade
hunt
them
what
for
captain
nemo
replied
simply
to
destroy
them
we
have
no
use
for
whale
oil
on
this
ship
but
sir
the
canadian
went
on
in
the
red
sea
you
authorized
us
to
chase
a
dugong
there
it
was
an
issue
of
obtaining
fresh
meat
for
my
crew
here
it
would
be
killing
for
the
sake
of
killing
im
well
aware
thats
a
privilege
reserved
for
mankind
but
i
dont
allow
such
murderous
pastimes
when
your
peers
mr
land
destroy
decent
harmless
creatures
like
the
southern
right
whale
or
the
bowhead
whale
they
commit
a
reprehensible
offense
thus
theyve
already
depopulated
all
of
baffin
bay
and
theyll
wipe
out
a
whole
class
of
useful
animals
so
leave
these
poor
cetaceans
alone
they
have
quite
enough
natural
enemies
such
as
sperm
whales
swordfish
and
sawfish
without
you
meddling
with
them
ill
let
the
reader
decide
what
faces
the
canadian
made
during
this
lecture
on
hunting
ethics
furnishing
such
arguments
to
a
professional
harpooner
was
a
waste
of
words
ned
land
stared
at
captain
nemo
and
obviously
missed
his
meaning
but
the
captain
was
right
thanks
to
the
mindless
barbaric
bloodthirstiness
of
fishermen
the
last
baleen
whale
will
someday
disappear
from
the
ocean
ned
land
whistled
yankee
doodle
between
his
teeth
stuffed
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
turned
his
back
on
us
meanwhile
captain
nemo
studied
the
herd
of
cetaceans
then
addressed
me
i
was
right
to
claim
that
baleen
whales
have
enough
natural
enemies
without
counting
man
these
specimens
will
soon
have
to
deal
with
mighty
opponents
eight
miles
to
leeward
professor
aronnax
can
you
see
those
blackish
specks
moving
about
yes
captain
i
replied
those
are
sperm
whales
dreadful
animals
that
ive
sometimes
encountered
in
herds
of
200
or
300
as
for
them
theyre
cruel
destructive
beasts
and
they
deserve
to
be
exterminated
the
canadian
turned
swiftly
at
these
last
words
well
captain
i
said
on
behalf
of
the
baleen
whales
theres
still
time
its
pointless
to
run
any
risks
professor
the
nautilus
will
suffice
to
disperse
these
sperm
whales
its
armed
with
a
steel
spur
quite
equal
to
mr
lands
harpoon
i
imagine
the
canadian
didnt
even
bother
shrugging
his
shoulders
attacking
cetaceans
with
thrusts
from
a
spur
who
ever
heard
of
such
malarkey
wait
and
see
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
said
well
show
you
a
style
of
hunting
with
which
you
arent
yet
familiar
well
take
no
pity
on
these
ferocious
cetaceans
theyre
merely
mouth
and
teeth
mouth
and
teeth
theres
no
better
way
to
describe
the
longskulled
sperm
whale
whose
length
sometimes
exceeds
twentyfive
meters
the
enormous
head
of
this
cetacean
occupies
about
a
third
of
its
body
better
armed
than
a
baleen
whale
whose
upper
jaw
is
adorned
solely
with
whalebone
the
sperm
whale
is
equipped
with
twentyfive
huge
teeth
that
are
twenty
centimeters
high
have
cylindrical
conical
summits
and
weigh
two
pounds
each
in
the
top
part
of
this
enormous
head
inside
big
cavities
separated
by
cartilage
youll
find
300
to
400
kilograms
of
that
valuable
oil
called
spermaceti
the
sperm
whale
is
an
awkward
animal
more
tadpole
than
fish
as
professor
frdol
has
noted
its
poorly
constructed
being
defective
so
to
speak
over
the
whole
left
side
of
its
frame
with
good
eyesight
only
in
its
right
eye
meanwhile
that
monstrous
herd
kept
coming
closer
it
had
seen
the
baleen
whales
and
was
preparing
to
attack
you
could
tell
in
advance
that
the
sperm
whales
would
be
victorious
not
only
because
they
were
better
built
for
fighting
than
their
harmless
adversaries
but
also
because
they
could
stay
longer
underwater
before
returning
to
breathe
at
the
surface
there
was
just
time
to
run
to
the
rescue
of
the
baleen
whales
the
nautilus
proceeded
to
midwater
conseil
ned
and
i
sat
in
front
of
the
lounge
windows
captain
nemo
made
his
way
to
the
helmsmans
side
to
operate
his
submersible
as
an
engine
of
destruction
soon
i
felt
the
beats
of
our
propeller
getting
faster
and
we
picked
up
speed
the
battle
between
sperm
whales
and
baleen
whales
had
already
begun
when
the
nautilus
arrived
it
maneuvered
to
cut
into
the
herd
of
longskulled
predators
at
first
the
latter
showed
little
concern
at
the
sight
of
this
new
monster
meddling
in
the
battle
but
they
soon
had
to
sidestep
its
thrusts
what
a
struggle
ned
land
quickly
grew
enthusiastic
and
even
ended
up
applauding
brandished
in
its
captains
hands
the
nautilus
was
simply
a
fearsome
harpoon
he
hurled
it
at
those
fleshy
masses
and
ran
them
clean
through
leaving
behind
two
squirming
animal
halves
as
for
those
daunting
strokes
of
the
tail
hitting
our
sides
the
ship
never
felt
them
no
more
than
the
collisions
it
caused
one
sperm
whale
exterminated
it
ran
at
another
tacked
on
the
spot
so
as
not
to
miss
its
prey
went
ahead
or
astern
obeyed
its
rudder
dived
when
the
cetacean
sank
to
deeper
strata
rose
with
it
when
it
returned
to
the
surface
struck
it
headon
or
slantwise
hacked
at
it
or
tore
it
and
from
every
direction
and
at
any
speed
skewered
it
with
its
dreadful
spur
what
bloodshed
what
a
hubbub
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
what
sharp
hisses
and
snorts
unique
to
these
frightened
animals
their
tails
churned
the
normally
peaceful
strata
into
actual
billows
this
homeric
slaughter
dragged
on
for
an
hour
and
the
longskulled
predators
couldnt
get
away
several
times
ten
or
twelve
of
them
teamed
up
trying
to
crush
the
nautilus
with
their
sheer
mass
through
the
windows
you
could
see
their
enormous
mouths
paved
with
teeth
their
fearsome
eyes
losing
all
selfcontrol
ned
land
hurled
threats
and
insults
at
them
you
could
feel
them
clinging
to
the
submersible
like
hounds
atop
a
wild
boar
in
the
underbrush
but
by
forcing
the
pace
of
its
propeller
the
nautilus
carried
them
off
dragged
them
under
or
brought
them
back
to
the
upper
level
of
the
waters
untroubled
by
their
enormous
weight
or
their
powerful
grip
finally
this
mass
of
sperm
whales
thinned
out
the
waves
grew
tranquil
again
i
felt
us
rising
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
hatch
opened
and
we
rushed
onto
the
platform
the
sea
was
covered
with
mutilated
corpses
a
fearsome
explosion
couldnt
have
slashed
torn
or
shredded
these
fleshy
masses
with
greater
violence
we
were
floating
in
the
midst
of
gigantic
bodies
bluish
on
the
back
whitish
on
the
belly
and
all
deformed
by
enormous
protuberances
a
few
frightened
sperm
whales
were
fleeing
toward
the
horizon
the
waves
were
dyed
red
over
an
area
of
several
miles
and
the
nautilus
was
floating
in
the
middle
of
a
sea
of
blood
captain
nemo
rejoined
us
well
mr
land
he
said
well
sir
replied
the
canadian
whose
enthusiasm
had
subsided
its
a
dreadful
sight
for
sure
but
im
a
hunter
not
a
butcher
and
this
is
plain
butchery
it
was
a
slaughter
of
destructive
animals
the
captain
replied
and
the
nautilus
is
no
butcher
knife
i
prefer
my
harpoon
the
canadian
answered
to
each
his
own
the
captain
replied
staring
intently
at
ned
land
i
was
in
dread
the
latter
would
give
way
to
some
violent
outburst
that
might
have
had
deplorable
consequences
but
his
anger
was
diverted
by
the
sight
of
a
baleen
whale
that
the
nautilus
had
pulled
alongside
of
just
then
this
animal
had
been
unable
to
escape
the
teeth
of
those
sperm
whales
i
recognized
the
southern
right
whale
its
head
squat
its
body
dark
all
over
anatomically
its
distinguished
from
the
white
whale
and
the
black
right
whale
by
the
fusion
of
its
seven
cervical
vertebrae
and
it
numbers
two
more
ribs
than
its
relatives
floating
on
its
side
its
belly
riddled
with
bites
the
poor
cetacean
was
dead
still
hanging
from
the
tip
of
its
mutilated
fin
was
a
little
baby
whale
that
it
had
been
unable
to
rescue
from
the
slaughter
its
open
mouth
let
water
flow
through
its
whalebone
like
a
murmuring
surf
captain
nemo
guided
the
nautilus
next
to
the
animals
corpse
two
of
his
men
climbed
onto
the
whales
flank
and
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
them
draw
from
its
udders
all
the
milk
they
held
in
other
words
enough
to
fill
two
or
three
casks
the
captain
offered
me
a
cup
of
this
stillwarm
milk
i
couldnt
help
showing
my
distaste
for
such
a
beverage
he
assured
me
that
this
milk
was
excellent
no
different
from
cows
milk
i
sampled
it
and
agreed
so
this
milk
was
a
worthwhile
reserve
ration
for
us
because
in
the
form
of
salt
butter
or
cheese
it
would
provide
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
from
our
standard
fare
from
that
day
on
i
noted
with
some
uneasiness
that
ned
lands
attitudes
toward
captain
nemo
grew
worse
and
worse
and
i
decided
to
keep
a
close
watch
on
the
canadians
movements
and
activities

the
nautilus
resumed
its
unruffled
southbound
heading
it
went
along
the
50th
meridian
with
considerable
speed
would
it
go
to
the
pole
i
didnt
think
so
because
every
previous
attempt
to
reach
this
spot
on
the
globe
had
failed
besides
the
season
was
already
quite
advanced
since
march
13
on
antarctic
shores
corresponds
with
september
13
in
the
northernmost
regions
which
marks
the
beginning
of
the
equinoctial
period
on
march
14
at
latitude
55
degrees
i
spotted
floating
ice
plain
pale
bits
of
rubble
twenty
to
twentyfive
feet
long
which
formed
reefs
over
which
the
sea
burst
into
foam
the
nautilus
stayed
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
having
fished
in
the
arctic
seas
ned
land
was
already
familiar
with
the
sight
of
icebergs
conseil
and
i
were
marveling
at
them
for
the
first
time
in
the
sky
toward
the
southern
horizon
there
stretched
a
dazzling
white
band
english
whalers
have
given
this
the
name
ice
blink
no
matter
how
heavy
the
clouds
may
be
they
cant
obscure
this
phenomenon
it
announces
the
presence
of
a
pack
or
shoal
of
ice
indeed
larger
blocks
of
ice
soon
appeared
their
brilliance
varying
at
the
whim
of
the
mists
some
of
these
masses
displayed
green
veins
as
if
scrawled
with
undulating
lines
of
copper
sulfate
others
looked
like
enormous
amethysts
letting
the
light
penetrate
their
insides
the
latter
reflected
the
suns
rays
from
the
thousand
facets
of
their
crystals
the
former
tinted
with
a
bright
limestone
sheen
would
have
supplied
enough
building
material
to
make
a
whole
marble
town
the
farther
down
south
we
went
the
more
these
floating
islands
grew
in
numbers
and
prominence
polar
birds
nested
on
them
by
the
thousands
these
were
petrels
cape
pigeons
or
puffins
and
their
calls
were
deafening
mistaking
the
nautilus
for
the
corpse
of
a
whale
some
of
them
alighted
on
it
and
prodded
its
resonant
sheet
iron
with
pecks
of
their
beaks
during
this
navigating
in
the
midst
of
the
ice
captain
nemo
often
stayed
on
the
platform
he
observed
these
deserted
waterways
carefully
i
saw
his
calm
eyes
sometimes
perk
up
in
these
polar
seas
forbidden
to
man
did
he
feel
right
at
home
the
lord
of
these
unreachable
regions
perhaps
but
he
didnt
say
he
stood
still
reviving
only
when
his
pilots
instincts
took
over
then
steering
his
nautilus
with
consummate
dexterity
he
skillfully
dodged
the
masses
of
ice
some
of
which
measured
several
miles
in
length
their
heights
varying
from
seventy
to
eighty
meters
often
the
horizon
seemed
completely
closed
off
abreast
of
latitude
60
degrees
every
passageway
had
disappeared
searching
with
care
captain
nemo
soon
found
a
narrow
opening
into
which
he
brazenly
slipped
well
aware
however
that
it
would
close
behind
him
guided
by
his
skillful
hands
the
nautilus
passed
by
all
these
different
masses
of
ice
which
are
classified
by
size
and
shape
with
a
precision
that
enraptured
conseil
icebergs
or
mountains
ice
fields
or
smooth
limitless
tracts
drift
ice
or
floating
floes
packs
or
broken
tracts
called
patches
when
theyre
circular
and
streams
when
they
form
long
strips
the
temperature
was
fairly
low
exposed
to
the
outside
air
the
thermometer
marked
2
degrees
to
3
degrees
centigrade
but
we
were
warmly
dressed
in
furs
for
which
seals
and
aquatic
bears
had
paid
the
price
evenly
heated
by
all
its
electric
equipment
the
nautiluss
interior
defied
the
most
intense
cold
moreover
to
find
a
bearable
temperature
the
ship
had
only
to
sink
just
a
few
meters
beneath
the
waves
two
months
earlier
we
would
have
enjoyed
perpetual
daylight
in
this
latitude
but
night
already
fell
for
three
or
four
hours
and
later
it
would
cast
six
months
of
shadow
over
these
circumpolar
regions
on
march
15
we
passed
beyond
the
latitude
of
the
south
shetland
and
south
orkney
islands
the
captain
told
me
that
many
tribes
of
seals
used
to
inhabit
these
shores
but
english
and
american
whalers
in
a
frenzy
of
destruction
slaughtered
all
the
adults
including
pregnant
females
and
where
life
and
activity
once
existed
those
fishermen
left
behind
only
silence
and
death
going
along
the
55th
meridian
the
nautilus
cut
the
antarctic
circle
on
march
16
near
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
ice
completely
surrounded
us
and
closed
off
the
horizon
nevertheless
captain
nemo
went
from
passageway
to
passageway
always
proceeding
south
but
wheres
he
going
i
asked
straight
ahead
conseil
replied
ultimately
when
he
cant
go
any
farther
hell
stop
i
wouldnt
bet
on
it
i
replied
and
in
all
honesty
i
confess
that
this
venturesome
excursion
was
far
from
displeasing
to
me
i
cant
express
the
intensity
of
my
amazement
at
the
beauties
of
these
new
regions
the
ice
struck
superb
poses
here
its
general
effect
suggested
an
oriental
town
with
countless
minarets
and
mosques
there
a
city
in
ruins
flung
to
the
ground
by
convulsions
in
the
earth
these
views
were
varied
continuously
by
the
suns
oblique
rays
or
were
completely
swallowed
up
by
gray
mists
in
the
middle
of
blizzards
then
explosions
caveins
and
great
iceberg
somersaults
would
occur
all
around
us
altering
the
scenery
like
the
changing
landscape
in
a
diorama
if
the
nautilus
was
submerged
during
these
losses
of
balance
we
heard
the
resulting
noises
spread
under
the
waters
with
frightful
intensity
and
the
collapse
of
these
masses
created
daunting
eddies
down
to
the
oceans
lower
strata
the
nautilus
then
rolled
and
pitched
like
a
ship
left
to
the
fury
of
the
elements
often
no
longer
seeing
any
way
out
i
thought
we
were
imprisoned
for
good
but
captain
nemo
guided
by
his
instincts
discovered
new
passageways
from
the
tiniest
indications
he
was
never
wrong
when
he
observed
slender
threads
of
bluish
water
streaking
through
these
ice
fields
accordingly
i
was
sure
that
he
had
already
risked
his
nautilus
in
the
midst
of
the
antarctic
seas
however
during
the
day
of
march
16
these
tracts
of
ice
completely
barred
our
path
it
wasnt
the
ice
bank
as
yet
just
huge
ice
fields
cemented
together
by
the
cold
this
obstacle
couldnt
stop
captain
nemo
and
he
launched
his
ship
against
the
ice
fields
with
hideous
violence
the
nautilus
went
into
these
brittle
masses
like
a
wedge
splitting
them
with
dreadful
cracklings
it
was
an
oldfashioned
battering
ram
propelled
with
infinite
power
hurled
aloft
ice
rubble
fell
back
around
us
like
hail
through
brute
force
alone
the
submersible
carved
out
a
channel
for
itself
carried
away
by
its
momentum
the
ship
sometimes
mounted
on
top
of
these
tracts
of
ice
and
crushed
them
with
its
weight
or
at
other
times
when
cooped
up
beneath
the
ice
fields
it
split
them
with
simple
pitching
movements
creating
wide
punctures
violent
squalls
assaulted
us
during
the
daytime
thanks
to
certain
heavy
mists
we
couldnt
see
from
one
end
of
the
platform
to
the
other
the
wind
shifted
abruptly
to
every
point
on
the
compass
the
snow
was
piling
up
in
such
packed
layers
it
had
to
be
chipped
loose
with
blows
from
picks
even
in
a
temperature
of
merely
5
degrees
centigrade
every
outside
part
of
the
nautilus
was
covered
with
ice
a
ships
rigging
would
have
been
unusable
because
all
its
tackle
would
have
jammed
in
the
grooves
of
the
pulleys
only
a
craft
without
sails
driven
by
an
electric
motor
that
needed
no
coal
could
face
such
high
latitudes
under
these
conditions
the
barometer
generally
stayed
quite
low
it
fell
as
far
as
735
centimeters
our
compass
indications
no
longer
offered
any
guarantees
the
deranged
needles
would
mark
contradictory
directions
as
we
approached
the
southern
magnetic
pole
which
doesnt
coincide
with
the
south
pole
proper
in
fact
according
to
the
astronomer
hansteen
this
magnetic
pole
is
located
fairly
close
to
latitude
70
degrees
and
longitude
130
degrees
or
abiding
by
the
observations
of
louisisidore
duperrey
in
longitude
135
degrees
and
latitude
70
degrees
30
hence
we
had
to
transport
compasses
to
different
parts
of
the
ship
take
many
readings
and
strike
an
average
often
we
could
chart
our
course
only
by
guesswork
a
less
than
satisfactory
method
in
the
midst
of
these
winding
passageways
whose
landmarks
change
continuously
at
last
on
march
18
after
twenty
futile
assaults
the
nautilus
was
decisively
held
in
check
no
longer
was
it
an
ice
stream
patch
or
fieldit
was
an
endless
immovable
barrier
formed
by
ice
mountains
fused
to
each
other
the
ice
bank
the
canadian
told
me
for
ned
land
as
well
as
for
every
navigator
before
us
i
knew
that
this
was
the
great
insurmountable
obstacle
when
the
sun
appeared
for
an
instant
near
noon
captain
nemo
took
a
reasonably
accurate
sight
that
gave
our
position
as
longitude
51
degrees
30
and
latitude
67
degrees
39
south
this
was
a
position
already
well
along
in
these
antarctic
regions
as
for
the
liquid
surface
of
the
sea
there
was
no
longer
any
semblance
of
it
before
our
eyes
before
the
nautiluss
spur
there
lay
vast
broken
plains
a
tangle
of
confused
chunks
with
all
the
helterskelter
unpredictability
typical
of
a
rivers
surface
a
short
while
before
its
ice
breakup
but
in
this
case
the
proportions
were
gigantic
here
and
there
stood
sharp
peaks
lean
spires
that
rose
as
high
as
200
feet
farther
off
a
succession
of
steeply
cut
cliffs
sporting
a
grayish
tint
huge
mirrors
that
reflected
the
sparse
rays
of
a
sun
half
drowned
in
mist
beyond
a
stark
silence
reigned
in
this
desolate
natural
setting
a
silence
barely
broken
by
the
flapping
wings
of
petrels
or
puffins
by
this
point
everything
was
frozen
even
sound
so
the
nautilus
had
to
halt
in
its
venturesome
course
among
these
tracts
of
ice
sir
ned
land
told
me
that
day
if
your
captain
goes
any
farther



yes
hell
be
a
superman
how
so
ned
because
nobody
can
clear
the
ice
bank
your
captains
a
powerful
man
but
damnation
he
isnt
more
powerful
than
nature
if
she
draws
a
boundary
line
there
you
stop
like
it
or
not
correct
ned
land
but
i
still
want
to
know
whats
behind
this
ice
bank
behold
my
greatest
source
of
irritationa
wall
master
is
right
conseil
said
walls
were
invented
simply
to
frustrate
scientists
all
walls
should
be
banned
fine
the
canadian
put
in
but
we
already
know
whats
behind
this
ice
bank
what
i
asked
ice
ice
and
more
ice
you
may
be
sure
of
that
ned
i
answered
but
im
not
thats
why
i
want
to
see
for
myself
well
professor
the
canadian
replied
you
can
just
drop
that
idea
youve
made
it
to
the
ice
bank
which
is
already
far
enough
but
you
wont
get
any
farther
neither
your
captain
nemo
or
his
nautilus
and
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
well
head
north
again
in
other
words
to
the
land
of
sensible
people
i
had
to
agree
that
ned
land
was
right
and
until
ships
are
built
to
navigate
over
tracts
of
ice
theyll
have
to
stop
at
the
ice
bank
indeed
despite
its
efforts
despite
the
powerful
methods
it
used
to
split
this
ice
the
nautilus
was
reduced
to
immobility
ordinarily
when
someone
cant
go
any
farther
he
still
has
the
option
of
returning
in
his
tracks
but
here
it
was
just
as
impossible
to
turn
back
as
to
go
forward
because
every
passageway
had
closed
behind
us
and
if
our
submersible
remained
even
slightly
stationary
it
would
be
frozen
in
without
delay
which
is
exactly
what
happened
near
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
and
fresh
ice
kept
forming
over
the
ships
sides
with
astonishing
speed
i
had
to
admit
that
captain
nemos
leadership
had
been
most
injudicious
just
then
i
was
on
the
platform
observing
the
situation
for
some
while
the
captain
said
to
me
well
professor
what
think
you
i
think
were
trapped
captain
trapped
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
we
cant
go
forward
backward
or
sideways
i
think
thats
the
standard
definition
of
trapped
at
least
in
the
civilized
world
so
professor
aronnax
you
think
the
nautilus
wont
be
able
to
float
clear
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
captain
since
the
season
is
already
too
advanced
for
you
to
depend
on
an
ice
breakup
oh
professor
captain
nemo
replied
in
an
ironic
tone
you
never
change
you
see
only
impediments
and
obstacles
i
promise
you
not
only
will
the
nautilus
float
clear
it
will
go
farther
still
farther
south
i
asked
gaping
at
the
captain
yes
sir
it
will
go
to
the
pole
to
the
pole
i
exclaimed
unable
to
keep
back
a
movement
of
disbelief
yes
the
captain
replied
coolly
the
antarctic
pole
that
unknown
spot
crossed
by
every
meridian
on
the
globe
as
you
know
i
do
whatever
i
like
with
my
nautilus
yes
i
did
know
that
i
knew
this
man
was
daring
to
the
point
of
being
foolhardy
but
to
overcome
all
the
obstacles
around
the
south
poleeven
more
unattainable
than
the
north
pole
which
still
hadnt
been
reached
by
the
boldest
navigatorswasnt
this
an
absolutely
insane
undertaking
one
that
could
occur
only
in
the
brain
of
a
madman
it
then
dawned
on
me
to
ask
captain
nemo
if
he
had
already
discovered
this
pole
which
no
human
being
had
ever
trod
underfoot
no
sir
he
answered
me
but
well
discover
it
together
where
others
have
failed
ill
succeed
never
before
has
my
nautilus
cruised
so
far
into
these
southernmost
seas
but
i
repeat
it
will
go
farther
still
id
like
to
believe
you
captain
i
went
on
in
a
tone
of
some
sarcasm
oh
i
do
believe
you
lets
forge
ahead
there
are
no
obstacles
for
us
lets
shatter
this
ice
bank
lets
blow
it
up
and
if
it
still
resists
lets
put
wings
on
the
nautilus
and
fly
over
it
over
it
professor
captain
nemo
replied
serenely
no
not
over
it
but
under
it
under
it
i
exclaimed
a
sudden
insight
into
captain
nemos
plans
had
just
flashed
through
my
mind
i
understood
the
marvelous
talents
of
his
nautilus
would
be
put
to
work
once
again
in
this
superhuman
undertaking
i
can
see
were
starting
to
understand
each
other
professor
captain
nemo
told
me
with
a
half
smile
you
already
glimpse
the
potentialmyself
id
say
the
successof
this
attempt
maneuvers
that
arent
feasible
for
an
ordinary
ship
are
easy
for
the
nautilus
if
a
continent
emerges
at
the
pole
well
stop
at
that
continent
but
on
the
other
hand
if
open
sea
washes
the
pole
well
go
to
that
very
place
right
i
said
carried
away
by
the
captains
logic
even
though
the
surface
of
the
sea
has
solidified
into
ice
its
lower
strata
are
still
open
thanks
to
that
divine
justice
that
puts
the
maximum
density
of
salt
water
one
degree
above
its
freezing
point
and
if
im
not
mistaken
the
submerged
part
of
this
ice
bank
is
in
a
fourtoone
ratio
to
its
emerging
part
very
nearly
professor
for
each
foot
of
iceberg
above
the
sea
there
are
three
more
below
now
then
since
these
ice
mountains
dont
exceed
a
height
of
100
meters
they
sink
only
to
a
depth
of
300
meters
and
what
are
300
meters
to
the
nautilus
a
mere
nothing
sir
we
could
even
go
to
greater
depths
and
find
that
temperature
layer
common
to
all
ocean
water
and
there
wed
brave
with
impunity
the
30
degrees
or
40
degrees
cold
on
the
surface
true
sir
very
true
i
replied
with
growing
excitement
our
sole
difficulty
captain
nemo
went
on
lies
in
our
staying
submerged
for
several
days
without
renewing
our
air
supply
thats
all
i
answered
the
nautilus
has
huge
air
tanks
well
fill
them
up
and
theyll
supply
all
the
oxygen
we
need
good
thinking
professor
aronnax
the
captain
replied
with
a
smile
but
since
i
dont
want
to
be
accused
of
foolhardiness
im
giving
you
all
my
objections
in
advance
you
have
more
just
one
if
a
sea
exists
at
the
south
pole
its
possible
this
sea
may
be
completely
frozen
over
so
we
couldnt
come
up
to
the
surface
my
dear
sir
have
you
forgotten
that
the
nautilus
is
armed
with
a
fearsome
spur
couldnt
it
be
launched
diagonally
against
those
tracts
of
ice
which
would
break
open
from
the
impact
ah
professor
youre
full
of
ideas
today
besides
captain
i
added
with
still
greater
enthusiasm
why
wouldnt
we
find
open
sea
at
the
south
pole
just
as
at
the
north
pole
the
coldtemperature
poles
and
the
geographical
poles
dont
coincide
in
either
the
northern
or
southern
hemispheres
and
until
proof
to
the
contrary
we
can
assume
these
two
spots
on
the
earth
feature
either
a
continent
or
an
icefree
ocean
i
think
as
you
do
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
replied
ill
only
point
out
that
after
raising
so
many
objections
against
my
plan
youre
now
crushing
me
under
arguments
in
its
favor
captain
nemo
was
right
i
was
outdoing
him
in
daring
it
was
i
who
was
sweeping
him
to
the
pole
i
was
leading
the
way
i
was
out
in
front



but
no
you
silly
fool
captain
nemo
already
knew
the
pros
and
cons
of
this
question
and
it
amused
him
to
see
you
flying
off
into
impossible
fantasies
nevertheless
he
didnt
waste
an
instant
at
his
signal
the
chief
officer
appeared
the
two
men
held
a
quick
exchange
in
their
incomprehensible
language
and
either
the
chief
officer
had
been
alerted
previously
or
he
found
the
plan
feasible
because
he
showed
no
surprise
but
as
unemotional
as
he
was
he
couldnt
have
been
more
impeccably
emotionless
than
conseil
when
i
told
the
fine
lad
our
intention
of
pushing
on
to
the
south
pole
he
greeted
my
announcement
with
the
usual
as
master
wishes
and
i
had
to
be
content
with
that
as
for
ned
land
no
human
shoulders
ever
executed
a
higher
shrug
than
the
pair
belonging
to
our
canadian
honestly
sir
he
told
me
you
and
your
captain
nemo
i
pity
you
both
but
we
will
go
to
the
pole
mr
land
maybe
but
you
wont
come
back
and
ned
land
reentered
his
cabin
to
keep
from
doing
something
desperate
he
said
as
he
left
me
meanwhile
preparations
for
this
daring
attempt
were
getting
under
way
the
nautiluss
powerful
pumps
forced
air
down
into
the
tanks
and
stored
it
under
high
pressure
near
four
oclock
captain
nemo
informed
me
that
the
platform
hatches
were
about
to
be
closed
i
took
a
last
look
at
the
dense
ice
bank
we
were
going
to
conquer
the
weather
was
fair
the
skies
reasonably
clear
the
cold
quite
brisk
namely
12
degrees
centigrade
but
after
the
wind
had
lulled
this
temperature
didnt
seem
too
unbearable
equipped
with
picks
some
ten
men
climbed
onto
the
nautiluss
sides
and
cracked
loose
the
ice
around
the
ships
lower
plating
which
was
soon
set
free
this
operation
was
swiftly
executed
because
the
fresh
ice
was
still
thin
we
all
reentered
the
interior
the
main
ballast
tanks
were
filled
with
the
water
that
hadnt
yet
congealed
at
our
line
of
flotation
the
nautilus
submerged
without
delay
i
took
a
seat
in
the
lounge
with
conseil
through
the
open
window
we
stared
at
the
lower
strata
of
this
southernmost
ocean
the
thermometer
rose
again
the
needle
on
the
pressure
gauge
swerved
over
its
dial
about
300
meters
down
just
as
captain
nemo
had
predicted
we
cruised
beneath
the
undulating
surface
of
the
ice
bank
but
the
nautilus
sank
deeper
still
it
reached
a
depth
of
800
meters
at
the
surface
this
water
gave
a
temperature
of
12
degrees
centigrade
but
now
it
gave
no
more
than
10
degrees
two
degrees
had
already
been
gained
thanks
to
its
heating
equipment
the
nautiluss
temperature
needless
to
say
stayed
at
a
much
higher
degree
every
maneuver
was
accomplished
with
extraordinary
precision
with
all
due
respect
to
master
conseil
told
me
well
pass
it
by
i
fully
expect
to
i
replied
in
a
tone
of
deep
conviction
now
in
open
water
the
nautilus
took
a
direct
course
to
the
pole
without
veering
from
the
52nd
meridian
from
67
degrees
30
to
90
degrees
twentytwo
and
a
half
degrees
of
latitude
were
left
to
cross
in
other
words
slightly
more
than
500
leagues
the
nautilus
adopted
an
average
speed
of
twentysix
miles
per
hour
the
speed
of
an
express
train
if
it
kept
up
this
pace
forty
hours
would
do
it
for
reaching
the
pole
for
part
of
the
night
the
novelty
of
our
circumstances
kept
conseil
and
me
at
the
lounge
window
the
sea
was
lit
by
our
beacons
electric
rays
but
the
depths
were
deserted
fish
didnt
linger
in
these
imprisoned
waters
here
they
found
merely
a
passageway
for
going
from
the
antarctic
ocean
to
open
sea
at
the
pole
our
progress
was
swift
you
could
feel
it
in
the
vibrations
of
the
long
steel
hull
near
two
oclock
in
the
morning
i
went
to
snatch
a
few
hours
of
sleep
conseil
did
likewise
i
didnt
encounter
captain
nemo
while
going
down
the
gangways
i
assumed
that
he
was
keeping
to
the
pilothouse
the
next
day
march
19
at
five
oclock
in
the
morning
i
was
back
at
my
post
in
the
lounge
the
electric
log
indicated
that
the
nautilus
had
reduced
speed
by
then
it
was
rising
to
the
surface
but
cautiously
while
slowly
emptying
its
ballast
tanks
my
heart
was
pounding
would
we
emerge
into
the
open
and
find
the
polar
air
again
no
a
jolt
told
me
that
the
nautilus
had
bumped
the
underbelly
of
the
ice
bank
still
quite
thick
to
judge
from
the
hollowness
of
the
accompanying
noise
indeed
we
had
struck
bottom
to
use
nautical
terminology
but
in
the
opposite
direction
and
at
a
depth
of
3000
feet
that
gave
us
4000
feet
of
ice
overhead
of
which
1000
feet
emerged
above
water
so
the
ice
bank
was
higher
here
than
we
had
found
it
on
the
outskirts
a
circumstance
less
than
encouraging
several
times
that
day
the
nautilus
repeated
the
same
experiment
and
always
it
bumped
against
this
surface
that
formed
a
ceiling
above
it
at
certain
moments
the
ship
encountered
ice
at
a
depth
of
900
meters
denoting
a
thickness
of
1200
meters
of
which
300
meters
rose
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
this
height
had
tripled
since
the
moment
the
nautilus
had
dived
beneath
the
waves
i
meticulously
noted
these
different
depths
obtaining
the
underwater
profile
of
this
upsidedown
mountain
chain
that
stretched
beneath
the
sea
by
evening
there
was
still
no
improvement
in
our
situation
the
ice
stayed
between
400
and
500
meters
deep
it
was
obviously
shrinking
but
what
a
barrier
still
lay
between
us
and
the
surface
of
the
ocean
by
then
it
was
eight
oclock
the
air
inside
the
nautilus
should
have
been
renewed
four
hours
earlier
following
daily
practice
on
board
but
i
didnt
suffer
very
much
although
captain
nemo
hadnt
yet
made
demands
on
the
supplementary
oxygen
in
his
air
tanks
that
night
my
sleep
was
fitful
hope
and
fear
besieged
me
by
turns
i
got
up
several
times
the
nautilus
continued
groping
near
three
oclock
in
the
morning
i
observed
that
we
encountered
the
ice
banks
underbelly
at
a
depth
of
only
fifty
meters
so
only
150
feet
separated
us
from
the
surface
of
the
water
little
by
little
the
ice
bank
was
turning
into
an
ice
field
again
the
mountains
were
changing
back
into
plains
my
eyes
didnt
leave
the
pressure
gauge
we
kept
rising
on
a
diagonal
going
along
this
shiny
surface
that
sparkled
beneath
our
electric
rays
above
and
below
the
ice
bank
was
subsiding
in
long
gradients
mile
after
mile
it
was
growing
thinner
finally
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
on
that
memorable
day
of
march
19
the
lounge
door
opened
captain
nemo
appeared
open
sea
he
told
me
chapter
14
the
south
pole
i
rushed
up
onto
the
platform
yes
open
sea
barely
a
few
sparse
floes
some
moving
icebergs
a
sea
stretching
into
the
distance
hosts
of
birds
in
the
air
and
myriads
of
fish
under
the
waters
which
varied
from
intense
blue
to
olive
green
depending
on
the
depth
the
thermometer
marked
3
degrees
centigrade
it
was
as
if
a
comparative
springtime
had
been
locked
up
behind
that
ice
bank
whose
distant
masses
were
outlined
on
the
northern
horizon
are
we
at
the
pole
i
asked
the
captain
my
heart
pounding
ive
no
idea
he
answered
me
at
noon
well
fix
our
position
but
will
the
sun
show
through
this
mist
i
said
staring
at
the
grayish
sky
no
matter
how
faintly
it
shines
it
will
be
enough
for
me
the
captain
replied
to
the
south
ten
miles
from
the
nautilus
a
solitary
islet
rose
to
a
height
of
200
meters
we
proceeded
toward
it
but
cautiously
because
this
sea
could
have
been
strewn
with
reefs
in
an
hour
we
had
reached
the
islet
two
hours
later
we
had
completed
a
full
circle
around
it
it
measured
four
to
five
miles
in
circumference
a
narrow
channel
separated
it
from
a
considerable
shore
perhaps
a
continent
whose
limits
we
couldnt
see
the
existence
of
this
shore
seemed
to
bear
out
commander
maurys
hypotheses
in
essence
this
ingenious
american
has
noted
that
between
the
south
pole
and
the
60th
parallel
the
sea
is
covered
with
floating
ice
of
dimensions
much
greater
than
any
found
in
the
north
atlantic
from
this
fact
he
drew
the
conclusion
that
the
antarctic
circle
must
contain
considerable
shores
since
icebergs
cant
form
on
the
high
seas
but
only
along
coastlines
according
to
his
calculations
this
frozen
mass
enclosing
the
southernmost
pole
forms
a
vast
ice
cap
whose
width
must
reach
4000
kilometers
meanwhile
to
avoid
running
aground
the
nautilus
halted
three
cable
lengths
from
a
strand
crowned
by
superb
piles
of
rocks
the
skiff
was
launched
to
sea
two
crewmen
carrying
instruments
the
captain
conseil
and
i
were
on
board
it
was
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
i
hadnt
seen
ned
land
no
doubt
in
the
presence
of
the
south
pole
the
canadian
hated
having
to
eat
his
words
a
few
strokes
of
the
oar
brought
the
skiff
to
the
sand
where
it
ran
aground
just
as
conseil
was
about
to
jump
ashore
i
held
him
back
sir
i
told
captain
nemo
to
you
belongs
the
honor
of
first
setting
foot
on
this
shore
yes
sir
the
captain
replied
and
if
i
have
no
hesitation
in
treading
this
polar
soil
its
because
no
human
being
until
now
has
left
a
footprint
here
so
saying
he
leaped
lightly
onto
the
sand
his
heart
must
have
been
throbbing
with
intense
excitement
he
scaled
an
overhanging
rock
that
ended
in
a
small
promontory
and
there
mute
and
motionless
with
crossed
arms
and
blazing
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
laying
claim
to
these
southernmost
regions
after
spending
five
minutes
in
this
trance
he
turned
to
us
whenever
youre
ready
sir
he
called
to
me
i
got
out
conseil
at
my
heels
leaving
the
two
men
in
the
skiff
over
an
extensive
area
the
soil
consisted
of
that
igneous
gravel
called
tuff
reddish
in
color
as
if
made
from
crushed
bricks
the
ground
was
covered
with
slag
lava
flows
and
pumice
stones
its
volcanic
origin
was
unmistakable
in
certain
localities
thin
smoke
holes
gave
off
a
sulfurous
odor
showing
that
the
inner
fires
still
kept
their
wideranging
power
nevertheless
when
i
scaled
a
high
escarpment
i
could
see
no
volcanoes
within
a
radius
of
several
miles
in
these
antarctic
districts
as
is
well
known
sir
james
clark
ross
had
found
the
craters
of
mt
erebus
and
mt
terror
in
fully
active
condition
on
the
167th
meridian
at
latitude
77
degrees
32
the
vegetation
on
this
desolate
continent
struck
me
as
quite
limited
a
few
lichens
of
the
species
usnea
melanoxanthra
sprawled
over
the
black
rocks
the
whole
meager
flora
of
this
region
consisted
of
certain
microscopic
buds
rudimentary
diatoms
made
up
of
a
type
of
cell
positioned
between
two
quartzrich
shells
plus
long
purple
and
crimson
fucus
plants
buoyed
by
small
air
bladders
and
washed
up
on
the
coast
by
the
surf
the
beach
was
strewn
with
mollusks
small
mussels
limpets
smooth
heartshaped
cockles
and
especially
some
sea
butterflies
with
oblong
membranefilled
bodies
whose
heads
are
formed
from
two
rounded
lobes
i
also
saw
myriads
of
those
northernmost
sea
butterflies
three
centimeters
long
which
a
baleen
whale
can
swallow
by
the
thousands
in
one
gulp
the
open
waters
at
the
shoreline
were
alive
with
these
delightful
pteropods
true
butterflies
of
the
sea
among
other
zoophytes
present
in
these
shallows
there
were
a
few
coral
tree
forms
that
according
to
sir
james
clark
ross
live
in
these
antarctic
seas
at
depths
as
great
as
1000
meters
then
small
alcyon
coral
belonging
to
the
species
procellaria
pelagica
also
a
large
number
of
starfish
unique
to
these
climes
plus
some
feather
stars
spangling
the
sand
but
it
was
in
the
air
that
life
was
superabundant
there
various
species
of
birds
flew
and
fluttered
by
the
thousands
deafening
us
with
their
calls
crowding
the
rocks
other
fowl
watched
without
fear
as
we
passed
and
pressed
familiarly
against
our
feet
these
were
auks
as
agile
and
supple
in
water
where
they
are
sometimes
mistaken
for
fast
bonito
as
they
are
clumsy
and
heavy
on
land
they
uttered
outlandish
calls
and
participated
in
numerous
public
assemblies
that
featured
much
noise
but
little
action
among
other
fowl
i
noted
some
sheathbills
from
the
wadingbird
family
the
size
of
pigeons
white
in
color
the
beak
short
and
conical
the
eyes
framed
by
red
circles
conseil
laid
in
a
supply
of
them
because
when
theyre
properly
cooked
these
winged
creatures
make
a
pleasant
dish
in
the
air
there
passed
sooty
albatross
with
fourmeter
wingspans
birds
aptly
dubbed
vultures
of
the
ocean
also
gigantic
petrels
including
several
with
arching
wings
enthusiastic
eaters
of
seal
that
are
known
as
quebrantahuesos
and
cape
pigeons
a
sort
of
small
duck
the
tops
of
their
bodies
black
and
whitein
short
a
whole
series
of
petrels
some
whitish
with
wings
trimmed
in
brown
others
blue
and
exclusive
to
these
antarctic
seas
the
former
so
oily
i
told
conseil
that
inhabitants
of
the
faroe
islands
simply
fit
the
bird
with
a
wick
then
light
it
up
spanish
ospreys
ed
with
that
minor
addition
conseil
replied
these
fowl
would
make
perfect
lamps
after
this
we
should
insist
that
nature
equip
them
with
wicks
in
advance
half
a
mile
farther
on
the
ground
was
completely
riddled
with
penguin
nests
egglaying
burrows
from
which
numerous
birds
emerged
later
captain
nemo
had
hundreds
of
them
hunted
because
their
black
flesh
is
highly
edible
they
brayed
like
donkeys
the
size
of
a
goose
with
slatecolored
bodies
white
undersides
and
lemoncolored
neck
bands
these
animals
let
themselves
be
stoned
to
death
without
making
any
effort
to
get
away
meanwhile
the
mists
didnt
clear
and
by
eleven
oclock
the
sun
still
hadnt
made
an
appearance
its
absence
disturbed
me
without
it
no
sights
were
possible
then
how
could
we
tell
whether
we
had
reached
the
pole
when
i
rejoined
captain
nemo
i
found
him
leaning
silently
against
a
piece
of
rock
and
staring
at
the
sky
he
seemed
impatient
baffled
but
what
could
we
do
this
daring
and
powerful
man
couldnt
control
the
sun
as
he
did
the
sea
noon
arrived
without
the
orb
of
day
appearing
for
a
single
instant
you
couldnt
even
find
its
hiding
place
behind
the
curtain
of
mist
and
soon
this
mist
began
to
condense
into
snow
until
tomorrow
the
captain
said
simply
and
we
went
back
to
the
nautilus
amid
flurries
in
the
air
during
our
absence
the
nets
had
been
spread
and
i
observed
with
fascination
the
fish
just
hauled
on
board
the
antarctic
seas
serve
as
a
refuge
for
an
extremely
large
number
of
migratory
fish
that
flee
from
storms
in
the
subpolar
zones
in
truth
only
to
slide
down
the
gullets
of
porpoises
and
seals
i
noted
some
onedecimeter
southern
bullhead
a
species
of
whitish
cartilaginous
fish
overrun
with
bluish
gray
stripes
and
armed
with
stings
then
some
antarctic
rabbitfish
three
feet
long
the
body
very
slender
the
skin
a
smooth
silver
white
the
head
rounded
the
topside
furnished
with
three
fins
the
snout
ending
in
a
trunk
that
curved
back
toward
the
mouth
i
sampled
its
flesh
but
found
it
tasteless
despite
conseils
views
which
were
largely
approving
the
blizzard
lasted
until
the
next
day
it
was
impossible
to
stay
on
the
platform
from
the
lounge
where
i
was
writing
up
the
incidents
of
this
excursion
to
the
polar
continent
i
could
hear
the
calls
of
petrel
and
albatross
cavorting
in
the
midst
of
the
turmoil
the
nautilus
didnt
stay
idle
and
cruising
along
the
coast
it
advanced
some
ten
miles
farther
south
amid
the
half
light
left
by
the
sun
as
it
skimmed
the
edge
of
the
horizon
the
next
day
march
20
it
stopped
snowing
the
cold
was
a
little
more
brisk
the
thermometer
marked
2
degrees
centigrade
the
mist
had
cleared
and
on
that
day
i
hoped
our
noon
sights
could
be
accomplished
since
captain
nemo
hadnt
yet
appeared
only
conseil
and
i
were
taken
ashore
by
the
skiff
the
soils
nature
was
still
the
same
volcanic
traces
of
lava
slag
and
basaltic
rock
were
everywhere
but
i
couldnt
find
the
crater
that
had
vomited
them
up
there
as
yonder
myriads
of
birds
enlivened
this
part
of
the
polar
continent
but
they
had
to
share
their
dominion
with
huge
herds
of
marine
mammals
that
looked
at
us
with
gentle
eyes
these
were
seals
of
various
species
some
stretched
out
on
the
ground
others
lying
on
drifting
ice
floes
several
leaving
or
reentering
the
sea
having
never
dealt
with
man
they
didnt
run
off
at
our
approach
and
i
counted
enough
of
them
thereabouts
to
provision
a
couple
hundred
ships
ye
gods
conseil
said
its
fortunate
that
ned
land
didnt
come
with
us
why
so
conseil
because
that
madcap
hunter
would
kill
every
animal
here
every
animal
may
be
overstating
it
but
in
truth
i
doubt
we
could
keep
our
canadian
friend
from
harpooning
some
of
these
magnificent
cetaceans
which
would
be
an
affront
to
captain
nemo
since
he
hates
to
slay
harmless
beasts
needlessly
hes
right
certainly
conseil
but
tell
me
havent
you
finished
classifying
these
superb
specimens
of
marine
fauna
master
is
well
aware
conseil
replied
that
im
not
seasoned
in
practical
application
when
master
has
told
me
these
animals
names



theyre
seals
and
walruses
two
genera
our
scholarly
conseil
hastened
to
say
that
belong
to
the
family
pinnipedia
order
carnivora
group
unguiculata
subclass
monodelphia
class
mammalia
branch
vertebrata
very
nice
conseil
i
replied
but
these
two
genera
of
seals
and
walruses
are
each
divided
into
species
and
if
im
not
mistaken
we
now
have
a
chance
to
actually
look
at
them
lets
it
was
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
we
had
four
hours
to
ourselves
before
the
sun
could
be
productively
observed
i
guided
our
steps
toward
a
huge
bay
that
made
a
crescentshaped
incision
in
the
granite
cliffs
along
the
beach
there
all
about
us
i
swear
that
the
shores
and
ice
floes
were
crowded
with
marine
mammals
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
and
i
involuntarily
looked
around
for
old
proteus
that
mythological
shepherd
who
guarded
king
neptunes
immense
flocks
to
be
specific
these
were
seals
they
formed
distinct
maleandfemale
groups
the
father
watching
over
his
family
the
mother
suckling
her
little
ones
the
stronger
youngsters
emancipated
a
few
paces
away
when
these
mammals
wanted
to
relocate
they
moved
in
little
jumps
made
by
contracting
their
bodies
clumsily
helped
by
their
imperfectly
developed
flippers
which
as
with
their
manatee
relatives
form
actual
forearms
in
the
water
their
ideal
element
i
must
say
these
animals
swim
wonderfully
thanks
to
their
flexible
backbones
narrow
pelvises
closecropped
hair
and
webbed
feet
resting
on
shore
they
assumed
extremely
graceful
positions
consequently
their
gentle
features
their
sensitive
expressions
equal
to
those
of
the
loveliest
women
their
soft
limpid
eyes
their
charming
poses
led
the
ancients
to
glorify
them
by
metamorphosing
the
males
into
sea
gods
and
the
females
into
mermaids
i
drew
conseils
attention
to
the
considerable
growth
of
the
cerebral
lobes
found
in
these
intelligent
cetaceans
no
mammal
except
man
has
more
abundant
cerebral
matter
accordingly
seals
are
quite
capable
of
being
educated
they
make
good
pets
and
together
with
certain
other
naturalists
i
think
these
animals
can
be
properly
trained
to
perform
yeoman
service
as
hunting
dogs
for
fishermen
most
of
these
seals
were
sleeping
on
the
rocks
or
the
sand
among
those
properly
termed
sealswhich
have
no
external
ears
unlike
sea
lions
whose
ears
protrudei
observed
several
varieties
of
the
species
stenorhynchus
three
meters
long
with
white
hair
bulldog
heads
and
armed
with
ten
teeth
in
each
jaw
four
incisors
in
both
the
upper
and
lower
plus
two
big
canines
shaped
like
the
fleurdelis
among
them
slithered
some
sea
elephants
a
type
of
seal
with
a
short
flexible
trunk
these
are
the
giants
of
the
species
with
a
circumference
of
twenty
feet
and
a
length
of
ten
meters
they
didnt
move
as
we
approached
are
these
animals
dangerous
conseil
asked
me
only
if
theyre
attacked
i
replied
but
when
these
giant
seals
defend
their
little
ones
their
fury
is
dreadful
and
it
isnt
rare
for
them
to
smash
a
fishermans
longboat
to
bits
theyre
within
their
rights
conseil
answered
i
dont
say
nay
two
miles
farther
on
we
were
stopped
by
a
promontory
that
screened
the
bay
from
southerly
winds
it
dropped
straight
down
to
the
sea
and
surf
foamed
against
it
from
beyond
this
ridge
there
came
fearsome
bellows
such
as
a
herd
of
cattle
might
produce
gracious
conseil
put
in
a
choir
of
bulls
no
i
said
a
choir
of
walruses
are
they
fighting
with
each
other
either
fighting
or
playing
with
all
due
respect
to
master
this
we
must
see
then
see
it
we
must
conseil
and
there
we
were
climbing
these
blackish
rocks
amid
sudden
landslides
and
over
stones
slippery
with
ice
more
than
once
i
took
a
tumble
at
the
expense
of
my
backside
conseil
more
cautious
or
more
stable
barely
faltered
and
would
help
me
up
saying
if
masters
legs
would
kindly
adopt
a
wider
stance
master
will
keep
his
balance
arriving
at
the
topmost
ridge
of
this
promontory
i
could
see
vast
white
plains
covered
with
walruses
these
animals
were
playing
among
themselves
they
were
howling
not
in
anger
but
in
glee
walruses
resemble
seals
in
the
shape
of
their
bodies
and
the
arrangement
of
their
limbs
but
their
lower
jaws
lack
canines
and
incisors
and
as
for
their
upper
canines
they
consist
of
two
tusks
eighty
centimeters
long
with
a
circumference
of
thirtythree
centimeters
at
the
socket
made
of
solid
ivory
without
striations
harder
than
elephant
tusks
and
less
prone
to
yellowing
these
teeth
are
in
great
demand
accordingly
walruses
are
the
victims
of
a
mindless
hunting
that
soon
will
destroy
them
all
since
their
hunters
indiscriminately
slaughter
pregnant
females
and
youngsters
and
over
4000
individuals
are
destroyed
annually
passing
near
these
unusual
animals
i
could
examine
them
at
my
leisure
since
they
didnt
stir
their
hides
were
rough
and
heavy
a
tan
color
leaning
toward
a
reddish
brown
their
coats
were
short
and
less
than
abundant
some
were
four
meters
long
more
tranquil
and
less
fearful
than
their
northern
relatives
they
posted
no
sentinels
on
guard
duty
at
the
approaches
to
their
campsite
after
examining
this
community
of
walruses
i
decided
to
return
in
my
tracks
it
was
eleven
oclock
and
if
captain
nemo
found
conditions
favorable
for
taking
his
sights
i
wanted
to
be
present
at
the
operation
but
i
held
no
hopes
that
the
sun
would
make
an
appearance
that
day
it
was
hidden
from
our
eyes
by
clouds
squeezed
together
on
the
horizon
apparently
the
jealous
orb
didnt
want
to
reveal
this
inaccessible
spot
on
the
globe
to
any
human
being
yet
i
decided
to
return
to
the
nautilus
we
went
along
a
steep
narrow
path
that
ran
over
the
cliffs
summit
by
1130
we
had
arrived
at
our
landing
place
the
beached
skiff
had
brought
the
captain
ashore
i
spotted
him
standing
on
a
chunk
of
basalt
his
instruments
were
beside
him
his
eyes
were
focused
on
the
northern
horizon
along
which
the
sun
was
sweeping
in
its
extended
arc
i
found
a
place
near
him
and
waited
without
speaking
noon
arrived
and
just
as
on
the
day
before
the
sun
didnt
put
in
an
appearance
it
was
sheer
bad
luck
our
noon
sights
were
still
lacking
if
we
couldnt
obtain
them
tomorrow
we
would
finally
have
to
give
up
any
hope
of
fixing
our
position
in
essence
it
was
precisely
march
20
tomorrow
the
21st
was
the
day
of
the
equinox
the
sun
would
disappear
below
the
horizon
for
six
months
not
counting
refraction
and
after
its
disappearance
the
long
polar
night
would
begin
following
the
september
equinox
the
sun
had
emerged
above
the
northerly
horizon
rising
in
long
spirals
until
december
21
at
that
time
the
summer
solstice
of
these
southernmost
districts
the
sun
had
started
back
down
and
tomorrow
it
would
cast
its
last
rays
i
shared
my
thoughts
and
fears
with
captain
nemo
youre
right
professor
aronnax
he
told
me
if
i
cant
take
the
suns
altitude
tomorrow
i
wont
be
able
to
try
again
for
another
six
months
but
precisely
because
sailors
luck
has
led
me
into
these
seas
on
march
21
it
will
be
easy
to
get
our
bearings
if
the
noonday
sun
does
appear
before
our
eyes
why
easy
captain
because
when
the
orb
of
day
sweeps
in
such
long
spirals
its
difficult
to
measure
its
exact
altitude
above
the
horizon
and
our
instruments
are
open
to
committing
serious
errors
then
what
can
you
do
i
use
only
my
chronometer
captain
nemo
answered
me
at
noon
tomorrow
march
21
if
after
accounting
for
refraction
the
suns
disk
is
cut
exactly
in
half
by
the
northern
horizon
that
will
mean
im
at
the
south
pole
right
i
said
nevertheless
it
isnt
mathematically
exact
proof
because
the
equinox
neednt
fall
precisely
at
noon
no
doubt
sir
but
the
error
will
be
under
100
meters
and
thats
close
enough
for
us
until
tomorrow
then
captain
nemo
went
back
on
board
conseil
and
i
stayed
behind
until
five
oclock
surveying
the
beach
observing
and
studying
the
only
unusual
object
i
picked
up
was
an
auks
egg
of
remarkable
size
for
which
a
collector
would
have
paid
more
than
1000
francs
its
creamcolored
tint
plus
the
streaks
and
markings
that
decorated
it
like
so
many
hieroglyphics
made
it
a
rare
trinket
i
placed
it
in
conseils
hands
and
holding
it
like
precious
porcelain
from
china
that
cautious
surefooted
lad
got
it
back
to
the
nautilus
in
one
piece
there
i
put
this
rare
egg
inside
one
of
the
glass
cases
in
the
museum
i
ate
supper
feasting
with
appetite
on
an
excellent
piece
of
seal
liver
whose
flavor
reminded
me
of
pork
then
i
went
to
bed
but
not
without
praying
like
a
good
hindu
for
the
favors
of
the
radiant
orb
the
next
day
march
21
bright
and
early
at
five
oclock
in
the
morning
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
i
found
captain
nemo
there
the
weather
is
clearing
a
bit
he
told
me
i
have
high
hopes
after
breakfast
well
make
our
way
ashore
and
choose
an
observation
post
this
issue
settled
i
went
to
find
ned
land
i
wanted
to
take
him
with
me
the
obstinate
canadian
refused
and
i
could
clearly
see
that
his
tightlipped
mood
and
his
bad
temper
were
growing
by
the
day
under
the
circumstances
i
ultimately
wasnt
sorry
that
he
refused
in
truth
there
were
too
many
seals
ashore
and
it
would
never
do
to
expose
this
impulsive
fisherman
to
such
temptations
breakfast
over
i
made
my
way
ashore
the
nautilus
had
gone
a
few
more
miles
during
the
night
it
lay
well
out
a
good
league
from
the
coast
which
was
crowned
by
a
sharp
peak
400
to
500
meters
high
in
addition
to
me
the
skiff
carried
captain
nemo
two
crewmen
and
the
instrumentsin
other
words
a
chronometer
a
spyglass
and
a
barometer
during
our
crossing
i
saw
numerous
baleen
whales
belonging
to
the
three
species
unique
to
these
southernmost
seas
the
bowhead
whale
or
right
whale
according
to
the
english
which
has
no
dorsal
fin
the
humpback
whale
from
the
genus
balaenoptera
in
other
words
winged
whales
beasts
with
wrinkled
bellies
and
huge
whitish
fins
that
genus
name
regardless
do
not
yet
form
wings
and
the
finback
whale
yellowish
brown
the
swiftest
of
all
cetaceans
this
powerful
animal
is
audible
from
far
away
when
it
sends
up
towering
spouts
of
air
and
steam
that
resemble
swirls
of
smoke
herds
of
these
different
mammals
were
playing
about
in
the
tranquil
waters
and
i
could
easily
see
that
this
antarctic
polar
basin
now
served
as
a
refuge
for
those
cetaceans
too
relentlessly
pursued
by
hunters
i
also
noted
long
whitish
strings
of
salps
a
type
of
mollusk
found
in
clusters
and
some
jellyfish
of
large
size
that
swayed
in
the
eddies
of
the
billows
by
nine
oclock
we
had
pulled
up
to
shore
the
sky
was
growing
brighter
clouds
were
fleeing
to
the
south
mists
were
rising
from
the
cold
surface
of
the
water
captain
nemo
headed
toward
the
peak
which
he
no
doubt
planned
to
make
his
observatory
it
was
an
arduous
climb
over
sharp
lava
and
pumice
stones
in
the
midst
of
air
often
reeking
with
sulfurous
fumes
from
the
smoke
holes
for
a
man
out
of
practice
at
treading
land
the
captain
scaled
the
steepest
slopes
with
a
supple
agility
i
couldnt
equal
and
which
would
have
been
envied
by
hunters
of
pyrenees
mountain
goats
it
took
us
two
hours
to
reach
the
summit
of
this
halfcrystal
halfbasalt
peak
from
there
our
eyes
scanned
a
vast
sea
which
scrawled
its
boundary
line
firmly
against
the
background
of
the
northern
sky
at
our
feet
dazzling
tracts
of
white
over
our
heads
a
pale
azure
clear
of
mists
north
of
us
the
suns
disk
like
a
ball
of
fire
already
cut
into
by
the
edge
of
the
horizon
from
the
heart
of
the
waters
jets
of
liquid
rising
like
hundreds
of
magnificent
bouquets
far
off
like
a
sleeping
cetacean
the
nautilus
behind
us
to
the
south
and
east
an
immense
shore
a
chaotic
heap
of
rocks
and
ice
whose
limits
we
couldnt
see
arriving
at
the
summit
of
this
peak
captain
nemo
carefully
determined
its
elevation
by
means
of
his
barometer
since
he
had
to
take
this
factor
into
account
in
his
noon
sights
at
1145
the
sun
by
then
seen
only
by
refraction
looked
like
a
golden
disk
dispersing
its
last
rays
over
this
deserted
continent
and
down
to
these
seas
not
yet
plowed
by
the
ships
of
man
captain
nemo
had
brought
a
spyglass
with
a
reticular
eyepiece
which
corrected
the
suns
refraction
by
means
of
a
mirror
and
he
used
it
to
observe
the
orb
sinking
little
by
little
along
a
very
extended
diagonal
that
reached
below
the
horizon
i
held
the
chronometer
my
heart
was
pounding
mightily
if
the
lower
half
of
the
suns
disk
disappeared
just
as
the
chronometer
said

we
were
right
at
the
pole

called

replied
in
a
solemn
voice
handing
me
the
spyglass
which
showed
the
orb
of
day
cut
into
two
exactly
equal
parts
by
the
horizon
i
stared
at
the
last
rays
wreathing
this

shadows
were
gradually
climbing
its
gradients

accident
or
incident
the
next
day
march
22
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
preparations
for
departure
began
the
last
gleams
of
twilight
were
melting
into
night
the
cold
was
brisk
the
constellations
were
glittering
with
startling
intensity
the
wonderful
southern
cross
polar
star
of
the
antarctic
regions
twinkled
at
its
zenith
the
thermometer
marked
12
degrees
centigrade
and
a
fresh
breeze
left
a
sharp
nip
in
the
air
ice
floes
were
increasing
over
the
open
water
the
sea
was
starting
to
congeal
everywhere
numerous
blackish
patches
were
spreading
over
its
surface
announcing
the
imminent
formation
of
fresh
ice
obviously
this
southernmost
basin
froze
over
during
its
sixmonth
winter
and
became
utterly
inaccessible
what
happened
to
the
whales
during
this
period
no
doubt
they
went
beneath
the
ice
bank
to
find
more
feasible
seas
as
for
seals
and
walruses
they
were
accustomed
to
living
in
the
harshest
climates
and
stayed
on
in
these
icy
waterways
these
animals
know
by
instinct
how
to
gouge
holes
in
the
ice
fields
and
keep
them
continually
open
they
go
to
these
holes
to
breathe
once
the
birds
have
migrated
northward
to
escape
the
cold
these
marine
mammals
remain
as
sole
lords
of
the
polar
continent
meanwhile
the
ballast
tanks
filled
with
water
and
the
nautilus
sank
slowly
at
a
depth
of
1000
feet
it
stopped
its
propeller
churned
the
waves
and
it
headed
due
north
at
a
speed
of
fifteen
miles
per
hour
near
the
afternoon
it
was
already
cruising
under
the
immense
frozen
carapace
of
the
ice
bank
as
a
precaution
the
panels
in
the
lounge
stayed
closed
because
the
nautiluss
hull
could
run
afoul
of
some
submerged
block
of
ice
so
i
spent
the
day
putting
my
notes
into
final
form
my
mind
was
completely
wrapped
up
in
my
memories
of
the
pole
we
had
reached
that
inaccessible
spot
without
facing
exhaustion
or
danger
as
if
our
seagoing
passenger
carriage
had
glided
there
on
railroad
tracks
and
now
we
had
actually
started
our
return
journey
did
it
still
have
comparable
surprises
in
store
for
me
i
felt
sure
it
did
so
inexhaustible
is
this
series
of
underwater
wonders
as
it
was
in
the
five
and
a
half
months
since
fate
had
brought
us
on
board
we
had
cleared
14000
leagues
and
over
this
track
longer
than
the
earths
equator
so
many
fascinating
or
frightening
incidents
had
beguiled
our
voyage
that
hunting
trip
in
the
crespo
forests
our
running
aground
in
the
torres
strait
the
coral
cemetery
the
pearl
fisheries
of
ceylon
the
arabic
tunnel
the
fires
of
santorini
those
millions
in
the
bay
of
vigo
atlantis
the
south
pole
during
the
night
all
these
memories
crossed
over
from
one
dream
to
the
next
not
giving
my
brain
a
moments
rest
at
three
oclock
in
the
morning
i
was
awakened
by
a
violent
collision
i
sat
up
in
bed
listening
in
the
darkness
and
then
was
suddenly
hurled
into
the
middle
of
my
stateroom
apparently
the
nautilus
had
gone
aground
then
heeled
over
sharply
leaning
against
the
walls
i
dragged
myself
down
the
gangways
to
the
lounge
whose
ceiling
lights
were
on
the
furniture
had
been
knocked
over
fortunately
the
glass
cases
were
solidly
secured
at
the
base
and
had
stood
fast
since
we
were
no
longer
vertical
the
starboard
pictures
were
glued
to
the
tapestries
while
those
to
port
had
their
lower
edges
hanging
a
foot
away
from
the
wall
so
the
nautilus
was
lying
on
its
starboard
side
completely
stationary
to
boot
in
its
interior
i
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
muffled
voices
but
captain
nemo
didnt
appear
just
as
i
was
about
to
leave
the
lounge
ned
land
and
conseil
entered
what
happened
i
instantly
said
to
them
i
came
to
ask
master
that
conseil
replied
damnation
the
canadian
exclaimed
i
know
full
well
what
happened
the
nautilus
has
gone
aground
and
judging
from
the
way
its
listing
i
dont
think
itll
pull
through
like
that
first
time
in
the
torres
strait
but
i
asked
are
we
at
least
back
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
we
have
no
idea
conseil
replied
its
easy
to
find
out
i
answered
i
consulted
the
pressure
gauge
much
to
my
surprise
it
indicated
a
depth
of
360
meters
whats
the
meaning
of
this
i
exclaimed
we
must
confer
with
captain
nemo
conseil
said
but
where
do
we
find
him
ned
land
asked
follow
me
i
told
my
two
companions
we
left
the
lounge
nobody
in
the
library
nobody
by
the
central
companionway
or
the
crews
quarters
i
assumed
that
captain
nemo
was
stationed
in
the
pilothouse
best
to
wait
the
three
of
us
returned
to
the
lounge
ill
skip
over
the
canadians
complaints
he
had
good
grounds
for
an
outburst
i
didnt
answer
him
back
letting
him
blow
off
all
the
steam
he
wanted
we
had
been
left
to
ourselves
for
twenty
minutes
trying
to
detect
the
tiniest
noises
inside
the
nautilus
when
captain
nemo
entered
he
didnt
seem
to
see
us
his
facial
features
usually
so
emotionless
revealed
a
certain
uneasiness
he
studied
the
compass
and
pressure
gauge
in
silence
then
went
and
put
his
finger
on
the
world
map
at
a
spot
in
the
sector
depicting
the
southernmost
seas
i
hesitated
to
interrupt
him
but
some
moments
later
when
he
turned
to
me
i
threw
back
at
him
a
phrase
he
had
used
in
the
torres
strait
an
incident
captain
no
sir
he
replied
this
time
an
accident
serious
perhaps
is
there
any
immediate
danger
no
the
nautilus
has
run
aground
yes
and
this
accident
came
about




through
natures
unpredictability
not
mans
incapacity
no
errors
were
committed
in
our
maneuvers
nevertheless
we
cant
prevent
a
loss
of
balance
from
taking
its
toll
one
may
defy
human
laws
but
no
one
can
withstand
the
laws
of
nature
captain
nemo
had
picked
an
odd
time
to
philosophize
all
in
all
this
reply
told
me
nothing
may
i
learn
sir
i
asked
him
what
caused
this
accident
an
enormous
block
of
ice
an
entire
mountain
has
toppled
over
he
answered
me
when
an
iceberg
is
eroded
at
the
base
by
warmer
waters
or
by
repeated
collisions
its
center
of
gravity
rises
then
it
somersaults
it
turns
completely
upside
down
thats
what
happened
here
when
it
overturned
one
of
these
blocks
hit
the
nautilus
as
it
was
cruising
under
the
waters
sliding
under
our
hull
this
block
then
raised
us
with
irresistible
power
lifting
us
into
less
congested
strata
where
we
now
lie
on
our
side
but
cant
we
float
the
nautilus
clear
by
emptying
its
ballast
tanks
to
regain
our
balance
that
sir
is
being
done
right
now
you
can
hear
the
pumps
working
look
at
the
needle
on
the
pressure
gauge
it
indicates
that
the
nautilus
is
rising
but
this
block
of
ice
is
rising
with
us
and
until
some
obstacle
halts
its
upward
movement
our
position
wont
change
indeed
the
nautilus
kept
the
same
heel
to
starboard
no
doubt
it
would
straighten
up
once
the
block
came
to
a
halt
but
before
that
happened
who
knew
if
we
might
not
hit
the
underbelly
of
the
ice
bank
and
be
hideously
squeezed
between
two
frozen
surfaces
i
mused
on
all
the
consequences
of
this
situation
captain
nemo
didnt
stop
studying
the
pressure
gauge
since
the
toppling
of
this
iceberg
the
nautilus
had
risen
about
150
feet
but
it
still
stayed
at
the
same
angle
to
the
perpendicular
suddenly
a
slight
movement
could
be
felt
over
the
hull
obviously
the
nautilus
was
straightening
a
bit
objects
hanging
in
the
lounge
were
visibly
returning
to
their
normal
positions
the
walls
were
approaching
the
vertical
nobody
said
a
word
hearts
pounding
we
could
see
and
feel
the
ship
righting
itself
the
floor
was
becoming
horizontal
beneath
our
feet
ten
minutes
went
by
finally
were
upright
i
exclaimed
yes
captain
nemo
said
heading
to
the
lounge
door
but
will
we
float
off
i
asked
him
certainly
he
replied
since
the
ballast
tanks
arent
yet
empty
and
when
they
are
the
nautilus
must
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
captain
went
out
and
soon
i
saw
that
at
his
orders
the
nautilus
had
halted
its
upward
movement
in
fact
it
soon
would
have
hit
the
underbelly
of
the
ice
bank
but
it
had
stopped
in
time
and
was
floating
in
midwater
that
was
a
close
call
conseil
then
said
yes
we
could
have
been
crushed
between
these
masses
of
ice
or
at
least
imprisoned
between
them
and
then
with
no
way
to
renew
our
air
supply



yes
that
was
a
close
call
if
its
over
with
ned
land
muttered
i
was
unwilling
to
get
into
a
pointless
argument
with
the
canadian
and
didnt
reply
moreover
the
panels
opened
just
then
and
the
outside
light
burst
through
the
uncovered
windows
we
were
fully
afloat
as
i
have
said
but
on
both
sides
of
the
nautilus
about
ten
meters
away
there
rose
dazzling
walls
of
ice
there
also
were
walls
above
and
below
above
because
the
ice
banks
underbelly
spread
over
us
like
an
immense
ceiling
below
because
the
somersaulting
block
shifting
little
by
little
had
found
points
of
purchase
on
both
side
walls
and
had
gotten
jammed
between
them
the
nautilus
was
imprisoned
in
a
genuine
tunnel
of
ice
about
twenty
meters
wide
and
filled
with
quiet
water
so
the
ship
could
easily
exit
by
going
either
ahead
or
astern
sinking
a
few
hundred
meters
deeper
and
then
taking
an
open
passageway
beneath
the
ice
bank
the
ceiling
lights
were
off
yet
the
lounge
was
still
brightly
lit
this
was
due
to
the
reflecting
power
of
the
walls
of
ice
which
threw
the
beams
of
our
beacon
right
back
at
us
words
cannot
describe
the
effects
produced
by
our
galvanic
rays
on
these
huge
whimsically
sculpted
blocks
whose
every
angle
ridge
and
facet
gave
off
a
different
glow
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
veins
running
inside
the
ice
it
was
a
dazzling
mine
of
gems
in
particular
sapphires
and
emeralds
whose
jets
of
blue
and
green
crisscrossed
here
and
there
opaline
hues
of
infinite
subtlety
raced
among
sparks
of
light
that
were
like
so
many
fiery
diamonds
their
brilliance
more
than
any
eye
could
stand
the
power
of
our
beacon
was
increased
a
hundredfold
like
a
lamp
shining
through
the
biconvex
lenses
of
a
worldclass
lighthouse
how
beautiful
conseil
exclaimed
yes
i
said
its
a
wonderful
sight
isnt
it
ned
oh
damnation
yes
ned
land
shot
back
its
superb
im
furious
that
i
have
to
admit
it
nobody
has
ever
seen
the
like
but
this
sight
could
cost
us
dearly
and
in
all
honesty
i
think
were
looking
at
things
god
never
intended
for
human
eyes
ned
was
right
it
was
too
beautiful
all
at
once
a
yell
from
conseil
made
me
turn
around
what
is
it
i
asked
master
must
close
his
eyes
master
mustnt
look
with
that
conseil
clapped
his
hands
over
his
eyes
but
whats
wrong
my
boy
ive
been
dazzled
struck
blind
involuntarily
my
eyes
flew
to
the
window
but
i
couldnt
stand
the
fire
devouring
it
i
realized
what
had
happened
the
nautilus
had
just
started
off
at
great
speed
all
the
tranquil
glimmers
of
the
ice
walls
had
then
changed
into
blazing
streaks
the
sparkles
from
these
myriads
of
diamonds
were
merging
with
each
other
swept
along
by
its
propeller
the
nautilus
was
traveling
through
a
sheath
of
flashing
light
then
the
panels
in
the
lounge
closed
we
kept
our
hands
over
our
eyes
which
were
utterly
saturated
with
those
concentric
gleams
that
swirl
before
the
retina
when
sunlight
strikes
it
too
intensely
it
took
some
time
to
calm
our
troubled
vision
finally
we
lowered
our
hands
ye
gods
i
never
would
have
believed
it
conseil
said
and
i
still
dont
believe
it
the
canadian
shot
back
when
we
return
to
shore
jaded
from
all
these
natural
wonders
conseil
added
think
how
well
look
down
on
those
pitiful
land
masses
those
puny
works
of
man
no
the
civilized
world
wont
be
good
enough
for
us
such
words
from
the
lips
of
this
emotionless
flemish
boy
showed
that
our
enthusiasm
was
near
the
boiling
point
but
the
canadian
didnt
fail
to
throw
his
dram
of
cold
water
over
us
the
civilized
world
he
said
shaking
his
head
dont
worry
conseil
my
friend
were
never
going
back
to
that
world
by
this
point
it
was
five
oclock
in
the
morning
just
then
there
was
a
collision
in
the
nautiluss
bow
i
realized
that
its
spur
had
just
bumped
a
block
of
ice
it
must
have
been
a
faulty
maneuver
because
this
underwater
tunnel
was
obstructed
by
such
blocks
and
didnt
make
for
easy
navigating
so
i
had
assumed
that
captain
nemo
in
adjusting
his
course
would
go
around
each
obstacle
or
would
hug
the
walls
and
follow
the
windings
of
the
tunnel
in
either
case
our
forward
motion
wouldnt
receive
an
absolute
check
nevertheless
contrary
to
my
expectations
the
nautilus
definitely
began
to
move
backward
were
going
astern
conseil
said
yes
i
replied
apparently
the
tunnel
has
no
way
out
at
this
end
and
so




so
i
said
our
maneuvers
are
quite
simple
well
return
in
our
tracks
and
go
out
the
southern
opening
thats
all
as
i
spoke
i
tried
to
sound
more
confident
than
i
really
felt
meanwhile
the
nautilus
accelerated
its
backward
movement
and
running
with
propeller
in
reverse
it
swept
us
along
at
great
speed
thisll
mean
a
delay
ned
said
what
are
a
few
hours
more
or
less
so
long
as
we
get
out
yes
ned
land
repeated
so
long
as
we
get
out
i
strolled
for
a
little
while
from
the
lounge
into
the
library
my
companions
kept
their
seats
and
didnt
move
soon
i
threw
myself
down
on
a
couch
and
picked
up
a
book
which
my
eyes
skimmed
mechanically
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
conseil
approached
me
saying
is
it
deeply
fascinating
this
volume
master
is
reading
tremendously
fascinating
i
replied
i
believe
it
master
is
reading
his
own
book
my
own
book
indeed
my
hands
were
holding
my
own
work
on
the
great
ocean
depths
i
hadnt
even
suspected
i
closed
the
book
and
resumed
my
strolling
ned
and
conseil
stood
up
to
leave
stay
here
my
friends
i
said
stopping
them
lets
stay
together
until
were
out
of
this
blind
alley
as
master
wishes
conseil
replied
the
hours
passed
i
often
studied
the
instruments
hanging
on
the
lounge
wall
the
pressure
gauge
indicated
that
the
nautilus
stayed
at
a
constant
depth
of
300
meters
the
compass
that
it
kept
heading
south
the
log
that
it
was
traveling
at
a
speed
of
twenty
miles
per
hour
an
excessive
speed
in
such
a
cramped
area
but
captain
nemo
knew
that
by
this
point
there
was
no
such
thing
as
too
fast
since
minutes
were
now
worth
centuries
at
825
a
second
collision
took
place
this
time
astern
i
grew
pale
my
companions
came
over
i
clutched
conseils
hand
our
eyes
questioned
each
other
and
more
directly
than
if
our
thoughts
had
been
translated
into
words
just
then
the
captain
entered
the
lounge
i
went
to
him
our
path
is
barred
to
the
south
i
asked
him
yes
sir
when
it
overturned
that
iceberg

off

shortage
of

consequently
above
below
and
around
the
nautilus
there
were
impenetrable
frozen

we
were
the

the
canadian
banged
a
table
with
his
fearsome
fist
conseil
kept
still
i
stared
at
the
captain
his
face
had
resumed
its
usual
emotionlessness
he
crossed
his
arms
he
pondered
the
nautilus
did
not
stir
the
captain
then
broke
into
speech
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
calm
voice
there
are
two
ways
of
dying
under
the
conditions
in
which
were
placed
this
inexplicable
individual
acted
like
a
mathematics
professor
working
out
a
problem
for
his
pupils
the
first
way
he
went
on
is
death
by
crushing
the
second
is
death
by
asphyxiation
i
dont
mention
the
possibility
of
death
by
starvation
because
the
nautiluss
provisions
will
certainly
last
longer
than
we
will
therefore
lets
concentrate
on
our
chances
of
being
crushed
or
asphyxiated
as
for
asphyxiation
captain
i
replied
that
isnt
a
cause
for
alarm
because
the
air
tanks
are
full
true
captain
nemo
went
on
but
theyll
supply
air
for
only
two
days
now
then
weve
been
buried
beneath
the
waters
for
thirtysix
hours
and
the
nautiluss
heavy
atmosphere
already
needs
renewing
in
another
fortyeight
hours
our
reserve
air
will
be
used
up
well
then
captain
lets
free
ourselves
within
fortyeight
hours
well
try
to
at
least
by
cutting
through
one
of
these
walls
surrounding
us
which
one
i
asked
borings
will
tell
us
that
im
going
to
ground
the
nautilus
on
the
lower
shelf
then
my
men
will
put
on
their
diving
suits
and
attack
the
thinnest
of
these
ice
walls
can
the
panels
in
the
lounge
be
left
open
without
ill
effect
were
no
longer
in
motion
captain
nemo
went
out
hissing
sounds
soon
told
me
that
water
was
being
admitted
into
the
ballast
tanks
the
nautilus
slowly
settled
and
rested
on
the
icy
bottom
at
a
depth
of
350
meters
the
depth
at
which
the
lower
shelf
of
ice
lay
submerged
my
friends
i
said
were
in
a
serious
predicament
but
im
counting
on
your
courage
and
energy
sir
the
canadian
replied
this
is
no
time
to
bore
you
with
my
complaints
im
ready
to
do
anything
i
can
for
the
common
good
excellent
ned
i
said
extending
my
hand
to
the
canadian
i
might
add
he
went
on
that
im
as
handy
with
a
pick
as
a
harpoon
if
i
can
be
helpful
to
the
captain
he
can
use
me
any
way
he
wants
he
wont
turn
down
your
assistance
come
along
ned
i
led
the
canadian
to
the
room
where
the
nautiluss
men
were
putting
on
their
diving
suits
i
informed
the
captain
of
neds
proposition
which
was
promptly
accepted
the
canadian
got
into
his
underwater
costume
and
was
ready
as
soon
as
his
fellow
workers
each
of
them
carried
on
his
back
a
rouquayrol
device
that
the
air
tanks
had
supplied
with
a
generous
allowance
of
fresh
oxygen
a
considerable
but
necessary
drain
on
the
nautiluss
reserves
as
for
the
ruhmkorff
lamps
they
were
unnecessary
in
the
midst
of
these
brilliant
waters
saturated
with
our
electric
rays
after
ned
was
dressed
i
reentered
the
lounge
whose
windows
had
been
uncovered
stationed
next
to
conseil
i
examined
the
strata
surrounding
and
supporting
the
nautilus
some
moments
later
we
saw
a
dozen
crewmen
set
foot
on
the
shelf
of
ice
among
them
ned
land
easily
recognized
by
his
tall
figure
captain
nemo
was
with
them
before
digging
into
the
ice
the
captain
had
to
obtain
borings
to
insure
working
in
the
best
direction
long
bores
were
driven
into
the
side
walls
but
after
fifteen
meters
the
instruments
were
still
impeded
by
the
thickness
of
those
walls
it
was
futile
to
attack
the
ceiling
since
that
surface
was
the
ice
bank
itself
more
than
400
meters
high
captain
nemo
then
bored
into
the
lower
surface
there
we
were
separated
from
the
sea
by
a
tenmeter
barrier
thats
how
thick
the
iceberg
was
from
this
point
on
it
was
an
issue
of
cutting
out
a
piece
equal
in
surface
area
to
the
nautiluss
waterline
this
meant
detaching
about
6500
cubic
meters
to
dig
a
hole
through
which
the
ship
could
descend
below
this
tract
of
ice
work
began
immediately
and
was
carried
on
with
tireless
tenacity
instead
of
digging
all
around
the
nautilus
which
would
have
entailed
even
greater
difficulties
captain
nemo
had
an
immense
trench
outlined
on
the
ice
eight
meters
from
our
port
quarter
then
his
men
simultaneously
staked
it
off
at
several
points
around
its
circumference
soon
their
picks
were
vigorously
attacking
this
compact
matter
and
huge
chunks
were
loosened
from
its
mass
these
chunks
weighed
less
than
the
water
and
by
an
unusual
effect
of
specific
gravity
each
chunk
took
wing
as
it
were
to
the
roof
of
the
tunnel
which
thickened
above
by
as
much
as
it
diminished
below
but
this
hardly
mattered
so
long
as
the
lower
surface
kept
growing
thinner
after
two
hours
of
energetic
work
ned
land
reentered
exhausted
he
and
his
companions
were
replaced
by
new
workmen
including
conseil
and
me
the
nautiluss
chief
officer
supervised
us
the
water
struck
me
as
unusually
cold
but
i
warmed
up
promptly
while
wielding
my
pick
my
movements
were
quite
free
although
they
were
executed
under
a
pressure
of
thirty
atmospheres
after
two
hours
of
work
reentering
to
snatch
some
food
and
rest
i
found
a
noticeable
difference
between
the
clean
elastic
fluid
supplied
me
by
the
rouquayrol
device
and
the
nautiluss
atmosphere
which
was
already
charged
with
carbon
dioxide
the
air
hadnt
been
renewed
in
fortyeight
hours
and
its
lifegiving
qualities
were
considerably
weakened
meanwhile
after
twelve
hours
had
gone
by
we
had
removed
from
the
outlined
surface
area
a
slice
of
ice
only
one
meter
thick
hence
about
600
cubic
meters
assuming
the
same
work
would
be
accomplished
every
twelve
hours
it
would
still
take
five
nights
and
four
days
to
see
the
undertaking
through
to
completion
five
nights
and
four
days
i
told
my
companions
and
we
have
oxygen
in
the
air
tanks
for
only
two
days
without
taking
into
account
ned
answered
that
once
were
out
of
this
damned
prison
well
still
be
cooped
up
beneath
the
ice
bank
without
any
possible
contact
with
the
open
air
an
apt
remark
for
who
could
predict
the
minimum
time
we
would
need
to
free
ourselves
before
the
nautilus
could
return
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
couldnt
we
all
die
of
asphyxiation
were
this
ship
and
everyone
on
board
doomed
to
perish
in
this
tomb
of
ice
it
was
a
dreadful
state
of
affairs
but
we
faced
it
headon
each
one
of
us
determined
to
do
his
duty
to
the
end
during
the
night
in
line
with
my
forecasts
a
new
onemeter
slice
was
removed
from
this
immense
socket
but
in
the
morning
wearing
my
diving
suit
i
was
crossing
through
the
liquid
mass
in
a
temperature
of
6
degrees
to
7
degrees
centigrade
when
i
noted
that
little
by
little
the
side
walls
were
closing
in
on
each
other
the
liquid
strata
farthest
from
the
trench
not
warmed
by
the
movements
of
workmen
and
tools
were
showing
a
tendency
to
solidify
in
the
face
of
this
imminent
new
danger
what
would
happen
to
our
chances
for
salvation
and
how
could
we
prevent
this
liquid
medium
from
solidifying
then
cracking
the
nautiluss
hull
like
glass
i
didnt
tell
my
two
companions
about
this
new
danger
there
was
no
point
in
dampening
the
energy
they
were
putting
into
our
arduous
rescue
work
but
when
i
returned
on
board
i
mentioned
this
serious
complication
to
captain
nemo
i
know
he
told
me
in
that
calm
tone
the
most
dreadful
outlook
couldnt
change
its
one
more
danger
but
i
dont
know
any
way
of
warding
it
off
our
sole
chance
for
salvation
is
to
work
faster
than
the
water
solidifies
weve
got
to
get
there
first
thats
all
get
there
first
by
then
i
should
have
been
used
to
this
type
of
talk
for
several
hours
that
day
i
wielded
my
pick
doggedly
the
work
kept
me
going
besides
working
meant
leaving
the
nautilus
which
meant
breathing
the
clean
oxygen
drawn
from
the
air
tanks
and
supplied
by
our
equipment
which
meant
leaving
the
thin
foul
air
behind
near
evening
one
more
meter
had
been
dug
from
the
trench
when
i
returned
on
board
i
was
wellnigh
asphyxiated
by
the
carbon
dioxide
saturating
the
air
oh
if
only
we
had
the
chemical
methods
that
would
enable
us
to
drive
out
this
noxious
gas
there
was
no
lack
of
oxygen
all
this
water
contained
a
considerable
amount
and
after
it
was
decomposed
by
our
powerful
batteries
this
lifegiving
elastic
fluid
could
have
been
restored
to
us
i
had
thought
it
all
out
but
to
no
avail
because
the
carbon
dioxide
produced
by
our
breathing
permeated
every
part
of
the
ship
to
absorb
it
we
would
need
to
fill
containers
with
potassium
hydroxide
and
shake
them
continually
but
this
substance
was
missing
on
board
and
nothing
else
could
replace
it
that
evening
captain
nemo
was
forced
to
open
the
spigots
of
his
air
tanks
and
shoot
a
few
spouts
of
fresh
oxygen
through
the
nautiluss
interior
without
this
precaution
we
wouldnt
have
awakened
the
following
morning
the
next
day
march
26
i
returned
to
my
miners
trade
working
to
remove
the
fifth
meter
the
ice
banks
side
walls
and
underbelly
had
visibly
thickened
obviously
they
would
come
together
before
the
nautilus
could
break
free
for
an
instant
i
was
gripped
by
despair
my
pick
nearly
slipped
from
my
hands
what
was
the
point
of
this
digging
if
i
was
to
die
smothered
and
crushed
by
this
water
turning
to
stone
a
torture
undreamed
of
by
even
the
wildest
savages
i
felt
like
i
was
lying
in
the
jaws
of
a
fearsome
monster
jaws
irresistibly
closing
supervising
our
work
working
himself
captain
nemo
passed
near
me
just
then
i
touched
him
with
my
hand
and
pointed
to
the
walls
of
our
prison
the
starboard
wall
had
moved
forward
to
a
point
less
than
four
meters
from
the
nautiluss
hull
the
captain
understood
and
gave
me
a
signal
to
follow
him
we
returned
on
board
my
diving
suit
removed
i
went
with
him
to
the
lounge
professor
aronnax
he
told
me
this
calls
for
heroic
measures
or
well
be
sealed
up
in
this
solidified
water
as
if
it
were
cement
yes
i
said
but
what
can
we
do
oh
he
exclaimed
if
only
my
nautilus
were
strong
enough
to
stand
that
much
pressure
without
being
crushed
well
i
asked
not
catching
the
captains
meaning
dont
you
understand
he
went
on
that
the
congealing
of
this
water
could
come
to
our
rescue
dont
you
see
that
by
solidifying
it
could
burst
these
tracts
of
ice
imprisoning
us
just
as
its
freezing
can
burst
the
hardest
stones
arent
you
aware
that
this
force
could
be
the
instrument
of
our
salvation
rather
than
our
destruction
yes
captain
maybe
so
but
whatever
resistance
to
crushing
the
nautilus
may
have
it
still
couldnt
stand
such
dreadful
pressures
and
it
would
be
squashed
as
flat
as
a
piece
of
sheet
iron
i
know
it
sir
so
we
cant
rely
on
nature
to
rescue
us
only
our
own
efforts
we
must
counteract
this
solidification
we
must
hold
it
in
check
not
only
are
the
side
walls
closing
in
but
there
arent
ten
feet
of
water
ahead
or
astern
of
the
nautilus
all
around
us
this
freeze
is
gaining
fast
how
long
i
asked
will
the
oxygen
in
the
air
tanks
enable
us
to
breathe
on
board
the
captain
looked
me
straight
in
the
eye
after
tomorrow
he
said
the
air
tanks
will
be
empty
i
broke
out
in
a
cold
sweat
but
why
should
i
have
been
startled
by
this
reply
on
march
22
the
nautilus
had
dived
under
the
open
waters
at
the
pole
it
was
now
the
26th
we
had
lived
off
the
ships
stores
for
five
days
and
all
remaining
breathable
air
had
to
be
saved
for
the
workmen
even
today
as
i
write
these
lines
my
sensations
are
so
intense
that
an
involuntary
terror
sweeps
over
me
and
my
lungs
still
seem
short
of
air
meanwhile
motionless
and
silent
captain
nemo
stood
lost
in
thought
an
idea
visibly
crossed
his
mind
but
he
seemed
to
brush
it
aside
he
told
himself
no
at
last
these
words
escaped
his
lips
boiling
water
he
muttered
boiling
water
i
exclaimed
yes
sir
were
shut
up
in
a
relatively
confined
area
if
the
nautiluss
pumps
continually
injected
streams
of
boiling
water
into
this
space
wouldnt
that
raise
its
temperature
and
delay
its
freezing
its
worth
trying
i
said
resolutely
so
lets
try
it
professor
by
then
the
thermometer
gave
7
degrees
centigrade
outside
captain
nemo
led
me
to
the
galley
where
a
huge
distilling
mechanism
was
at
work
supplying
drinking
water
via
evaporation
the
mechanism
was
loaded
with
water
and
the
full
electric
heat
of
our
batteries
was
thrown
into
coils
awash
in
liquid
in
a
few
minutes
the
water
reached
100
degrees
centigrade
it
was
sent
to
the
pumps
while
new
water
replaced
it
in
the
process
the
heat
generated
by
our
batteries
was
so
intense
that
after
simply
going
through
the
mechanism
water
drawn
cold
from
the
sea
arrived
boiling
hot
at
the
body
of
the
pump
the
steaming
water
was
injected
into
the
icy
water
outside
and
after
three
hours
had
passed
the
thermometer
gave
the
exterior
temperature
as
6
degrees
centigrade
that
was
one
degree
gained
two
hours
later
the
thermometer
gave
only
4
degrees
after
i
monitored
the
operations
progress
doublechecking
it
with
many
inspections
i
told
the
captain
its
working
i
think
so
he
answered
me
weve
escaped
being
crushed
now
we
have
only
asphyxiation
to
fear
during
the
night
the
water
temperature
rose
to
1
degrees
centigrade
the
injections
couldnt
get
it
to
go
a
single
degree
higher
but
since
salt
water
freezes
only
at
2
degrees
i
was
finally
assured
that
there
was
no
danger
of
it
solidifying
by
the
next
day
march
27
six
meters
of
ice
had
been
torn
from
the
socket
only
four
meters
were
left
to
be
removed
that
still
meant
fortyeight
hours
of
work
the
air
couldnt
be
renewed
in
the
nautiluss
interior
accordingly
that
day
it
kept
getting
worse
an
unbearable
heaviness
weighed
me
down
near
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
this
agonizing
sensation
affected
me
to
an
intense
degree
yawns
dislocated
my
jaws
my
lungs
were
gasping
in
their
quest
for
that
enkindling
elastic
fluid
required
for
breathing
now
growing
scarcer
and
scarcer
my
mind
was
in
a
daze
i
lay
outstretched
strength
gone
nearly
unconscious
my
gallant
conseil
felt
the
same
symptoms
suffered
the
same
sufferings
yet
never
left
my
side
he
held
my
hand
he
kept
encouraging
me
and
i
even
heard
him
mutter
oh
if
only
i
didnt
have
to
breathe
to
leave
more
air
for
master
it
brought
tears
to
my
eyes
to
hear
him
say
these
words
since
conditions
inside
were
universally
unbearable
how
eagerly
how
happily
we
put
on
our
diving
suits
to
take
our
turns
working
picks
rang
out
on
that
bed
of
ice
arms
grew
weary
hands
were
rubbed
raw
but
who
cared
about
exhaustion
what
difference
were
wounds
lifesustaining
air
reached
our
lungs
we
could
breathe
we
could
breathe
and
yet
nobody
prolonged
his
underwater
work
beyond
the
time
allotted
him
his
shift
over
each
man
surrendered
to
a
gasping
companion
the
air
tank
that
would
revive
him
captain
nemo
set
the
example
and
was
foremost
in
submitting
to
this
strict
discipline
when
his
time
was
up
he
yielded
his
equipment
to
another
and
reentered
the
foul
air
on
board
always
calm
unflinching
and
uncomplaining
that
day
the
usual
work
was
accomplished
with
even
greater
energy
over
the
whole
surface
area
only
two
meters
were
left
to
be
removed
only
two
meters
separated
us
from
the
open
sea
but
the
ships
air
tanks
were
nearly
empty
the
little
air
that
remained
had
to
be
saved
for
the
workmen
not
an
atom
for
the
nautilus
when
i
returned
on
board
i
felt
half
suffocated
what
a
night
im
unable
to
depict
it
such
sufferings
are
indescribable
the
next
day
i
was
shortwinded
headaches
and
staggering
fits
of
dizziness
made
me
reel
like
a
drunk
my
companions
were
experiencing
the
same
symptoms
some
crewmen
were
at
their
last
gasp
that
day
the
sixth
of
our
imprisonment
captain
nemo
concluded
that
picks
and
mattocks
were
too
slow
to
deal
with
the
ice
layer
still
separating
us
from
open
waterand
he
decided
to
crush
this
layer
the
man
had
kept
his
energy
and
composure
he
had
subdued
physical
pain
with
moral
strength
he
could
still
think
plan
and
act
at
his
orders
the
craft
was
eased
off
in
other
words
it
was
raised
from
its
icy
bed
by
a
change
in
its
specific
gravity
when
it
was
afloat
the
crew
towed
it
leading
it
right
above
the
immense
trench
outlined
to
match
the
ships
waterline
next
the
ballast
tanks
filled
with
water
the
boat
sank
and
was
fitted
into
its
socket
just
then
the
whole
crew
returned
on
board
and
the
double
outside
door
was
closed
by
this
point
the
nautilus
was
resting
on
a
bed
of
ice
only
one
meter
thick
and
drilled
by
bores
in
a
thousand
places
the
stopcocks
of
the
ballast
tanks
were
then
opened
wide
and
100
cubic
meters
of
water
rushed
in
increasing
the
nautiluss
weight
by
100000
kilograms
we
waited
we
listened
we
forgot
our
sufferings
we
hoped
once
more
we
had
staked
our
salvation
on
this
one
last
gamble
despite
the
buzzing
in
my
head
i
soon
could
hear
vibrations
under
the
nautiluss
hull
we
tilted
the
ice
cracked
with
an
odd
ripping
sound
like
paper
tearing
and
the
nautilus
began
settling
downward
were
going
through
conseil
muttered
in
my
ear
i
couldnt
answer
him
i
clutched
his
hand
i
squeezed
it
in
an
involuntary
convulsion
all
at
once
carried
away
by
its
frightful
excess
load
the
nautilus
sank
into
the
waters
like
a
cannonball
in
other
words
dropping
as
if
in
a
vacuum
our
full
electric
power
was
then
put
on
the
pumps
which
instantly
began
to
expel
water
from
the
ballast
tanks
after
a
few
minutes
we
had
checked
our
fall
the
pressure
gauge
soon
indicated
an
ascending
movement
brought
to
full
speed
the
propeller
made
the
sheetiron
hull
tremble
down
to
its
rivets
and
we
sped
northward
but
how
long
would
it
take
to
navigate
under
the
ice
bank
to
the
open
sea
another
day
i
would
be
dead
first
half
lying
on
a
couch
in
the
library
i
was
suffocating
my
face
was
purple
my
lips
blue
my
faculties
in
abeyance
i
could
no
longer
see
or
hear
i
had
lost
all
sense
of
time
my
muscles
had
no
power
to
contract
im
unable
to
estimate
the
hours
that
passed
in
this
way
but
i
was
aware
that
my
death
throes
had
begun
i
realized
that
i
was
about
to
die



suddenly
i
regained
consciousness
a
few
whiffs
of
air
had
entered
my
lungs
had
we
risen
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
had
we
cleared
the
ice
bank
no
ned
and
conseil
my
two
gallant
friends
were
sacrificing
themselves
to
save
me
a
few
atoms
of
air
were
still
left
in
the
depths
of
one
rouquayrol
device
instead
of
breathing
it
themselves
they
had
saved
it
for
me
and
while
they
were
suffocating
they
poured
life
into
me
drop
by
drop
i
tried
to
push
the
device
away
they
held
my
hands
and
for
a
few
moments
i
could
breathe
luxuriously
my
eyes
flew
toward
the
clock
it
was
eleven
in
the
morning
it
had
to
be
march
28
the
nautilus
was
traveling
at
the
frightful
speed
of
forty
miles
per
hour
it
was
writhing
in
the
waters
where
was
captain
nemo
had
he
perished
had
his
companions
died
with
him
just
then
the
pressure
gauge
indicated
we
were
no
more
than
twenty
feet
from
the
surface
separating
us
from
the
open
air
was
a
mere
tract
of
ice
could
we
break
through
it
perhaps
in
any
event
the
nautilus
was
going
to
try
in
fact
i
could
feel
it
assuming
an
oblique
position
lowering
its
stern
and
raising
its
spur
the
admission
of
additional
water
was
enough
to
shift
its
balance
then
driven
by
its
powerful
propeller
it
attacked
this
ice
field
from
below
like
a
fearsome
battering
ram
it
split
the
barrier
little
by
little
backing
up
then
putting
on
full
speed
against
the
punctured
tract
of
ice
and
finally
carried
away
by
its
supreme
momentum
it
lunged
through
and
onto
this
frozen
surface
crushing
the
ice
beneath
its
weight
the
hatches
were
openedor

off

from

to
the
amazon
how
i
got
onto
the
platform
im
unable
to
say
perhaps
the
canadian
transferred
me
there
but
i
could
breathe
i
could
inhale
the
lifegiving
sea
air
next
to
me
my
two
companions
were
getting
tipsy
on
the
fresh
oxygen
particles
poor
souls
who
have
suffered
from
long
starvation
mustnt
pounce
heedlessly
on
the
first
food
given
them
we
on
the
other
hand
didnt
have
to
practice
such
moderation
we
could
suck
the
atoms
from
the
air
by
the
lungful
and
it
was
the
breeze
the
breeze
itself
that
poured
into
us
this
luxurious
intoxication
ahhh
conseil
was
putting
in
what
fine
oxygen
let
master
have
no
fears
about
breathing
theres
enough
for
everyone
as
for
ned
land
he
didnt
say
a
word
but
his
wideopen
jaws
would
have
scared
off
a
shark
and
what
powerful
inhalations
the
canadian
drew
like
a
furnace
going
full
blast
our
strength
returned
promptly
and
when
i
looked
around
i
saw
that
we
were
alone
on
the
platform
no
crewmen
not
even
captain
nemo
those
strange
seamen
on
the
nautilus
were
content
with
the
oxygen
circulating
inside
not
one
of
them
had
come
up
to
enjoy
the
open
air
the
first
words
i
pronounced
were
words
of
appreciation
and
gratitude
to
my
two
companions
ned
and
conseil
had
kept
me
alive
during
the
final
hours
of
our
long
death
throes
but
no
expression
of
thanks
could
repay
them
fully
for
such
devotion
good
lord
professor
ned
land
answered
me
dont
mention
it
what
did
we
do
thats
so
praiseworthy
not
a
thing
it
was
a
question
of
simple
arithmetic
your
life
is
worth
more
than
ours
so
we
had
to
save
it
no
ned
i
replied
it
isnt
worth
more
nobody
could
be
better
than
a
kind
and
generous
man
like
yourself
all
right
all
right
the
canadian
repeated
in
embarrassment
and
you
my
gallant
conseil
you
suffered
a
great
deal
not
too
much
to
be
candid
with
master
i
was
lacking
a
few
throatfuls
of
air
but
i
would
have
gotten
by
besides
when
i
saw
master
fainting
it
left
me
without
the
slightest
desire
to
breathe
it
took
my
breath
away
in
a
manner
of



confounded
by
this
lapse
into
banality
conseil
left
his
sentence
hanging
my
friends
i
replied
very
moved
were
bound
to
each
other
forever
and
im
deeply
indebted
to
you
which
ill
take
advantage
of
the
canadian
shot
back
eh
conseil
put
in
yes
ned
land
went
on
you
can
repay
your
debt
by
coming
with
me
when
i
leave
this
infernal
nautilus
by
the
way
conseil
said
are
we
going
in
a
favorable
direction
yes
i
replied
because
were
going
in
the
direction
of
the
sun
and
here
the
sun
is
due
north
sure
ned
land
went
on
but
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
well
make
for
the
atlantic
or
the
pacific
in
other
words
whether
well
end
up
in
welltraveled
or
deserted
seas
i
had
no
reply
to
this
and
i
feared
that
captain
nemo
wouldnt
take
us
homeward
but
rather
into
that
huge
ocean
washing
the
shores
of
both
asia
and
america
in
this
way
he
would
complete
his
underwater
tour
of
the
world
going
back
to
those
seas
where
the
nautilus
enjoyed
the
greatest
freedom
but
if
we
returned
to
the
pacific
far
from
every
populated
shore
what
would
happen
to
ned
lands
plans
we
would
soon
settle
this
important
point
the
nautilus
traveled
swiftly
soon
we
had
cleared
the
antarctic
circle
plus
the
promontory
of
cape
horn
we
were
abreast
of
the
tip
of
south
america
by
march
31
at
seven
oclock
in
the
evening
by
then
all
our
past
sufferings
were
forgotten
the
memory
of
that
imprisonment
under
the
ice
faded
from
our
minds
we
had
thoughts
only
of
the
future
captain
nemo
no
longer
appeared
neither
in
the
lounge
nor
on
the
platform
the
positions
reported
each
day
on
the
world
map
were
put
there
by
the
chief
officer
and
they
enabled
me
to
determine
the
nautiluss
exact
heading
now
then
that
evening
it
became
obvious
much
to
my
satisfaction
that
we
were
returning
north
by
the
atlantic
route
i
shared
the
results
of
my
observations
with
the
canadian
and
conseil
thats
good
news
the
canadian
replied
but
wheres
the
nautilus
going
im
unable
to
say
ned
after
the
south
pole
does
our
captain
want
to
tackle
the
north
pole
then
go
back
to
the
pacific
by
the
notorious
northwest
passage
i
wouldnt
double
dare
him
conseil
replied
oh
well
the
canadian
said
well
give
him
the
slip
long
before
then
in
any
event
conseil
added
hes
a
superman
that
captain
nemo
and
well
never
regret
having
known
him
especially
once
weve
left
him
ned
land
shot
back
the
next
day
april
1
when
the
nautilus
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
a
few
minutes
before
noon
we
raised
land
to
the
west
it
was
tierra
del
fuego
the
land
of
fire
a
name
given
it
by
early
navigators
after
they
saw
numerous
curls
of
smoke
rising
from
the
natives
huts
this
land
of
fire
forms
a
huge
cluster
of
islands
over
thirty
leagues
long
and
eighty
leagues
wide
extending
between
latitude
53
degrees
and
56
degrees
south
and
between
longitude
67
degrees
50
and
77
degrees
15
west
its
coastline
looked
flat
but
high
mountains
rose
in
the
distance
i
even
thought
i
glimpsed
mt
sarmiento
whose
elevation
is
2070
meters
above
sea
level
a
pyramidshaped
block
of
shale
with
a
very
sharp
summit
which
depending
on
whether
its
clear
or
veiled
in
vapor
predicts
fair
weather
or
foul
as
ned
land
told
me
a
firstclass
barometer
my
friend
yes
sir
a
natural
barometer
that
didnt
let
me
down
when
i
navigated
the
narrows
of
the
strait
of
magellan
just
then
its
peak
appeared
before
us
standing
out
distinctly
against
the
background
of
the
skies
this
forecast
fair
weather
and
so
it
proved
going
back
under
the
waters
the
nautilus
drew
near
the
coast
cruising
along
it
for
only
a
few
miles
through
the
lounge
windows
i
could
see
long
creepers
and
gigantic
fucus
plants
bulbbearing
seaweed
of
which
the
open
sea
at
the
pole
had
revealed
a
few
specimens
with
their
smooth
viscous
filaments
they
measured
as
much
as
300
meters
long
genuine
cables
more
than
an
inch
thick
and
very
tough
theyre
often
used
as
mooring
lines
for
ships
another
weed
known
by
the
name
velp
and
boasting
fourfoot
leaves

crammed
into
the

carpeted
the

floor
it
served
as
both
nest
and
nourishment
for
myriads
of
crustaceans
and
mollusks
for
crabs
and
cuttlefish
here
seals
and
otters
could
indulge
in
a
sumptuous
meal
mixing
meat
from
fish
with
vegetables
from
the
sea
like
the
english
with
their
irish
stews
the
nautilus
passed
over
these
lush
luxuriant
depths
with
tremendous
speed
near
evening
it
approached
the
falkland
islands
whose
rugged
summits
i
recognized
the
next
day
the
sea
was
of
moderate
depth
so
not
without
good
reason
i
assumed
that
these
two
islands
plus
the
many
islets
surrounding
them
used
to
be
part
of
the
magellan
coastline
the
falkland
islands
were
probably
discovered
by
the
famous
navigator
john
davis
who
gave
them
the
name
davis
southern
islands
later
sir
richard
hawkins
called
them
the
maidenland
after
the
blessed
virgin
subsequently
at
the
beginning
of
the
18th
century
they
were
named
the
malouines
by
fishermen
from
saintmalo
in
brittany
then
finally
dubbed
the
falklands
by
the
english
to
whom
they
belong
today
in
these
waterways
our
nets
brought
up
fine
samples
of
algae
in
particular
certain
fucus
plants
whose
roots
were
laden
with
the
worlds
best
mussels
geese
and
duck
alighted
by
the
dozens
on
the
platform
and
soon
took
their
places
in
the
ships
pantry
as
for
fish
i
specifically
observed
some
bony
fish
belonging
to
the
goby
genus
especially
some
gudgeon
two
decimeters
long
sprinkled
with
whitish
and
yellow
spots
i
likewise
marveled
at
the
numerous
medusas
including
the
most
beautiful
of
their
breed
the
compass
jellyfish
unique
to
the
falkland
seas
some
of
these
jellyfish
were
shaped
like
very
smooth
semispheric
parasols
with
russet
stripes
and
fringes
of
twelve
neat
festoons
others
looked
like
upsidedown
baskets
from
which
wide
leaves
and
long
red
twigs
were
gracefully
trailing
they
swam
with
quiverings
of
their
four
leaflike
arms
letting
the
opulent
tresses
of
their
tentacles
dangle
in
the
drift
i
wanted
to
preserve
a
few
specimens
of
these
delicate
zoophytes
but
they
were
merely
clouds
shadows
illusions
melting
and
evaporating
outside
their
native
element
when
the
last
tips
of

disappeared

captain

had
no

for

he
shot

with
dizzying

not
even
the

could
keep

by
means
of

the

would
do
long
diagonal

took
us
to

but
on

it
rose
suddenly
and
the

reappeared
at
the
mouth
of
the

huge

considerable
it

the

wont
keep
me
from
mentioning
one
more
fish
that
conseil
with
good
reason
will
long
remember
one
of
our
nets
had
hauled
up
a
type
of
very
flat
ray
that
weighed
some
twenty
kilograms
with
its
tail
cut
off
it
would
have
formed
a
perfect

it
was
white
underneath
and
reddish
on
top
with
big
round
spots
of
deep
blue
encircled
in
black
its
hide
quite
smooth
and
ending
in
a
doublelobed
fin
laid
out
on
the
platform
it
kept
struggling
with
convulsive
movements
trying
to
turn
over
making
such
efforts
that
its
final
lunge
was
about
to
flip
it
into
the
sea
but
conseil
being
very
possessive
of
his
fish
rushed
at
it
and
before
i
could
stop
him
he
seized
it
with
both
hands
instantly
there
he
was
thrown
on
his
back
legs
in
the
air
his
body
half
paralyzed
and
yelling
oh
sir
sir

you
help
me
for
once
in
his

the
poor
lad
didnt
address
me
in
the
third
person
the
canadian
and
i
sat
him
up
we
massaged
his
contracted
arms
and
when
he
regained
his
five
senses

put
you

deplorable
state
oh
master
can
trust
me
on
this
conseil
shot
back
ill
be
revenged
on
that
animal
how
ill
eat
it
which
he
did
that
same
evening
but
strictly
as
retaliation
because
frankly
it
tasted
like
leather
poor
conseil
had
assaulted
an
electric
ray
of
the
most
dangerous
species
the
cumana
living
in
a
conducting
medium
such
as
water
this
bizarre
animal
can
electrocute
other
fish
from
several
meters
away
so
great
is
the
power
of
its
electric
organ
an
organ
whose
two
chief
surfaces
measure
at
least
twentyseven
square
feet
during
the
course
of
the
next
day
april
12
the
nautilus
drew
near
the
coast
of
dutch
guiana
by
the
mouth
of
the
maroni
river
there
several
groups
of
sea
cows
were
living
in
family
units
these
were
manatees
which
belong
to
the
order
sirenia
like
the
dugong
and
stellers
sea
cow
harmless
and
unaggressive
these
fine
animals
were
six
to
seven
meters
long
and
must
have
weighed
at
least
4000
kilograms
each
i
told
ned
land
and
conseil
that
farseeing
nature
had
given
these
mammals
a
major
role
to
play
in
essence
manatees
like
seals
are
designed
to
graze
the
underwater
prairies
destroying
the
clusters
of
weeds
that
obstruct
the
mouths
of
tropical
rivers
and
do
you
know
i
added
what
happened
since
man
has
almost
completely
wiped
out
these
beneficial
races
rotting
weeds
have
poisoned
the
air
and
this
poisoned
air
causes
the
yellow
fever
that
devastates
these
wonderful
countries
this
toxic
vegetation
has
increased
beneath
the
seas
of
the
torrid
zone
so
the
disease
spreads
unchecked
from
the
mouth
of
the
rio
de
la
plata
to
florida
and
if
professor
toussenel
is
correct
this
plague
is
nothing
compared
to
the
scourge
that
will
strike
our
descendants
once
the
seas
are
depopulated
of
whales
and
seals
by
then
crowded
with
jellyfish
squid
and
other
devilfish
the
oceans
will
have
become
huge
centers
of
infection
because
their
waves
will
no
longer
possess
these
huge
stomachs
that
god
has
entrusted
with
scouring
the
surface
of
the
sea
meanwhile
without
scorning
these
theories
the
nautiluss
crew
captured
half
a
dozen
manatees
in
essence
it
was
an
issue
of
stocking
the
larder
with
excellent
red
meat
even
better
than
beef
or
veal
their
hunting
was
not
a
fascinating
sport
the
manatees
let
themselves
be
struck
down
without
offering
any
resistance
several
thousand
kilos
of
meat
were
hauled
below
to
be
dried
and
stored
the
same
day
an
odd
fishing
practice
further
increased
the
nautiluss
stores
so
full
of
game
were
these
seas
our
trawl
brought
up
in
its
meshes
a
number
of
fish
whose
heads
were
topped
by
little
oval
slabs
with
fleshy
edges
these
were
suckerfish
from
the
third
family
of
the
subbrachian
malacopterygia
these
flat
disks
on
their
heads
consist
of
crosswise
plates
of
movable
cartilage
between
which
the
animals
can
create
a
vacuum
enabling
them
to
stick
to
objects
like
suction
cups
the
remoras
i
had
observed
in
the
mediterranean
were
related
to
this
species
but
the
creature
at
issue
here
was
an
echeneis
osteochara
unique
to
this
sea
right
after
catching
them
our
seamen
dropped
them
in
buckets
of
water
its
fishing
finished
the
nautilus
drew
nearer
to
the
coast
in
this
locality
a
number
of
sea
turtles
were
sleeping
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
capture
these
valuable
reptiles
because
they
wake
up
at
the
slightest
sound
and
their
solid
carapaces
are
harpoonproof
but
our
suckerfish
would
effect
their
capture
with
extraordinary
certainty
and
precision
in
truth
this
animal
is
a
living
fishhook
promising
wealth
and
happiness
to
the
greenest
fisherman
in
the
business
the
nautiluss
men
attached
to
each
fishs
tail
a
ring
that
was
big
enough
not
to
hamper
its
movements
and
to
this
ring
a
long
rope
whose
other
end
was
moored
on
board
thrown
into
the
sea
the
suckerfish
immediately
began
to
play
their
roles
going
and
fastening
themselves
onto
the
breastplates
of
the
turtles
their
tenacity
was
so
great
they
would
rip
apart
rather
than
let
go
they
were
hauled
in
still
sticking
to
the
turtles
that
came
aboard
with
them
in
this
way
we
caught
several
loggerheads
reptiles
a
meter
wide
and
weighing
200
kilos
theyre
extremely
valuable
because
of
their
carapaces
which
are
covered
with
big
slabs
of
horn
thin
brown
transparent
with
white
and
yellow
markings
besides
they
were
excellent
from
an
edible
viewpoint
with
an
exquisite
flavor
comparable
to
the
green
turtle
this
fishing
ended
our
stay
in
the
waterways
of
the
amazon
and
that
evening
the
nautilus
took
to
the
high
seas
once

the
devilfish
for
some
days
the
nautilus
kept
veering
away
from
the
american
coast
it
obviously
didnt
want
to
frequent
the
waves
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
or
the
caribbean
sea
yet
there
was
no
shortage
of
water
under
its
keel
since
the
average
depth
of
these
seas
is
1800
meters
but
these
waterways
strewn
with
islands
and
plowed
by
steamers
probably
didnt
agree
with
captain
nemo
on
april
16
we
raised
martinique
and
guadalupe
from
a
distance
of
about
thirty
miles
for
one
instant
i
could
see
their
lofty
peaks
the
canadian
was
quite
disheartened
having
counted
on
putting
his
plans
into
execution
in
the
gulf
either
by
reaching
shore
or
by
pulling
alongside
one
of
the
many
boats
plying
a
coastal
trade
from
one
island
to
another
an
escape
attempt
would
have
been
quite
feasible
assuming
ned
land
managed
to
seize
the
skiff
without
the
captains
knowledge
but
in
midocean
it
was
unthinkable
the
canadian
conseil
and
i
had
a
pretty
long
conversation
on
this
subject
for
six
months
we
had
been
prisoners
aboard
the
nautilus
we
had
fared
17000
leagues
and
as
ned
land
put
it
there
was
no
end
in
sight
so
he
made
me
a
proposition
i
hadnt
anticipated
we
were
to
ask
captain
nemo
this
question
straight
out
did
the
captain
mean
to
keep
us
on
board
his
vessel
permanently
this
measure
was
distasteful
to
me
to
my
mind
it
would
lead
nowhere
we
could
hope
for
nothing
from
the
nautiluss
commander
but
could
depend
only
on
ourselves
besides
for
some
time
now
the
man
had
been
gloomier
more
withdrawn
less
sociable
he
seemed
to
be
avoiding
me
i
encountered
him
only
at
rare
intervals
he
used
to
take
pleasure
in
explaining
the
underwater
wonders
to
me
now
he
left
me
to
my
research
and
no
longer
entered
the
lounge
what
changes
had
come
over
him
from
what
cause
i
had
no
reason
to
blame
myself
was
our
presence
on
board
perhaps
a
burden
to
him
even
so
i
cherished
no
hopes
that
the
man
would
set
us
free
so
i
begged
ned
to
let
me
think
about
it
before
taking
action
if
this
measure
proved
fruitless
it
could
arouse
the
captains
suspicions
make
our
circumstances
even
more
arduous
and
jeopardize
the
canadians
plans
i
might
add
that
i
could
hardly
use
our
state
of
health
as
an
argument
except
for
that
grueling
ordeal
under
the
ice
bank
at
the
south
pole
we
had
never
felt
better
neither
ned
conseil
nor
i
the
nutritious
food
lifegiving
air
regular
routine
and
uniform
temperature
kept
illness
at
bay
and
for
a
man
who
didnt
miss
his
past
existence
on
land
for
a
captain
nemo
who
was
at
home
here
who
went
where
he
wished
who
took
paths
mysterious
to
others
if
not
himself
in
attaining
his
ends
i
could
understand
such
a
life
but
we
ourselves
hadnt
severed
all
ties
with
humanity
for
my
part
i
didnt
want
my
new
and
unusual
research
to
be
buried
with
my
bones
i
had
now
earned
the
right
to
pen
the
definitive
book
on
the
sea
and
sooner
or
later
i
wanted
that
book
to
see
the
light
of
day
there
once
more
through
the
panels
opening
into
these
caribbean
waters
ten
meters
below
the
surface
of
the
waves
i
found
so
many
fascinating
exhibits
to
describe
in
my
daily
notes
among
other
zoophytes
there
were
portuguese
menofwar
known
by
the

like
big
oblong
bladders
with
a
pearly
sheen
spreading
their
membranes
to
the
wind
letting
their
blue
tentacles
drift
like
silken
threads
to
the
eye
delightful
jellyfish
to
the
touch
actual
nettles
that
ooze
a
corrosive
liquid
among
the
articulates
there
were
annelid
worms
one
and
a
half
meters
long
furnished
with
a
pink
proboscis
equipped
with
1700
organs
of
locomotion
snaking
through
the
waters
and
as
they
went
throwing
off
every
gleam
in
the
solar
spectrum
from
the
fish
branch
there
were
manta
rays
enormous
cartilaginous

ten
feet
long
and
weighing
600
pounds

pectoral

their

attached
to
the

of
the
face
at
the
front
of
the
head
they
floated
like
wreckage
from
a
ship
sometimes
fastening
onto
our
windows
like
opaque
shutters
there
were
american
triggerfish
for
which
nature
has
ground
only
black
and
white
pigments
feathershaped
gobies
that

with
short
sharp

covered
with

came
swarms
of

from

their
shining

with

on

how
many

we
had
risen
to
an
average
level
of
1500

the
nearest

was
the
island

of

scattered
like
a
batch
of
cobblestones
over
the
surface

there
high
underwater
cliffs
reared
up
straight

there
gaped
black

deep
our

couldnt

ned
and
i
were
naturally
led
into
mentioning
the
seas
gigantic
animals
the
former
were
obviously
meant
to
feed
the
latter
however
through
the
windows
of
our
almost
motionless
nautilus
i
could
see
nothing
among
these

than
the

was
about
eleven
oclock
when
ned

drew
my
attention
to
a
fearsome
commotion
out
in
this
huge
seaweed
well
i
said
these
are
real
devilfish
caverns

i
wouldnt

no
i

with
the

straightest

i

perfectly
seeing
a
large
boat
dragged
under
the
waves
by
the
arms
of
a
cephalopod
you

conseil
replied
in
a
church
the
canadian
exclaimed
yes
ned
my
friend
it
had
a
picture
that
portrayed
the
devilfish
in
question
oh
good
ned
land
exclaimed
with
a
burst
of
laughter
mr
conseil
put
one
over
on
me
actually
hes
right
i
said
ive
heard
about
that
picture
but
the
subject
it
portrays
is
taken
from
a
legend
and
you
know
how
to
rate
legends
in
matters
of
natural
history
besides
when
its
an
issue
of
monsters
the
human
imagination
always
tends
to
run
wild
people
not
only
claimed
these
devilfish
could
drag
ships
under
but
a
certain
olaus
magnus
tells
of
a
cephalopod
a
mile
long
that
looked
more
like
an
island
than
an
animal
theres
also
the
story
of
how
the
bishop
of
trondheim
set
up
an
altar
one
day
on
an
immense
rock
after
he
finished
saying
mass
this
rock
started
moving
and
went
back
into
the
sea
the
rock
was
a
devilfish
and
thats
everything
we
know
the
canadian
asked
no
i
replied
another
bishop
pontoppidan
of
bergen
also
tells
of
a
devilfish
so
large
a
whole
cavalry
regiment
could
maneuver
on
it
they
sure
did
go
on
those
oldtime
bishops
ned
land
said
finally
the
naturalists
of
antiquity
mention
some
monsters
with
mouths
as
big
as
a
gulf
which

work
men
the
canadian
put
in
but
in
all
these
stories
is
there
any
truth
conseil
asked
none
at
all
my
friends
at
least
in
those
that
go
beyond
the
bounds
of
credibility
and
fly
off
into
fable
or
legend
yet
for
the
imaginings
of
these
storytellers
there
had
to
be
if
not
a
cause
at
least
an
excuse
it
cant
be
denied
that
some
species
of
squid
and
other
devilfish
are
quite
large
though
still
smaller
than
cetaceans
aristotle
put
the
dimensions
of
one
squid
at
five
cubits
or
31
meters
our
fishermen
frequently
see
specimens
over
18
meters
long
the
museums
in
trieste
and
montpellier
have
preserved
some
devilfish
carcasses
measuring
two
meters
besides
according
to
the
calculations
of
naturalists
one
of
these
animals
only
six
feet
long
would
have
tentacles
as
long
as
twentyseven
which
is
enough
to
make
a
fearsome
monster
does
anybody
fish
for
em
nowadays
the
canadian
asked
if
they
dont
fish
for
them
sailors
at
least
sight
them
a
friend
of
mine
captain
paul
bos
of
le
havre
has
often
sworn
to
me
that
he
encountered
one
of
these
monsters
of
colossal
size
in
the
seas
of
the
east
indies
but
the
most
astonishing
event
which
proves
that
these
gigantic
animals
undeniably
exist
took
place
a
few
years
ago
in
1861
what
event
was
that
ned
land
asked
just
this
in
1861
to
the
northeast
of
tenerife
and
fairly
near
the
latitude
where
we
are
right
now
the
crew
of
the
gunboat
alecto
spotted
a
monstrous
squid
swimming
in
their
waters
commander
bouguer
approached
the
animal
and
attacked
it
with
blows
from
harpoons
and
blasts
from
rifles
but
without
much
success
because
bullets
and
harpoons
crossed
its
soft
flesh
as
if
it
were
semiliquid
jelly
after
several
fruitless
attempts
the
crew
managed
to
slip
a
noose
around
the
mollusks
body
this
noose
slid
as
far
as
the
caudal
fins
and
came
to
a
halt
then
they
tried
to
haul
the
monster
on
board
but
its
weight
was
so
considerable
that
when
they
tugged
on
the
rope
the
animal
parted
company
with
its
tail
and
deprived
of
this
adornment
it
disappeared
beneath
the
waters
finally
an
actual
event
ned
land
said
an
indisputable
event
my
gallant
ned
accordingly
people
have
proposed
naming
this
devilfish
bouguers
squid
and
how
long
was
it
the
canadian
asked
didnt
it
measure
about
six
meters
said
conseil
who
was
stationed
at
the
window
and
examining
anew
the
crevices
in
the
cliff
precisely
i
replied
wasnt
its
head
conseil
went
on
crowned
by
eight
tentacles
that
quivered
in
the
water
like
a
nest
of
snakes
precisely
werent
its
eyes
prominently
placed
and
considerably
enlarged
yes
conseil
and
wasnt
its
mouth
a
real
parrots
beak
but
of
fearsome
size
correct
conseil
well
with
all
due
respect
to
master
conseil
replied
serenely
if
this
isnt
bouguers
squid
its
at
least
one
of
his
close
relatives
i
stared
at
conseil
ned
land
rushed
to
the
window
what
an
awful
animal
he
exclaimed
i
stared
in
my
turn
and
couldnt
keep
back
a
movement
of
revulsion
before
my
eyes
there
quivered
a
horrible
monster
worthy
of
a
place
among
the
most
farfetched
teratological
legends
it
was
a
squid
of
colossal
dimensions
fully
eight
meters
long
it
was
traveling
backward
with
tremendous
speed
in
the
same
direction
as
the
nautilus
it
gazed
with
enormous
staring
eyes
that
were
tinted
sea
green
its
eight
arms
or
more
accurately
feet
were
rooted
in
its
head
which
has
earned
these
animals
the
name
cephalopod
its
arms
stretched
a
distance
twice
the
length
of
its
body
and
were
writhing
like
the
serpentine
hair
of
the
furies
you
could
plainly
see
its
250
suckers
arranged
over
the
inner
sides
of
its
tentacles
and
shaped
like
semispheric
capsules
sometimes
these
suckers
fastened
onto
the
lounge
window
by
creating
vacuums
against
it
the
monsters
moutha
beak
made
of
horn
and
shaped
like
that
of
a
parrotopened
and
closed
vertically
its
tongue
also
of
horn
substance
and
armed
with
several
rows
of
sharp
teeth
would
flicker
out
from
between
these
genuine
shears
what
a
freak
of
nature
a
birds
beak
on
a
mollusk
its
body
was
spindleshaped
and
swollen
in
the
middle
a
fleshy
mass
that
must
have
weighed
20000
to
25000
kilograms
its
unstable
color
would
change
with
tremendous
speed
as
the
animal
grew
irritated
passing
successively
from
bluish
gray
to
reddish
brown
what
was
irritating
this
mollusk
no
doubt
the
presence
of
the
nautilus
even
more
fearsome
than
itself
and
which
it
couldnt
grip
with
its
mandibles
or
the
suckers
on
its
arms
and
yet
what
monsters
these
devilfish
are
what
vitality
our
creator
has
given
them
what
vigor
in
their
movements
thanks
to
their
owning
a
triple
heart
sheer
chance
had
placed
us
in
the
presence
of
this
squid
and
i
didnt
want
to
lose
this
opportunity
to
meticulously
study
such
a
cephalopod
specimen
i
overcame
the
horror
that
its
appearance
inspired
in
me
picked
up
a
pencil
and
began
to
sketch
it
perhaps
this
is
the
same
as
the
alectos
conseil
said
cant
be
the
canadian
replied
because
this
ones
complete
while
the
other
one
lost
its
tail
that
doesnt
necessarily
follow
i
said
the
arms
and
tails
of
these
animals
grow
back
through
regeneration
and
in
seven
years
the
tail
on
bouguers
squid
has
surely
had
time
to
sprout
again
anyhow
ned
shot
back
if
it
isnt
this
fellow
maybe
its
one
of
those
indeed
other
devilfish
had
appeared
at
the
starboard
window
i
counted
seven
of
them
they
provided
the
nautilus
with
an
escort
and
i
could
hear
their
beaks
gnashing
on
the
sheetiron
hull
we
couldnt
have
asked
for
a
more
devoted
following
i
continued
sketching
these
monsters
kept
pace
in
our
waters
with
such
precision
they
seemed
to
be
standing
still
and
i
could
have
traced
their
outlines
in
miniature
on
the
window
but
we
were
moving
at
a
moderate
speed
all
at
once
the
nautilus
stopped
a
jolt
made
it
tremble
through
its
entire
framework
did
we
strike
bottom
i
asked
in
any
event
were
already
clear
the
canadian
replied
because
were
afloat
the
nautilus
was
certainly
afloat
but
it
was
no
longer
in
motion
the
blades
of
its
propeller
werent
churning
the
waves
a
minute
passed
followed
by
his
chief
officer
captain
nemo
entered
the
lounge
i
hadnt
seen
him
for
a
good
while
he
looked
gloomy
to
me
without
speaking
to
us
without
even
seeing
us
perhaps
he
went
to
the
panel
stared
at
the
devilfish
and
said
a
few
words
to
his
chief
officer
the
latter
went
out
soon
the
panels
closed
the
ceiling
lit
up
i
went
over
to
the
captain
an
unusual
assortment
of
devilfish
i
told
him
as
carefree
as
a
collector
in
front
of
an
aquarium
correct
mr
naturalist
he
answered
me
and
were
going
to
fight
them
at
close
quarters
i
gaped
at
the
captain
i
thought
my
hearing
had
gone
bad
at
close
quarters
i
repeated
yes
sir
our
propeller
is
jammed
i
think
the
horncovered
mandibles
of
one
of
these
squid
are
entangled
in
the
blades
thats
why
we
arent
moving
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
rise
to
the
surface
and
slaughter
the
vermin
a
difficult
undertaking
correct
our
electric
bullets
are
ineffective
against
such
soft
flesh
where
they
dont
meet
enough
resistance
to
go
off
but
well
attack
the
beasts
with
axes
and
harpoons
sir
the
canadian
said
if
you
dont
turn
down
my
help
i
accept
it
mr
land
well
go
with
you
i
said
and
we
followed
captain
nemo
heading
to
the
central
companionway
there
some
ten
men
were
standing
by
for
the
assault
armed
with
boarding
axes
conseil
and
i
picked
up
two
more
axes
ned
land
seized
a
harpoon
by
then
the
nautilus
had
returned
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
stationed
on
the
top
steps
one
of
the
seamen
undid
the
bolts
of
the
hatch
but
he
had
scarcely
unscrewed
the
nuts
when
the
hatch
flew
up
with
tremendous
violence
obviously
pulled
open
by
the
suckers
on
a
devilfishs
arm
instantly
one
of
those
long
arms
glided
like
a
snake
into
the
opening
and
twenty
others
were
quivering
above
with
a
sweep
of
the
ax
captain
nemo
chopped
off
this
fearsome
tentacle
which
slid
writhing
down
the
steps
just
as
we
were
crowding
each
other
to
reach
the
platform
two
more
arms
lashed
the
air
swooped
on
the
seaman
stationed
in
front
of
captain
nemo
and
carried
the
fellow
away
with
irresistible
violence
captain
nemo
gave
a
shout
and
leaped
outside
we
rushed
after
him
what
a
scene
seized
by
the
tentacle
and
glued
to
its
suckers
the
unfortunate
man
was
swinging
in
the
air
at
the
mercy
of
this
enormous
appendage
he
gasped
he
choked
he
yelled
help
help
these
words
pronounced
in
french
left
me
deeply
stunned
so
i
had
a
fellow
countryman
on
board
perhaps
several
ill
hear
his
harrowing
plea
the
rest
of
my
life
the
poor
fellow
was
done
for
who
could
tear
him
from
such
a
powerful
grip
even
so
captain
nemo
rushed
at
the
devilfish
and
with
a
sweep
of
the
ax
hewed
one
more
of
its
arms
his
chief
officer
struggled
furiously
with
other
monsters
crawling
up
the
nautiluss
sides
the
crew
battled
with
flailing
axes
the
canadian
conseil
and
i
sank
our
weapons
into
these
fleshy
masses
an
intense
musky
odor
filled
the
air
it
was
horrible
for
an
instant
i
thought
the
poor
man
entwined
by
the
devilfish
might
be
torn
loose
from
its
powerful
suction
seven
arms
out
of
eight
had
been
chopped
off
brandishing
its
victim
like
a
feather
one
lone
tentacle
was
writhing
in
the
air
but
just
as
captain
nemo
and
his
chief
officer
rushed
at
it
the
animal
shot
off
a
spout
of
blackish
liquid
secreted
by
a
pouch
located
in
its
abdomen
it
blinded
us
when
this
cloud
had
dispersed
the
squid
was
gone
and
so
was
my
poor
fellow
countryman
what
rage
then
drove
us
against
these
monsters
we
lost
all
selfcontrol
ten
or
twelve
devilfish
had
overrun
the
nautiluss
platform
and
sides
we
piled
helterskelter
into
the
thick
of
these
sawedoff
snakes
which
darted
over
the
platform
amid
waves
of
blood
and
sepia
ink
it
seemed
as
if
these
viscous
tentacles
grew
back
like
the
many
heads
of
hydra
at
every
thrust
ned
lands
harpoon
would
plunge
into
a
squids
seagreen
eye
and
burst
it
but
my
daring
companion
was
suddenly
toppled
by
the
tentacles
of
a
monster
he
could
not
avoid
oh
my
heart
nearly
exploded
with
excitement
and
horror
the
squids
fearsome
beak
was
wide
open
over
ned
land
the
poor
man
was
about
to
be
cut
in
half
i
ran
to
his
rescue
but
captain
nemo
got
there
first
his
ax
disappeared
between
the
two
enormous
mandibles
and
the
canadian
miraculously
saved
stood
and
plunged
his
harpoon
all
the
way
into
the
devilfishs
triple
heart
tit
for
tat
captain
nemo
told
the
canadian
i
owed
it
to
myself
ned
bowed
without
answering
him
this
struggle
had
lasted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
defeated
mutilated
battered
to
death
the
monsters
finally
yielded
to
us
and
disappeared
beneath
the
waves
red
with
blood
motionless
by
the
beacon
captain
nemo
stared
at
the
sea
that
had
swallowed
one
of
his
companions
and
large
tears
streamed
from
his
eyes

this
dreadful
scene
on

none
of
us
will
ever
be
able
to
forget
i
wrote
it
up
in
a
state
of
intense
excitement
later
i
reviewed
my
narrative
i
read
it
to
conseil
and
the
canadian
they
found
it
accurate
in
detail
but
deficient
in
impact
to
convey
such
sights
it
would
take
the
pen
of
our
most
famous
poet
victor
hugo
author
of
the
toilers
of
the
sea
as
i
said
captain
nemo
wept
while
staring
at
the
waves
his
grief
was
immense
this
was
the
second
companion
he
had
lost
since
we
had
come
aboard
and
what
a
way
to
die
smashed
strangled
crushed
by
the
fearsome
arms
of
a
devilfish
ground
between
its
iron
mandibles
this
friend
would
never
rest
with
his
companions
in
the
placid
waters
of
their
coral
cemetery
as
for
me
what
had
harrowed
my
heart
in
the
thick
of
this
struggle
was
the
despairing
yell
given
by
this
unfortunate
man
forgetting
his
regulation
language
this
poor
frenchman
had
reverted
to
speaking
his
own
mother
tongue
to
fling
out
one
supreme
plea
among
the
nautiluss
crew
allied
body
and
soul
with
captain
nemo
and
likewise
fleeing
from
human
contact
i
had
found
a
fellow
countryman
was
he
the
only
representative
of
france
in
this
mysterious
alliance
obviously
made
up
of
individuals
from
different
nationalities
this
was
just
one
more
of
those
insoluble
problems
that
kept
welling
up
in
my
mind
captain
nemo
reentered
his
stateroom
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
for
a
good
while
but
how
sad
despairing
and
irresolute
he
must
have
felt
to
judge
from
this
ship
whose
soul
he
was
which
reflected
his
every
mood
the
nautilus
no
longer
kept
to
a
fixed
heading
it
drifted
back
and
forth
riding
with
the
waves
like
a
corpse
its
propeller
had
been
disentangled
but
was
barely
put
to
use
it
was
navigating
at
random
it
couldnt
tear
itself
away
from
the
setting
of
this
last
struggle
from
this
sea
that
had
devoured
one
of
its
own
ten
days
went
by
in
this
way
it
was
only
on
may
1
that
the
nautilus
openly
resumed
its
northbound
course
after
raising
the
bahamas
at
the
mouth
of
old
bahama
channel
we
then
went
with
the
current
of
the
seas
greatest
river
which
has
its
own
banks
fish
and
temperature
i
mean
the
gulf
stream
it
is
indeed
a
river
that
runs
independently
through
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
its
waters
never
mixing
with
the
oceans
waters
its
a
salty
river
saltier
than
the
sea
surrounding
it
its
average
depth
is
3000
feet
its
average
width
sixty
miles
in
certain
localities
its
current
moves
at
a
speed
of
four
kilometers
per
hour
the
unchanging
volume
of
its
waters
is
greater
than
that
of
all
the
worlds
rivers
combined
as
discovered
by
commander
maury
the
true
source
of
the
gulf
stream
its
starting
point
if
you
prefer
is
located
in
the
bay
of
biscay
there
its
waters
still
weak
in
temperature
and
color
begin
to
form

into
two
branches
one
going
to
the

for
further
saturation

then
entrusted
with
restoring
the
balance
between
hot
and
cold
temperatures
and
with
mixing
tropical
and
northern
waters
the
gulf
stream
begins
to
play
its
stabilizing
role
attaining
a
white
heat
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
heads
north
up
the
american
coast
advances
as
far
as
newfoundland
swerves
away
under
the
thrust
of
a
cold
current
from
the
davis
strait
and
resumes
its
ocean
course
by
going
along
a
great
circle
of
the
earth
on
a
rhumb
line
it
then
divides
into
two
arms
near
the
43rd
parallel

helped
by
the
northeast

where
its
temperature
falls
to
4
degrees
centigrade
and
fashions
the
open
sea
at
the
pole
it
was
on
this
oceanic
river
that
the
nautilus
was
then
navigating
leaving
old
bahama
channel
which
is
fourteen
leagues
wide
by
350
meters
deep
the
gulf
stream
moves
at
the
rate
of
eight
kilometers
per
hour
its
speed
steadily
decreases
as
it
advances
northward
and
we
must
pray
that
this
steadiness
continues
because
as
experts
agree
if
its
speed
and
direction
were
to
change
the
climates
of
europe
would
undergo
disturbances
whose
consequences
are
incalculable
near
noon
i
was
on
the
platform
with
conseil
i
shared
with
him
the
relevant
details
on
the
gulf
stream
when
my
explanation
was
over
i
invited
him
to
dip
his
hands
into
its
current
conseil
did
so
and
he
was
quite
astonished
to
experience
no
sensation
of
either
hot
or
cold
that
comes
i
told
him
from
the
water
temperature
of
the
gulf
stream
which
as
it
leaves
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
barely
different
from
your
blood
temperature
this
gulf
stream
is
a
huge
heat
generator
that
enables
the
coasts
of
europe
to
be
decked
in
eternal
greenery
and
if
commander
maury
is
correct
were
one
to
harness
the
full
warmth
of
this
current
it
would
supply
enough
heat
to
keep
molten
a
river
of
iron
solder
as
big
as
the
amazon
or
the
missouri
just
then
the
gulf
streams
speed
was
225
meters
per
second
so
distinct
is
its
current
from
the
surrounding
sea
its
confined
waters
stand
out
against
the
ocean
and
operate
on
a
different
level
from
the
colder
waters
murky
as
well
and
very
rich
in
saline
material
their
pure
indigo
contrasts
with
the
green
waves
surrounding
them
moreover
their
line
of
demarcation
is
so
clear
that
abreast
of
the
carolinas
the
nautiluss
spur
cut
the
waves
of
the
gulf
stream
while
its
propeller
was
still
churning
those
belonging
to
the
ocean
this
current
swept
along
with
it
a
whole
host
of
moving
creatures
argonauts
so
common
in
the
mediterranean
voyaged
here
in
schools
of
large
numbers
among
cartilaginous
fish
the
most
remarkable
were
rays
whose
ultra
slender
tails
made
up
nearly
a
third
of
the
body
which
was
shaped
like
a
huge
diamond
twentyfive
feet
long
then
little
onemeter
sharks
the
head
large
the
snout
short
and
rounded
the
teeth
sharp
and
arranged
in
several
rows
the
body
seemingly
covered
with
scales
among
bony
fish
i
noted
grizzled
wrasse
unique
to
these
seas
deepwater
gilthead
whose
iris
has
a
fiery
gleam
onemeter
croakers
whose
large
mouths
bristle
with
small
teeth
and
which
let
out
thin
cries
black
rudderfish
like
those
ive
already
discussed
blue
dorados
accented
with
gold
and
silver
rainbowhued
parrotfish
that
can
rival
the
loveliest
tropical

in
coloring
banded
blennies
with
triangular

bluish
flounder
without

various
specimens
of

dedicated
to

finally
the

a
handsome

decorated
by
every
honorary
order
bedizened
with
their
every

frequenting
the
shores
of
this
great
nation
where
ribbons
and
orders
are
held
in
such
low
esteem
i
might
add
that
during
the
night
the
gulf
streams
phosphorescent
waters
rivaled
the
electric
glow
of
our
beacon
especially
in
the
stormy
weather
that
frequently
threatened
us
on
may
8
while
abreast
of
north
carolina
we
were
across
from
cape
hatteras
once
more
there
the
gulf
stream
is
seventyfive
miles
wide
and
210
meters
deep
the
nautilus
continued
to
wander
at
random
seemingly
all
supervision
had
been
jettisoned
under
these
conditions
i
admit
that
we
could
easily
have
gotten
away
in
fact
the
populous
shores
offered
ready
refuge
everywhere
the
sea
was
plowed
continuously
by
the
many
steamers
providing
service
between
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
new
york
or
boston
and
it
was
crossed
night
and
day
by
little
schooners
engaged
in
coastal
trade
over
various
points
on
the
american
shore
we
could
hope
to
be
picked
up
so
it
was
a
promising
opportunity
despite
the
thirty
miles
that
separated
the
nautilus
from
these
union
coasts
but
one
distressing
circumstance
totally
thwarted
the
canadians
plans
the
weather
was
thoroughly
foul
we
were
approaching
waterways
where
storms
are
commonplace
the
very
homeland
of
tornadoes
and
cyclones
specifically
engendered
by
the
gulf
streams
current
to
face
a
frequently
raging
sea
in
a
frail
skiff
was
a
race
to
certain
disaster
ned
land
conceded
this
himself
so
he
champed
at
the
bit
in
the
grip
of
an
intense
homesickness
that
could
be
cured
only
by
our
escape
sir
he
told
me
that
day
its
got
to
stop
i
want
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
your
nemos
veering
away
from
shore
and
heading
up
north
but
believe
you
me
i
had
my
fill
at
the
south
pole
and
im
not
going
with
him
to
the
north
pole
what
can
we
do
ned
since
it
isnt
feasible
to
escape
right
now
i
keep
coming
back
to
my
idea
weve
got
to
talk
to
the
captain
when
we
were
in
your
own
countrys
seas
you
didnt
say
a
word
now
that
were
in
mine
i
intend
to
speak
up
before
a
few
days
are
out
i
figure
the
nautilus
will
lie
abreast
of
nova
scotia
and
from
there
to
newfoundland
is
the
mouth
of
a
large
gulf
and
the
st
lawrence
empties
into
that
gulf
and
the
st
lawrence
is
my
own
river
the
river
running
by
quebec
my
hometownand
when
i
think
about
all
this
my
gorge
rises
and
my
hair
stands
on
end
honestly
sir
id
rather
jump
overboard
i
cant
stay
here
any
longer
im
suffocating
the
canadian
was
obviously
at
the
end
of
his
patience
his
vigorous
nature
couldnt
adapt
to
this
protracted
imprisonment
his
facial
appearance
was
changing
by
the
day
his
moods
grew
gloomier
and
gloomier
i
had
a
sense
of
what
he
was
suffering
because
i
also
was
gripped
by
homesickness
nearly
seven
months
had
gone
by
without
our
having
any
news
from
shore
moreover
captain
nemos
reclusiveness
his
changed
disposition
and
especially
his
total
silence
since
the
battle
with
the
devilfish
all
made
me
see
things
in
a
different
light
i
no
longer
felt
the
enthusiasm
of
our
first
days
on
board
you
needed
to
be
flemish
like
conseil
to
accept
these
circumstances
living
in
a
habitat
designed
for
cetaceans
and
other
denizens
of
the
deep
truly
if
that
gallant
lad
had
owned
gills
instead
of
lungs
i
think
he
would
have
made
an
outstanding
fish
well
sir
ned
land
went
on
seeing
that
i
hadnt
replied
well
ned
you
want
me
to
ask
captain
nemo
what
he
intends
to
do
with
us
yes
sir
even
though
he
has
already
made
that
clear
yes
i
want
it
settled
once
and
for
all
speak
just
for
me
strictly
on
my
behalf
if
you
want
but
i
rarely
encounter
him
he
positively
avoids
me
all
the
more
reason
you
should
go
look
him
up
ill
confer
with
him
ned
when
the
canadian
asked
insistently
when
i
encounter
him
professor
aronnax
would
you
like
me
to
go
find
him
myself
no
let
me
do
it
tomorrow
today
ned
land
said
so
be
it
ill
see
him
today
i
answered
the
canadian
who
if
he
took
action
himself
would
certainly
have
ruined
everything
i
was
left
to
myself
his
request
granted
i
decided
to
dispose
of
it
immediately
i
like
things
over
and
done
with
i
reentered
my
stateroom
from
there
i
could
hear
movements
inside
captain
nemos
quarters
i
couldnt
pass
up
this
chance
for
an
encounter
i
knocked
on
his
door
i
received
no
reply
i
knocked
again
then
tried
the
knob
the
door
opened
i
entered
the
captain
was
there
he
was
bending
over
his
worktable
and
hadnt
heard
me
determined
not
to
leave
without
questioning
him
i
drew
closer
he
looked
up
sharply
with
a
frowning
brow
and
said
in
a
pretty
stern
tone
oh
its
you
what
do
you
want
to
speak
with
you
captain
but
im
busy
sir
im
at
work
i
give
you
the
freedom
to
enjoy
your
privacy
cant
i
have
the
same
for
myself
this
reception
was
less
than
encouraging
but
i
was
determined
to
give
as
good
as
i
got
sir
i
said
coolly
i
need
to
speak
with
you
on
a
matter
that
simply
cant
wait
whatever
could
that
be
sir
he
replied
sarcastically
have
you
made
some
discovery
that
has
escaped
me
has
the
sea
yielded
up
some
novel
secret
to
you
we
were
miles
apart
but
before
i
could
reply
he
showed
me
a
manuscript
open
on
the
table
and
told
me
in
a
more
serious
tone
here
professor
aronnax
is
a
manuscript
written
in
several
languages
it
contains
a
summary
of
my
research
under
the
sea
and
god
willing
it
wont
perish
with
me
signed
with
my
name
complete
with
my
life
story
this
manuscript
will
be
enclosed
in
a
small
unsinkable
contrivance
the
last
surviving
man
on
the
nautilus
will
throw
this
contrivance
into
the
sea
and
it
will
go
wherever
the
waves
carry
it
the
mans
name
his
life
story
written
by
himself
so
the
secret
of
his
existence
might
someday
be
unveiled
but
just
then
i
saw
this
announcement
only
as
a
leadin
to
my
topic
captain
i
replied
im
all
praise
for
this
idea
youre
putting
into
effect
the
fruits
of
your
research
must
not
be
lost
but
the
methods
youre
using
strike
me
as
primitive
who
knows
where
the
winds
will
take
that
contrivance
into
whose
hands
it
may
fall
cant
you
find
something
better
cant
you
or
one
of
your
men
never
sir
the
captain
said
swiftly
interrupting
me
but
my
companions
and
i
would
be
willing
to
safeguard
this
manuscript
and
if
you
give
us
back
our
freedom
your
freedom
captain
nemo
put
in
standing
up
yes
sir
and
thats
the
subject
on
which
i
wanted
to
confer
with
you
for
seven
months
weve
been
aboard
your
vessel
and
i
ask
you
today
in
the
name
of
my
companions
as
well
as
myself
if
you
intend
to
keep
us
here
forever
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
said
ill
answer
you
today
just
as
i
did
seven
months
ago
whoever
boards
the
nautilus
must
never
leave
it
what
youre
inflicting
on
us
is
outright
slavery
call
it
anything
you
like
but
every
slave
has
the
right
to
recover
his
freedom
by
any
worthwhile
available
means
who
has
denied
you
that
right
captain
nemo
replied
did
i
ever
try
to
bind
you
with
your
word
of
honor
the
captain
stared
at
me
crossing
his
arms
sir
i
told
him
to
take
up
this
subject
a
second
time
would
be
distasteful
to
both
of
us
so
lets
finish
what
weve
started
i
repeat
it
isnt
just
for
myself
that
i
raise
this
issue
to
me
research
is
a
relief
a
potent
diversion
an
enticement
a
passion
that
can
make
me
forget
everything
else
like
you
im
a
man
neglected
and
unknown
living
in
the
faint
hope
that
someday
i
can
pass
on
to
future
generations
the
fruits
of
my
laborsfiguratively
speaking
by
means
of
some
contrivance
left
to
the
luck
of
winds
and
waves
in
short
i
can
admire
you
and
comfortably
go
with
you
while
playing
a
role
i
only
partly
understand
but
i
still
catch
glimpses
of
other
aspects
of
your
life
that
are
surrounded
by
involvements
and
secrets
that
alone
on
board
my
companions
and
i
cant
share
and
even
when
our
hearts
could
beat
with
yours
moved
by
some
of
your
griefs
or
stirred
by
your
deeds
of
courage
and
genius
weve
had
to
stifle
even
the
slightest
token
of
that
sympathy
that
arises
at
the
sight
of
something
fine
and
good
whether
it
comes
from
friend
or
enemy
all
right
then
its
this
feeling
of
being
alien
to
your
deepest
concerns
that
makes
our
situation
unacceptable
impossible
even
impossible
for
me
but
especially
for
ned
land
every
man
by
virtue
of
his
very
humanity
deserves
fair
treatment
have
you
considered
how
a
love
of
freedom
and
hatred
of
slavery
could
lead
to
plans
of
vengeance
in
a
temperament
like
the
canadians
what
he
might
think
attempt
endeavor




i
fell
silent
captain
nemo
stood
up
ned
land
can
think
attempt
or
endeavor
anything
he
wants
what
difference
is
it
to
me
i
didnt
go
looking
for
him
i
dont
keep
him
on
board
for
my
pleasure
as
for
you
professor
aronnax
youre
a
man
able
to
understand
anything
even
silence
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
let
this
first
time
youve
come
to
discuss
this
subject
also
be
the
last
because
a
second
time
i
wont
even
listen
i
withdrew
from
that
day
forward
our
position
was
very
strained
i
reported
this
conversation
to
my
two
companions
now
we
know
ned
said
that
we
cant
expect
a
thing
from
this
man
the
nautilus
is
nearing
long
island
well
escape
no
matter
what
the
weather
but
the
skies
became
more
and
more
threatening
there
were
conspicuous
signs
of
a
hurricane
on
the
way
the
atmosphere
was
turning
white
and
milky
slender
sheaves
of
cirrus
clouds
were
followed
on
the
horizon
by
layers
of
nimbocumulus
other
low
clouds
fled
swiftly
the
sea
grew
towering
inflated
by
long
swells
every
bird
had
disappeared
except
a
few
petrels
friends
of
the
storms
the
barometer
fell
significantly
indicating
a
tremendous
tension
in
the
surrounding
haze
the
mixture
in
our
stormglass
decomposed
under
the
influence
of
the
electricity
charging
the
air
a
struggle
of
the
elements
was
approaching
the
storm
burst
during
the
daytime
of
may
13
just
as
the
nautilus
was
cruising
abreast
of
long
island
a
few
miles
from
the
narrows
to
upper
new
york
bay
im
able
to
describe
this
struggle
of
the
elements
because
captain
nemo
didnt
flee
into
the
ocean
depths
instead
from
some
inexplicable
whim
he
decided
to
brave
it
out
on
the
surface
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
southwest
initially
a
stiff
breeze
in
other
words
with
a
speed
of
fifteen
meters
per
second
which
built
to
twentyfive
meters
near
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
this
is
the
figure
for
major
storms
unshaken
by
these
squalls
captain
nemo
stationed
himself
on
the
platform
he
was
lashed
around
the
waist
to
withstand
the
monstrous
breakers
foaming
over
the
deck
i
hoisted
and
attached
myself
to
the
same
place
dividing
my
wonderment
between
the
storm
and
this
incomparable
man
who
faced
it
headon
the
raging
sea
was
swept
with
huge
tattered
clouds
drenched
by
the
waves
i
saw
no
more
of
the
small
intervening
billows
that
form
in
the
troughs
of
the
big
crests
just
long
sootcolored
undulations
with
crests
so
compact
they
didnt
foam
they
kept
growing
taller
they
were
spurring
each
other
on
the
nautilus
sometimes
lying
on
its
side
sometimes
standing
on
end
like
a
mast
rolled
and
pitched
frightfully
near
five
oclock
a
torrential
rain
fell
but
it
lulled
neither
wind
nor
sea
the
hurricane
was
unleashed
at
a
speed
of
fortyfive
meters
per
second
hence
almost
forty
leagues
per
hour
under
these
conditions
houses
topple
roof
tiles
puncture
doors
iron
railings
snap
in
two
and
twentyfourpounder
cannons
relocate
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
this
turmoil
the
nautilus
lived
up
to
that
saying
of
an
expert
engineer
a
wellconstructed
hull
can
defy
any
sea
this
submersible
was
no
resisting
rock
that
waves
could
demolish
it
was
a
steel
spindle
obediently
in
motion
without
rigging
or
masting
and
able
to
brave
their
fury
with
impunity
meanwhile
i
was
carefully
examining
these
unleashed
breakers
they
measured
up
to
fifteen
meters
in
height
over
a
length
of
150
to
175
meters
and
the
speed
of
their
propagation
half
that
of
the
wind
was
fifteen
meters
per
second
their
volume
and
power
increased
with
the
depth
of
the
waters
i
then
understood
the
role
played
by
these
waves
which
trap
air
in
their
flanks
and
release
it
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
where
its
oxygen
brings
life
their
utmost
pressureit
has
been
calculatedcan
build
to
3000
kilograms
on
every
square
foot
of
surface
they
strike
it
was
such
waves
in
the
hebrides
that
repositioned
a
stone
block
weighing
84000
pounds
it
was
their
relatives
in
the
tidal
wave
on
december
23
1854
that
toppled
part
of
the
japanese
city
of
tokyo
then
went
that
same
day
at
700
kilometers
per
hour
to
break
on
the
beaches
of
america
after
nightfall
the
storm
grew
in
intensity
as
in
the
1860
cyclone
on
runion
island
the
barometer
fell
to
710
millimeters
at
the
close
of
day
i
saw
a
big
ship
passing
on
the
horizon
struggling
painfully
it
lay
to
at
half
steam
in
an
effort
to
hold
steady
on
the
waves
it
must
have
been
a
steamer
on
one
of
those
lines
out
of
new
york
to
liverpool
or
le
havre
it
soon
vanished
into
the
shadows
at
ten
oclock
in
the
evening
the
skies
caught
on
fire
the
air
was
streaked
with
violent
flashes
of
lightning
i
couldnt
stand
this
brightness
but
captain
nemo
stared
straight
at
it
as
if
to
inhale
the
spirit
of
the
storm
a
dreadful
noise
filled
the
air
a
complicated
noise
made
up
of
the
roar
of
crashing
breakers
the
howl
of
the
wind
claps
of
thunder
the
wind
shifted
to
every
point
of
the
horizon
and
the
cyclone
left
the
east
to
return
there
after
passing
through
north
west
and
south
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
of
revolving
storms
in
the
southern
hemisphere
oh
that
gulf
stream
it
truly
lives
up
to
its
nickname
the
lord
of
storms
all
by
itself
it
creates
these
fearsome
cyclones
through
the
difference
in
temperature
between
its
currents
and
the
superimposed
layers
of
air
the
rain
was
followed
by
a
downpour
of
fire
droplets
of
water
changed
into
exploding
tufts
you
would
have
thought
captain
nemo
was
courting
a
death
worthy
of
himself
seeking
to
be
struck
by
lightning
in
one
hideous
pitching
movement
the
nautilus
reared
its
steel
spur
into
the
air
like
a
lightning
rod
and
i
saw
long
sparks
shoot
down
it
shattered
at
the
end
of
my
strength
i
slid
flat
on
my
belly
to
the
hatch
i
opened
it
and
went
below
to
the
lounge
by
then
the
storm
had
reached
its
maximum
intensity
it
was
impossible
to
stand
upright
inside
the
nautilus
captain
nemo
reentered
near
midnight
i
could
hear
the
ballast
tanks
filling
little
by
little
and
the
nautilus
sank
gently
beneath
the
surface
of
the
waves
through
the
lounges
open
windows
i
saw
large
frightened
fish
passing
like
phantoms
in
the
fiery
waters
some
were
struck
by
lightning
right
before
my
eyes
the
nautilus
kept
descending
i
thought
it
would
find
calm
again
at
fifteen
meters
down
no
the
upper
strata
were
too
violently
agitated
it
needed
to
sink
to
fifty
meters
searching
for
a
resting
place
in
the
bowels
of
the
sea
but
once
there
what
tranquility
we
found
what
silence
what
peace
all
around
us
who
would
have
known
that
a
dreadful
hurricane
was
then
unleashed
on
the
surface
of
this
ocean
chapter

in
latitude

and
longitude

in
the
aftermath
of
this
storm
we
were
thrown
back
to
the
east
away
went
any
hope
of
escaping
to
the
landing
places
of
new
york
or
the
st
lawrence
in
despair
poor
ned
went
into
seclusion
like
captain
nemo
conseil
and
i
no
longer
left
each
other
as
i
said
the
nautilus
veered
to
the
east
to
be
more
accurate
i
should
have
said
to
the
northeast
sometimes
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
sometimes
beneath
them
the
ship
wandered
for
days
amid
these
mists
so
feared
by
navigators
these
are
caused
chiefly
by
melting
ice
which
keeps
the
air
extremely
damp
how
many
ships
have
perished
in
these
waterways
as
they
tried
to
get
directions
from
the
hazy
lights
on
the
coast
how
many
casualties
have
been
caused
by
these
opaque
mists
how
many
collisions
have
occurred
with
these
reefs
where
the
breaking
surf
is
covered
by
the
noise
of
the
wind
how
many
vessels
have
rammed
each
other
despite
their
running
lights
despite
the
warnings
given
by
their
bosuns
pipes
and
alarm
bells
so
the
floor
of
this
sea
had
the
appearance
of
a
battlefield
where
every
ship
defeated
by
the
ocean
still
lay
some
already
old
and
encrusted
others
newer
and
reflecting
our
beacon
light
on
their
ironwork
and
copper
undersides
among
these
vessels
how
many
went
down
with
all
hands

we
were
off
the
southern
tip
of
the
grand
banks
of
newfoundland
these
banks
are
the
result
of
marine
sedimentation
an
extensive
accumulation
of
organic
waste
brought
either
from
the
equator
by
the
gulf

current
or
from
the
north
pole
by
the

the

no
great
depth
at
the
grand

a
few
hundred

at
best

to
the

there
is
a

a
3000meter

here
the

widens
its

come
to
full

it
loses
its
speed
and
temperature
but
it
turns
into
a
sea
among
the
fish
that
the
nautilus
startled
on
its
way
ill
mention
a
onemeter
lumpfish
blackish
on
top
with
orange
on
the
belly
and
rare
among
its

on

a

the
nautiluss
fishermen
had
some
trouble
getting
a
grip
on
this
animal
which
thanks
to
the
formation
of
its
gill

can
protect
its
respiratory
organs
from
any

cod
species
which
i
detected
in
their
waters
of
choice
over
these
inexhaustible
grand
banks
because
newfoundland
is
simply
an
underwater
peak
you
could
call
these
cod
mountain
fish
while
the
nautilus
was
clearing
a
path
through
their
tight
ranks
conseil
couldnt
refrain
from
making
this
comment
mercy
look
at
these
cod
he
said
why
i
thought
cod
were
flat
like
dab
or
sole
innocent
boy
i
exclaimed
cod
are
flat
only
at
the
grocery
store
where
theyre
cut
open
and
spread
out
on
display
but
in
the
water
theyre
like
mullet
spindleshaped
and
perfectly
built
for
speed
i
can
easily
believe
master
conseil
replied
but
what
crowds
of
them
what
swarms
bah
my
friend
thered
be
many
more
without
their
enemies
scorpionfish
and
human
beings
do
you
know
how
many
eggs
have
been
counted
in
a
single
female
ill
go
all
out
conseil
replied
500000
11000000
my
friend
11000000
i
refuse
to
accept
that
until
i
count
them
myself
so
count
them
conseil
but
it
would
be
less
work
to
believe
me
besides
frenchmen
englishmen
americans
danes
and
norwegians
catch
these
cod
by
the
thousands
theyre
eaten
in
prodigious
quantities
and
without
the
astonishing
fertility
of
these
fish
the
seas
would
soon
be
depopulated
of
them
accordingly
in
england

america
alone
5000
ships
manned
by
75000
seamen
go
after
cod

brings
back
an
average
catch
of
4400

making
22000000
off
the
coast
of
norway
the
total
is
the
same
fine
conseil
replied
ill
take
masters
word
for
it
i
wont
count
them
count
what
those
11000000
eggs
but
ill
make
one
comment
whats
that
if
all
their
eggs
hatched
just
four
codfish
could
feed
england
america
and
norway
as
we
skimmed
the
depths
of
the
grand
banks
i
could
see
perfectly
those
long
fishing
lines
each
armed
with
200
hooks
that
every
boat
dangled
by
the
dozens
the
lower
end
of
each
line
dragged
the
bottom
by
means
of
a
small
grappling
iron
and
at
the
surface
it
was
secured
to
the
buoyrope
of
a
cork
float
the
nautilus
had
to
maneuver
shrewdly
in
the
midst
of
this
underwater
spiderweb
but
the
ship
didnt
stay
long
in
these
heavily
traveled
waterways
it
went
up
to
about
latitude
42
degrees
this
brought
it
abreast
of
st
johns
in
newfoundland
and
hearts
content
where
the
atlantic
cable
reaches
its
end
point
instead
of
continuing
north
the
nautilus
took
an
easterly
heading
as
if
to
go
along
this
plateau
on
which
the
telegraph
cable
rests
where
multiple
soundings
have
given
the
contours
of
the
terrain
with
the
utmost
accuracy
it
was
on
may
17
about
500
miles
from
hearts
content
and
2800
meters
down
that
i
spotted
this
cable
lying
on
the
seafloor
conseil
whom
i
hadnt
alerted
mistook
it
at
first
for
a
gigantic
sea
snake
and
was
gearing
up
to
classify
it
in
his
best
manner
but
i
enlightened
the
fine
lad
and
let
him
down
gently
by
giving
him
various
details
on
the
laying
of
this
cable
the
first
cable
was
put
down
during
the
years
18571858
but
after
transmitting
about
400
telegrams
it
went
dead
in
1863
engineers
built
a
new
cable
that
measured
3400
kilometers
weighed
4500
metric
tons
and
was
shipped
aboard
the
great
eastern
this
attempt
also
failed
now
then
on
may
25
while
submerged
to
a
depth
of
3836
meters
the
nautilus
lay
in
precisely
the
locality
where
this
second
cable
suffered
the
rupture
that
ruined
the
undertaking
it
happened
638
miles
from
the
coast
of
ireland
at
around
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
all
contact
with
europe
broke
off
the
electricians
on
board
decided
to
cut
the
cable
before
fishing
it
up
and
by
eleven
oclock
that
evening
they
had
retrieved
the
damaged
part
they
repaired
the
joint
and
its
splice
then
the
cable
was
resubmerged
but
a
few
days
later
it
snapped
again
and
couldnt
be
recovered
from
the
ocean
depths
these
americans
refused
to
give
up
the
daring
cyrus
field
who
had
risked
his
whole
fortune
to
promote
this
undertaking
called
for
a
new
bond
issue
it
sold
out
immediately
another
cable
was
put
down
under
better
conditions
its
sheaves
of
conducting
wire
were
insulated
within
a
guttapercha
covering
which
was
protected
by
a
padding
of
textile
material
enclosed
in
a
metal
sheath
the
great
eastern
put
back
to
sea
on
july
13
1866
the
operation
proceeded
apace
yet
there
was
one
hitch
as
they
gradually
unrolled
this
third
cable
the
electricians
observed
on
several
occasions
that
someone
had
recently
driven
nails
into
it
trying
to
damage
its
core
captain
anderson
his
officers
and
the
engineers
put
their
heads
together
then
posted
a
warning
that
if
the
culprit
were
detected
he
would
be
thrown
overboard
without
a
trial
after
that
these
villainous
attempts
were
not
repeated
by
july
23
the
great
eastern
was
lying
no
farther
than
800
kilometers
from
newfoundland
when
it
received
telegraphed
news
from
ireland
of
an
armistice
signed
between
prussia
and
austria
after
the
battle
of
sadova
through
the
mists
on
the
27th
it
sighted
the
port
of
hearts
content
the
undertaking
had
ended
happily
and
in
its
first
dispatch
young
america
addressed
old
europe
with
these
wise
words
so
rarely
understood
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
and
peace
on
earth
to
men
of
good
will
i
didnt
expect
to
find
this
electric
cable
in
mint
condition
as
it
looked
on
leaving
its
place
of
manufacture
the
long
snake
was
covered
with
seashell
rubble
and
bristling
with
foraminifera
a
crust
of
caked
gravel
protected
it
from
any
mollusks
that
might
bore
into
it
it
rested
serenely
sheltered
from
the
seas
motions
under
a
pressure
favorable
to
the
transmission
of
that
electric
spark
that
goes
from
america
to
europe
in
32100
of
a
second
this
cable
will
no
doubt
last
indefinitely
because
as
observers
note
its
guttapercha
casing
is
improved
by
a
stay
in
salt
water
besides
on
this
wellchosen
plateau
the
cable
never
lies
at
depths
that
could
cause
a
break
the
nautilus
followed
it
to
its
lowest
reaches
located
4431
meters
down
and
even
there
it
rested
without
any
stress
or
strain
then
we
returned
to
the
locality
where
the
1863
accident
had
taken
place
there
the
ocean
floor
formed
a
valley
120
kilometers
wide
into
which
you
could
fit
mt
blanc
without
its
summit
poking
above
the
surface
of
the
waves
this
valley
is
closed
off
to
the
east
by
a
sheer
wall
2000
meters
high
we
arrived
there
on
may
28
and
the
nautilus
lay
no
farther
than
150
kilometers
from
ireland
would
captain
nemo
head
up
north
and
beach
us
on
the
british
isles
no
much
to
my
surprise
he
went
back
down
south
and
returned
to
european
seas
as
we
swung
around
the
emerald
isle
i
spotted
cape
clear
for
an
instant
plus
the
lighthouse
on
fastnet
rock
that
guides
all
those
thousands
of
ships
setting
out
from
glasgow
or
liverpool
an
important
question
then
popped
into
my
head
would
the
nautilus
dare
to
tackle
the
english
channel
ned
land
who
promptly
reappeared
after
we
hugged
shore
never
stopped
questioning
me
what
could
i
answer
him
captain
nemo
remained
invisible
after
giving
the
canadian
a
glimpse
of
american
shores
was
he
about
to
show
me
the
coast
of
france
but
the
nautilus
kept
gravitating
southward
on
may
30
in
sight
of
lands
end
it
passed
between
the
lowermost
tip
of
england
and
the
scilly
islands
which
it
left
behind
to
starboard
if
it
was
going
to
enter
the
english
channel
it
clearly
needed
to
head
east
it
did
not
all
day
long
on
may
31
the
nautilus
swept
around
the
sea
in
a
series
of
circles
that
had
me
deeply
puzzled
it
seemed
to
be
searching
for
a
locality
that
it
had
some
trouble
finding
at
noon
captain
nemo
himself
came
to
take
our
bearings
he
didnt
address
a
word
to
me
he
looked
gloomier
than
ever
what
was
filling
him
with
such
sadness
was
it
our
proximity
to
these
european
shores
was
he
reliving
his
memories
of
that
country
he
had
left
behind
if
so
what
did
he
feel
remorse
or
regret
for
a
good
while
these
thoughts
occupied
my
mind
and
i
had
a
hunch
that
fate
would
soon
give
away
the
captains
secrets
the
next
day
june
1
the
nautilus
kept
to
the
same
tack
it
was
obviously
trying
to
locate
some
precise
spot
in
the
ocean
just
as
on
the
day
before
captain
nemo
came
to
take
the
altitude
of
the
sun
the
sea
was
smooth
the
skies
clear
eight
miles
to
the
east
a
big
steamship
was
visible
on
the
horizon
line
no
flag
was
flapping
from
the
gaff
of
its
foreandaft
sail
and
i
couldnt
tell
its
nationality
a
few
minutes
before
the
sun
passed
its
zenith
captain
nemo
raised
his
sextant
and
took
his
sights
with
the
utmost
precision
the
absolute
calm
of
the
waves
facilitated
this
operation
the
nautilus
lay
motionless
neither
rolling
nor
pitching
i
was
on
the
platform
just
then
after
determining
our
position
the
captain
pronounced
only
these
words
its
right
here
he
went
down
the
hatch
had
he
seen
that
vessel
change
course
and
seemingly
head
toward
us
im
unable
to
say
i
returned
to
the
lounge
the
hatch
closed
and
i
heard
water
hissing
in
the
ballast
tanks
the
nautilus
began
to
sink
on
a
vertical
line
because
its
propeller
was
in
check
and
no
longer
furnished
any
forward
motion
some
minutes
later
it
stopped
at
a
depth
of
833
meters
and
came
to
rest
on
the
seafloor
the
ceiling
lights
in
the
lounge
then
went
out
the
panels
opened
and
through
the
windows
i
saw
for
a
halfmile
radius
the
sea
brightly
lit
by
the
beacons
rays
i
looked
to
port
and
saw
nothing
but
the
immenseness
of
these
tranquil
waters
to
starboard
a
prominent
bulge
on
the
sea
bottom
caught
my
attention
you
would
have
thought
it
was
some
ruin
enshrouded
in
a
crust
of
whitened
seashells
as
if
under
a
mantle
of
snow
carefully
examining
this
mass
i
could
identify
the
swollen
outlines
of
a
ship
shorn
of
its
masts
which
must
have
sunk
bow
first
this
casualty
certainly
dated
from
some
faroff
time
to
be
so
caked
with
the
limestone
of
these
waters
this
wreckage
must
have
spent
many
a
year
on
the
ocean
floor
what
ship
was
this
why
had
the
nautilus
come
to
visit
its
grave
was
it
something
other
than
a
maritime
accident
that
had
dragged
this
craft
under
the
waters
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
but
next
to
me
i
heard
captain
nemos
voice
slowly
say
originally
this
ship
was
christened
the
marseillais
it
carried
seventyfour
cannons
and
was
launched
in
1762
on
august
13
1778
commanded
by
la
poypevertrieux
it
fought
valiantly
against
the
preston
on
july
4
1779
as
a
member
of
the
squadron
under
admiral
destaing
it
assisted
in
the
capture
of
the
island
of
grenada
on
september
5
1781
under
the
count
de
grasse
it
took
part
in
the
battle
of
chesapeake
bay
in
1794
the
new
republic
of
france
changed
the
name
of
this
ship
on
april
16
of
that
same
year
it
joined
the
squadron
at
brest
under
rear
admiral
villaret
de
joyeuse
who
was
entrusted
with
escorting
a
convoy
of
wheat
coming
from
america
under
the
command
of
admiral
van
stabel
in
this
second
year
of
the
french
revolutionary
calendar
on
the
11th
and
12th
days
in
the
month
of

this
squadron
fought
an
encounter
with
english
vessels

or
the

spot
in
latitude

and

this
ship
sank
after
a
heroic
battle
its
three
masts
gone
water
in
its
hold
a
third
of
its
crew
out
of
action
it
preferred
to
go
to
the
bottom
with
its
356
seamen
rather
than
surrender
and
with
its
flag
nailed
up
on
the
afterdeck
it
disappeared
beneath
the
waves
to
shouts
of
long
live
the
republic
this
is
the
avenger
i
exclaimed
yes
sir
the
avenger
a
splendid
name
captain
nemo
murmured
crossing
his
arms
chapter
21
a
mass
execution
the
way
he
said
this
the
unexpectedness
of
this
scene
first
the
biography
of
this
patriotic
ship
then
the
excitement
with
which
this
eccentric
individual
pronounced
these
last
wordsthe
name
avenger
whose
significance
could
not
escape
meall
this
taken
together
had
a
profound
impact
on
my
mind
my
eyes
never
left
the
captain
hands
outstretched
toward
the
sea
he
contemplated
the
proud
wreck
with
blazing
eyes
perhaps
i
would
never
learn
who
he
was
where
he
came
from
or
where
he
was
heading
but
more
and
more
i
could
see
a
distinction
between
the
man
and
the
scientist
it
was
no
ordinary
misanthropy
that
kept
captain
nemo
and
his
companions
sequestered
inside
the
nautiluss
plating
but
a
hate
so
monstrous
or
so
sublime
that
the
passing
years
could
never
weaken
it
did
this
hate
also
hunger
for
vengeance
time
would
soon
tell
meanwhile
the
nautilus
rose
slowly
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
i
watched
the
avengers
murky
shape
disappearing
little
by
little
soon
a
gentle
rolling
told
me
that
we
were
afloat
in
the
open
air
just
then
a
hollow
explosion
was
audible
i
looked
at
the
captain
the
captain
did
not
stir
captain
i
said
he
didnt
reply
i
left
him
and
climbed
onto
the
platform
conseil
and
the
canadian
were
already
there
what
caused
that
explosion
i
asked
a
cannon
going
off
ned
land
replied
i
stared
in
the
direction
of
the
ship
i
had
spotted
it
was
heading
toward
the
nautilus
and
you
could
tell
it
had
put
on
steam
six
miles
separated
it
from
us
what
sort
of
craft
is
it
ned
from
its
rigging
and
its
low
masts
the
canadian
replied
i
bet
its
a
warship
heres
hoping
it
pulls
up
and
sinks
this
damned
nautilus
ned
my
friend
conseil
replied
what
harm
could
it
do
the
nautilus
will
it
attack
us
under
the
waves
will
it
cannonade
us
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
tell
me
ned
i
asked
can
you
make
out
the
nationality
of
that
craft
creasing
his
brow
lowering
his
lids
and
puckering
the
corners
of
his
eyes
the
canadian
focused
the
full
power
of
his
gaze
on
the
ship
for
a
short
while
no
sir
he
replied
i
cant
make
out
what
nation
its
from
its
flying
no
flag
but
ill
swear
its
a
warship
because
theres
a
long
pennant
streaming
from
the
peak
of
its
mainmast
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
continued
to
watch
the
craft
bearing
down
on
us
but
it
was
inconceivable
to
me
that
it
had
discovered
the
nautilus
at
such
a
distance
still
less
that
it
knew
what
this
underwater
machine
really
was
soon
the
canadian
announced
that
the
craft
was
a
big
battleship
a
doubledecker
ironclad
complete
with
ram
dark
dense
smoke
burst
from
its
two
funnels
its
furled
sails
merged
with
the
lines
of
its
yardarms
the
gaff
of
its
foreandaft
sail
flew
no
flag
its
distance
still
kept
us
from
distinguishing
the
colors
of
its
pennant
which
was
fluttering
like
a
thin
ribbon
it
was
coming
on
fast
if
captain
nemo
let
it
approach
a
chance
for
salvation
might
be
available
to
us
sir
ned
land
told
me
if
that
boat
gets
within
a
mile
of
us
im
jumping
overboard
and
i
suggest
you
follow
suit
i
didnt
reply
to
the
canadians
proposition
but
kept
watching
the
ship
which
was
looming
larger
on
the
horizon
whether
it
was
english
french
american
or
russian
it
would
surely
welcome
us
aboard
if
we
could
just
get
to
it
master
may
recall
conseil
then
said
that
we
have
some
experience
with
swimming
he
can
rely
on
me
to
tow
him
to
that
vessel
if
hes
agreeable
to
going
with
our
friend
ned
before
i
could
reply
white
smoke
streamed
from
the
battleships
bow
then
a
few
seconds
later
the
waters
splashed
astern
of
the
nautilus
disturbed
by
the
fall
of
a
heavy
object
soon
after
an
explosion
struck
my
ears
whats
this
theyre
firing
at
us
i
exclaimed
good
lads
the
canadian
muttered
that
means
they
dont
see
us
as
castaways
clinging
to
some
wreckage
with
all
due
respect
to
mastergracious
conseil
put
in
shaking
off
the
water
that
had
sprayed
over
him
from
another
shell
with
all
due
respect
to
master
theyve
discovered
the
narwhale
and
theyre
cannonading
the
same
but
it
must
be
clear
to
them
i
exclaimed
that
theyre
dealing
with
human
beings
maybe
thats
why
ned
land
replied
staring
hard
at
me
the
full
truth
dawned
on
me
undoubtedly
people
now
knew
where
they
stood
on
the
existence
of
this
socalled
monster
undoubtedly
the
latters
encounter
with
the
abraham
lincoln
when
the
canadian
hit
it
with
his
harpoon
had
led
commander
farragut
to
recognize
the
narwhale
as
actually
an
underwater
boat
more
dangerous
than
any
unearthly
cetacean
yes
this
had
to
be
the
case
and
undoubtedly
they
were
now
chasing
this
dreadful
engine
of
destruction
on
every
sea
dreadful
indeed
if
as
we
could
assume
captain
nemo
had
been
using
the
nautilus
in
works
of
vengeance
that
night
in
the
middle
of
the
indian
ocean
when
he
imprisoned
us
in
the
cell
hadnt
he
attacked
some
ship
that
man
now
buried
in
the
coral
cemetery
wasnt
he
the
victim
of
some
collision
caused
by
the
nautilus
yes
i
repeat
this
had
to
be
the
case
one
part
of
captain
nemos
secret
life
had
been
unveiled
and
now
even
though
his
identity
was
still
unknown
at
least
the
nations
allied
against
him
knew
they
were
no
longer
hunting
some
fairytale
monster
but
a
man
who
had
sworn
an
implacable
hate
toward
them
this
whole
fearsome
sequence
of
events
appeared
in
my
minds
eye
instead
of
encountering
friends
on
this
approaching
ship
we
would
find
only
pitiless
enemies
meanwhile
shells
fell
around
us
in
increasing
numbers
some
meeting
the
liquid
surface
would
ricochet
and
vanish
into
the
sea
at
considerable
distances
but
none
of
them
reached
the
nautilus
by
then
the
ironclad
was
no
more
than
three
miles
off
despite
its
violent
cannonade
captain
nemo
hadnt
appeared
on
the
platform
and
yet
if
one
of
those
conical
shells
had
scored
a
routine
hit
on
the
nautiluss
hull
it
could
have
been
fatal
to
him
the
canadian
then
told
me
sir
weve
got
to
do
everything
we
can
to
get
out
of
this
jam
lets
signal
them
damnation
maybe
theyll
realize
were
decent
people
ned
land
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
to
wave
it
in
the
air
but
he
had
barely
unfolded
it
when
he
was
felled
by
an
iron
fist
and
despite
his
great
strength
he
tumbled
to
the
deck
scum
the
captain
shouted
do
you
want
to
be
nailed
to
the
nautiluss
spur
before
it
charges
that
ship
dreadful
to
hear
captain
nemo
was
even
more
dreadful
to
see
his
face
was
pale
from
some
spasm
of
his
heart
which
must
have
stopped
beating
for
an
instant
his
pupils
were
hideously
contracted
his
voice
was
no
longer
speaking
it
was
bellowing
bending
from
the
waist
he
shook
the
canadian
by
the
shoulders
then
dropping
ned
and
turning
to
the
battleship
whose
shells
were
showering
around
him
o
ship
of
an
accursed
nation
you
know
who
i
am
he
shouted
in
his
powerful
voice
and
i
dont
need
your
colors
to
recognize
you
look
ill
show
you
mine
and
in
the
bow
of
the
platform
captain
nemo
unfurled
a
black
flag
like
the
one
he
had
left
planted
at
the
south
pole
just
then
a
shell
hit
the
nautiluss
hull
obliquely
failed
to
breach
it
ricocheted
near
the
captain
and
vanished
into
the
sea
captain
nemo
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
addressing
me
go
below
he
told
me
in
a
curt
tone
you
and
your
companions
go
below
sir
i
exclaimed
are
you
going
to
attack
this
ship
sir
im
going
to
sink
it
you
wouldnt
i
will
captain
nemo
replied
icily
youre
illadvised
to
pass
judgment
on
me
sir
fate
has
shown
you
what
you
werent
meant
to
see
the
attack
has
come
our
reply
will
be
dreadful
get
back
inside
from
what
country
is
that
ship
you
dont
know
fine
so
much
the
better
at
least
its
nationality
will
remain
a
secret
to
you
go
below
the
canadian
conseil
and
i
could
only
obey
some
fifteen
of
the
nautiluss
seamen
surrounded
their
captain
and
stared
with
a
feeling
of
implacable
hate
at
the
ship
bearing
down
on
them
you
could
feel
the
same
spirit
of
vengeance
enkindling
their
every
soul
i
went
below
just
as
another
projectile
scraped
the
nautiluss
hull
and
i
heard
the
captain
exclaim
shoot
you
demented
vessel
shower
your
futile
shells
you
wont
escape
the
nautiluss
spur
but
this
isnt
the
place
where
youll
perish
i
dont
want
your
wreckage
mingling
with
that
of
the
avenger
i
repaired
to
my
stateroom
the
captain
and
his
chief
officer
stayed
on
the
platform
the
propeller
was
set
in
motion
the
nautilus
swiftly
retreated
putting
us
outside
the
range
of
the
vessels
shells
but
the
chase
continued
and
captain
nemo
was
content
to
keep
his
distance
near
four
oclock
in
the
afternoon
unable
to
control
the
impatience
and
uneasiness
devouring
me
i
went
back
to
the
central
companionway
the
hatch
was
open
i
ventured
onto
the
platform
the
captain
was
still
strolling
there
his
steps
agitated
he
stared
at
the
ship
which
stayed
to
his
leeward
five
or
six
miles
off
he
was
circling
it
like
a
wild
beast
drawing
it
eastward
letting
it
chase
after
him
yet
he
didnt
attack
was
he
perhaps
still
undecided
i
tried
to
intervene
one
last
time
but
i
had
barely
queried
captain
nemo
when
the
latter
silenced
me
im
the
law
im
the
tribunal
im
the
oppressed
and
there
are
my
oppressors
thanks
to
them
ive
witnessed
the
destruction
of
everything
i
loved
cherished
and
veneratedhomeland
wife
children
father
and
mother
there
lies
everything
i
hate
not
another
word
out
of
you
i
took
a
last
look
at
the
battleship
which
was
putting
on
steam
then
i
rejoined
ned
and
conseil
well
escape
i
exclaimed
good
ned
put
in
wheres
that
ship
from
ive
no
idea
but
wherever
its
from
it
will
sink
before
nightfall
in
any
event
its
better
to
perish
with
it
than
be
accomplices
in
some
act
of
revenge
whose
merits
we
cant
gauge
thats
my
feeling
ned
land
replied
coolly
lets
wait
for
nightfall
night
fell
a
profound
silence
reigned
on
board
the
compass
indicated
that
the
nautilus
hadnt
changed
direction
i
could
hear
the
beat
of
its
propeller
churning
the
waves
with
steady
speed
staying
on
the
surface
of
the
water
it
rolled
gently
sometimes
to
one
side
sometimes
to
the
other
my
companions
and
i
had
decided
to
escape
as
soon
as
the
vessel
came
close
enough
for
us
to
be
heardor
seen
because
the
moon
would
wax
full
in
three
days
and
was
shining
brightly
once
we
were
aboard
that
ship
if
we
couldnt
ward
off
the
blow
that
threatened
it
at
least
we
could
do
everything
that
circumstances
permitted
several
times
i
thought
the
nautilus
was
about
to
attack
but
it
was
content
to
let
its
adversary
approach
and
then
it
would
quickly
resume
its
retreating
ways
part
of
the
night
passed
without
incident
we
kept
watch
for
an
opportunity
to
take
action
we
talked
little
being
too
keyed
up
ned
land
was
all
for
jumping
overboard
i
forced
him
to
wait
as
i
saw
it
the
nautilus
would
attack
the
doubledecker
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
and
then
it
would
be
not
only
possible
but
easy
to
escape
at
three
oclock
in
the
morning
full
of
uneasiness
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
captain
nemo
hadnt
left
it
he
stood
in
the
bow
next
to
his
flag
which
a
mild
breeze
was
unfurling
above
his
head
his
eyes
never
left
that
vessel
the
extraordinary
intensity
of
his
gaze
seemed
to
attract
it
beguile
it
and
draw
it
more
surely
than
if
he
had
it
in
tow
the
moon
then
passed
its
zenith
jupiter
was
rising
in
the
east
in
the
midst
of
this
placid
natural
setting
sky
and
ocean
competed
with
each
other
in
tranquility
and
the
sea
offered
the
orb
of
night
the
loveliest
mirror
ever
to
reflect
its
image
and
when
i
compared
this
deep
calm
of
the
elements
with
all
the
fury
seething
inside
the
plating
of
this
barely
perceptible
nautilus
i
shivered
all
over
the
vessel
was
two
miles
off
it
drew
nearer
always
moving
toward
the
phosphorescent
glow
that
signaled
the
nautiluss
presence
i
saw
its
green
and
red
running
lights
plus
the
white
lantern
hanging
from
the
large
stay
of
its
foremast
hazy
flickerings
were
reflected
on
its
rigging
and
indicated
that
its
furnaces
were
pushed
to
the
limit
showers
of
sparks
and
cinders
of
flaming
coal
escaped
from
its
funnels
spangling
the
air
with
stars
i
stood
there
until
six
oclock
in
the
morning
captain
nemo
never
seeming
to
notice
me
the
vessel
lay
a
mile
and
a
half
off
and
with
the
first
glimmers
of
daylight
it
resumed
its
cannonade
the
time
couldnt
be
far
away
when
the
nautilus
would
attack
its
adversary
and
my
companions
and
i
would
leave
forever
this
man
i
dared
not
judge
i
was
about
to
go
below
to
alert
them
when
the
chief
officer
climbed
onto
the
platform
several
seamen
were
with
him
captain
nemo
didnt
see
them
or
didnt
want
to
see
them
they
carried
out
certain
procedures
that
on
the
nautilus
you
could
call
clearing
the
decks
for
action
they
were
quite
simple
the
manropes
that
formed
a
handrail
around
the
platform
were
lowered
likewise
the
pilothouse
and
the
beacon
housing
were
withdrawn
into
the
hull
until
they
lay
exactly
flush
with
it
the
surface
of
this
long
sheetiron
cigar
no
longer
offered
a
single
protrusion
that
could
hamper
its
maneuvers
i
returned
to
the
lounge
the
nautilus
still
emerged
above
the
surface
a
few
morning
gleams
infiltrated
the
liquid
strata
beneath
the
undulations
of
the
billows
the
windows
were
enlivened
by
the
blushing
of
the
rising
sun
that
dreadful
day
of
june
2
had
dawned
at
seven
oclock
the
log
told
me
that
the
nautilus
had
reduced
speed
i
realized
that
it
was
letting
the
warship
approach
moreover
the
explosions
grew
more
intensely
audible
shells
furrowed
the
water
around
us
drilling
through
it
with
an
odd
hissing
sound
my
friends
i
said
its
time
lets
shake
hands
and
may
god
be
with
us
ned
land
was
determined
conseil
calm
i
myself
nervous
and
barely
in
control
we
went
into
the
library
just
as
i
pushed
open
the
door
leading
to
the
well
of
the
central
companionway
i
heard
the
hatch
close
sharply
overhead
the
canadian
leaped
up
the
steps
but
i
stopped
him
a
wellknown
hissing
told
me
that
water
was
entering
the
ships
ballast
tanks
indeed
in
a
few
moments
the
nautilus
had
submerged
some
meters
below
the
surface
of
the
waves
i
understood
this
maneuver
it
was
too
late
to
take
action
the
nautilus
wasnt
going
to
strike
the
doubledecker
where
it
was
clad
in
impenetrable
iron
armor
but
below
its
waterline
where
the
metal
carapace
no
longer
protected
its
planking
we
were
prisoners
once
more
unwilling
spectators
at
the
performance
of
this
gruesome
drama
but
we
barely
had
time
to
think
taking
refuge
in
my
stateroom
we
stared
at
each
other
without
pronouncing
a
word
my
mind
was
in
a
total
daze
my
mental
processes
came
to
a
dead
stop
i
hovered
in
that
painful
state
that
predominates
during
the
period
of
anticipation
before
some
frightful
explosion
i
waited
i
listened
i
lived
only
through
my
sense
of
hearing
meanwhile
the
nautiluss
speed
had
increased
appreciably
so
it
was
gathering
momentum
its
entire
hull
was
vibrating
suddenly
i
let
out
a
yell
there
had
been
a
collision
but
it
was
comparatively
mild
i
could
feel
the
penetrating
force
of
the
steel
spur
i
could
hear
scratchings
and
scrapings
carried
away
with
its
driving
power
the
nautilus
had
passed
through
the
vessels
mass
like
a
sailmakers
needle
through
canvas
i
couldnt
hold
still
frantic
going
insane
i
leaped
out
of
my
stateroom
and
rushed
into
the
lounge
captain
nemo
was
there
mute
gloomy
implacable
he
was
staring
through
the
port
panel
an
enormous
mass
was
sinking
beneath
the
waters
and
the
nautilus
missing
none
of
its
death
throes
was
descending
into
the
depths
with
it
ten
meters
away
i
could
see
its
gaping
hull
into
which
water
was
rushing
with
a
sound
of
thunder
then
its
double
rows
of
cannons
and
railings
its
deck
was
covered
with
dark
quivering
shadows
the
water
was
rising
those
poor
men
leaped
up
into
the
shrouds
clung
to
the
masts
writhed
beneath
the
waters
it
was
a
human
anthill
that
an
invading
sea
had
caught
by
surprise
paralyzed
rigid
with
anguish
my
hair
standing
on
end
my
eyes
popping
out
of
my
head
short
of
breath
suffocating
speechless
i
staredi
too
i
was
glued
to
the
window
by
an
irresistible
allure
the
enormous
vessel
settled
slowly
following
it
down
the
nautilus
kept
watch
on
its
every
movement
suddenly
there
was
an
eruption
the
air
compressed
inside
the
craft
sent
its
decks
flying
as
if
the
powder
stores
had
been
ignited
the
thrust
of
the
waters
was
so
great
the
nautilus
swerved
away
the
poor
ship
then
sank
more
swiftly
its
mastheads
appeared
laden
with
victims
then
its
crosstrees
bending
under
clusters
of
men
finally
the
peak
of
its
mainmast
then
the
dark
mass
disappeared
and
with
it
a
crew
of
corpses
dragged
under
by
fearsome
eddies



i
turned
to
captain
nemo
this
dreadful
executioner
this
true
archangel
of
hate
was
still
staring
when
it
was
all
over
captain
nemo
headed
to
the
door
of
his
stateroom
opened
it
and
entered
i
followed
him
with
my
eyes
on
the
rear
paneling
beneath
the
portraits
of
his
heroes
i
saw
the
portrait
of
a
stillyouthful
woman
with
two
little
children
captain
nemo
stared
at
them
for
a
few
moments
stretched
out
his
arms
to
them
sank
to
his
knees
and
melted
into
sobs
chapter
22
the
last
words
of
captain
nemo
the
panels
closed
over
this
frightful
view
but
the
lights
didnt
go
on
in
the
lounge
inside
the
nautilus
all
was
gloom
and
silence
it
left
this
place
of
devastation
with
prodigious
speed
100
feet
beneath
the
waters
where
was
it
going
north
or
south
where
would
the
man
flee
after
this
horrible
act
of
revenge
i
reentered
my
stateroom
where
ned
and
conseil
were
waiting
silently
captain
nemo
filled
me
with
insurmountable
horror
whatever
he
had
once
suffered
at
the
hands
of
humanity
he
had
no
right
to
mete
out
such
punishment
he
had
made
me
if
not
an
accomplice
at
least
an
eyewitness
to
his
vengeance
even
this
was
intolerable
at
eleven
oclock
the
electric
lights
came
back
on
i
went
into
the
lounge
it
was
deserted
i
consulted
the
various
instruments
the
nautilus
was
fleeing
northward
at
a
speed
of
twentyfive
miles
per
hour
sometimes
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
sometimes
thirty
feet
beneath
it
after
our
position
had
been
marked
on
the
chart
i
saw
that
we
were
passing
into
the
mouth
of
the
english
channel
that
our
heading
would
take
us
to
the
northernmost
seas
with
incomparable
speed
i
could
barely
glimpse
the
swift
passing
of
longnose
sharks
hammerhead
sharks
spotted
dogfish
that
frequent
these
waters
big
eagle
rays
swarms
of
seahorse
looking
like
knights
on
a
chessboard
eels
quivering
like
fireworks
serpents
armies
of
crab
that
fled
obliquely
by
crossing
their
pincers
over
their
carapaces
finally
schools
of
porpoise
that
held
contests
of
speed
with
the
nautilus
but
by
this
point
observing
studying
and
classifying
were
out
of
the
question
by
evening
we
had
cleared
200
leagues
up
the
atlantic
shadows
gathered
and
gloom
overran
the
sea
until
the
moon
came
up
i
repaired
to
my
stateroom
i
couldnt
sleep
i
was
assaulted
by
nightmares
that
horrible
scene
of
destruction
kept
repeating
in
my
minds
eye
from
that
day
forward
who
knows
where
the
nautilus
took
us
in
the
north
atlantic
basin
always
at
incalculable
speed
always
amid
the
high
arctic
mists
did
it
call
at
the
capes
of
spitzbergen
or
the
shores
of
novaya
zemlya
did
it
visit
such
uncharted
seas
as
the
white
sea
the
kara
sea
the
gulf
of
ob
the
lyakhov
islands
or
those
unknown
beaches
on
the
siberian
coast
im
unable
to
say
i
lost
track
of
the
passing
hours
time
was
in
abeyance
on
the
ships
clocks
as
happens
in
the
polar
regions
it
seemed
that
night
and
day
no
longer
followed
their
normal
sequence
i
felt
myself
being
drawn
into
that
strange
domain
where
the
overwrought
imagination
of
edgar
allan
poe
was
at
home
like
his
fabled
arthur
gordon

i
expected
any
moment
to
see
that
shrouded
human
figure
very
far
larger
in
its
proportions
than
any
dweller
among
men
thrown
across
the
cataract
that
protects
the
outskirts
of
the
pole
i
estimatebut
perhaps
im
mistakenthat
the
nautiluss
haphazard
course
continued
for
fifteen
or
twenty
days
and
im
not
sure
how
long
this
would
have
gone
on
without
the
catastrophe
that
ended
our
voyage
as
for
captain
nemo
he
was
no
longer
in
the
picture
as
for
his
chief
officer
the
same
applied
not
one
crewman
was
visible
for
a
single
instant
the
nautilus
cruised
beneath
the
waters
almost
continuously
when
it
rose
briefly
to
the
surface
to
renew
our
air
the
hatches
opened
and
closed
as
if
automated
no
more
positions
were
reported
on
the
world
map
i
didnt
know
where
we
were
ill
also
mention
that
the
canadian
at
the
end
of
his
strength
and
patience
made
no
further
appearances
conseil
couldnt
coax
a
single
word
out
of
him
and
feared
that
in
a
fit
of
delirium
while
under
the
sway
of
a
ghastly
homesickness
ned
would
kill
himself
so
he
kept
a
devoted
watch
on
his
friend
every
instant
you
can
appreciate
that
under
these
conditions
our
situation
had
become
untenable
one
morningwhose
date
im
unable
to
specifyi
was
slumbering
near
the
first
hours
of
daylight
a
painful
sickly
slumber
waking
up
i
saw
ned
land
leaning
over
me
and
i
heard
him
tell
me
in
a
low
voice
were
going
to
escape
i
sat
up
when
i
asked
tonight
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
supervision
left
on
the
nautilus
youd
think
a
total
daze
was
reigning
on
board
will
you
be
ready
sir
yes
where
are
we
in
sight
of
land
i
saw
it
through
the
mists
just
this
morning
twenty
miles
to
the
east
what
land
is
it
ive
no
idea
but
whatever
it
is
there
well
take
refuge
yes
ned
well
escape
tonight
even
if
the
sea
swallows
us
up
the
seas
rough
the
winds
blowing
hard
but
a
twentymile
run
in
the
nautiluss
nimble
longboat
doesnt
scare
me
unknown
to
the
crew
ive
stowed
some
food
and
flasks
of
water
inside
im
with
you
whats
more
the
canadian
added
if
they
catch
me
ill
defend
myself
ill
fight
to
the
death
then
well
die
together
ned
my
friend
my
mind
was
made
up
the
canadian
left
me
i
went
out
on
the
platform
where
i
could
barely
stand
upright
against
the
jolts
of
the
billows
the
skies
were
threatening
but
land
lay
inside
those
dense
mists
and
we
had
to
escape
not
a
single
day
or
even
a
single
hour
could
we
afford
to
lose
i
returned
to
the
lounge
dreading
yet
desiring
an
encounter
with
captain
nemo
wanting
yet
not
wanting
to
see
him
what
would
i
say
to
him
how
could
i
hide
the
involuntary
horror
he
inspired
in
me
no
it
was
best
not
to
meet
him
face
to
face
best
to
try
and
forget
him
and
yet




how
long
that
day
seemed
the
last
i
would
spend
aboard
the
nautilus
i
was
left
to
myself
ned
land
and
conseil
avoided
speaking
to
me
afraid
they
would
give
themselves
away
at
six
oclock
i
ate
supper
but
i
had
no
appetite
despite
my
revulsion
i
forced
it
down
wanting
to
keep
my
strength
up
at
630
ned
land
entered
my
stateroom
he
told
me
we
wont
see
each
other
again
before
we
go
at
ten
oclock
the
moon
wont
be
up
yet
well
take
advantage
of
the
darkness
come
to
the
skiff
conseil
and
i
will
be
inside
waiting
for
you
the
canadian
left
without
giving
me
time
to
answer
him
i
wanted
to
verify
the
nautiluss
heading
i
made
my
way
to
the
lounge
we
were
racing
northnortheast
with
frightful
speed
fifty
meters
down
i
took
one
last
look
at
the
natural
wonders
and
artistic
treasures
amassed
in
the
museum
this
unrivaled
collection
doomed
to
perish
someday
in
the
depths
of
the
seas
together
with
its
curator
i
wanted
to
establish
one
supreme
impression
in
my
mind
i
stayed
there
an
hour
basking
in
the
aura
of
the
ceiling
lights
passing
in
review
the
treasures
shining
in
their
glass
cases
then
i
returned
to
my
stateroom
there
i
dressed
in
sturdy
seafaring
clothes
i
gathered
my
notes
and
packed
them
tenderly
about
my
person
my
heart
was
pounding
mightily
i
couldnt
curb
its
pulsations
my
anxiety
and
agitation
would
certainly
have
given
me
away
if
captain
nemo
had
seen
me
what
was
he
doing
just
then
i
listened
at
the
door
to
his
stateroom
i
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
captain
nemo
was
inside
he
hadnt
gone
to
bed
with
his
every
movement
i
imagined
he
would
appear
and
ask
me
why
i
wanted
to
escape
i
felt
in
a
perpetual
state
of
alarm
my
imagination
magnified
this
sensation
the
feeling
became
so
acute
i
wondered
whether
it
wouldnt
be
better
to
enter
the
captains
stateroom
dare
him
face
to
face
brave
it
out
with
word
and
deed
it
was
an
insane
idea
fortunately
i
controlled
myself
and
stretched
out
on
the
bed
to
soothe
my
bodily
agitation
my
nerves
calmed
a
little
but
with
my
brain
so
aroused
i
did
a
swift
review
of
my
whole
existence
aboard
the
nautilus
every
pleasant
or
unpleasant
incident
that
had
crossed
my
path
since
i
went
overboard
from
the
abraham
lincoln
the
underwater
hunting
trip
the
torres
strait
our
running
aground
the
savages
of
papua
the
coral
cemetery
the
suez
passageway
the
island
of
santorini
the
cretan
diver
the
bay
of
vigo
atlantis
the
ice
bank
the
south
pole
our
imprisonment
in
the
ice
the
battle
with
the
devilfish
the
storm
in
the
gulf
stream
the
avenger
and
that
horrible
scene
of
the
vessel
sinking
with
its
crew




all
these
events
passed
before
my
eyes
like
backdrops
unrolling
upstage
in
a
theater
in
this
strange
setting
captain
nemo
then
grew
fantastically
his
features
were
accentuated
taking
on
superhuman
proportions
he
was
no
longer
my
equal
he
was
the
man
of
the
waters
the
spirit
of
the
seas
by
then
it
was
930
i
held
my
head
in
both
hands
to
keep
it
from
bursting
i
closed
my
eyes
i
no
longer
wanted
to
think
a
half
hour
still
to
wait
a
half
hour
of
nightmares
that
could
drive
me
insane
just
then
i
heard
indistinct
chords
from
the
organ
melancholy
harmonies
from
some
undefinable
hymn
actual
pleadings
from
a
soul
trying
to
sever
its
earthly
ties
i
listened
with
all
my
senses
at
once
barely
breathing
immersed
like
captain
nemo
in
this
musical
trance
that
was
drawing
him
beyond
the
bounds
of
this
world
then
a
sudden
thought
terrified
me
captain
nemo
had
left
his
stateroom
he
was
in
the
same
lounge
i
had
to
cross
in
order
to
escape
there
i
would
encounter
him
one
last
time
he
would
see
me
perhaps
speak
to
me
one
gesture
from
him
could
obliterate
me
a
single
word
shackle
me
to
his
vessel
even
so
ten
oclock
was
about
to
strike
it
was
time
to
leave
my
stateroom
and
rejoin
my
companions
i
dared
not
hesitate
even
if
captain
nemo
stood
before
me
i
opened
the
door
cautiously
but
as
it
swung
on
its
hinges
it
seemed
to
make
a
frightful
noise
this
noise
existed
perhaps
only
in
my
imagination
i
crept
forward
through
the
nautiluss
dark
gangways
pausing
after
each
step
to
curb
the
pounding
of
my
heart
i
arrived
at
the
corner
door
of
the
lounge
i
opened
it
gently
the
lounge
was
plunged
in
profound
darkness
chords
from
the
organ
were
reverberating
faintly
captain
nemo
was
there
he
didnt
see
me
even
in
broad
daylight
i
doubt
that
he
would
have
noticed
me
so
completely
was
he
immersed
in
his
trance
i
inched
over
the
carpet
avoiding
the
tiniest
bump
whose
noise
might
give
me
away
it
took
me
five
minutes
to
reach
the
door
at
the
far
end
which
led
into
the
library
i
was
about
to
open
it
when
a
gasp
from
captain
nemo
nailed
me
to
the
spot
i
realized
that
he
was
standing
up
i
even
got
a
glimpse
of
him
because
some
rays
of
light
from
the
library
had
filtered
into
the
lounge
he
was
coming
toward
me
arms
crossed
silent
not
walking
but
gliding
like
a
ghost
his
chest
was
heaving
swelling
with
sobs
and
i
heard
him
murmur
these
words
the
last
of
his
to
reach
my
ears
o
almighty
god
enough
enough
was
it
a
vow
of
repentance
that
had
just
escaped
from
this
mans
conscience




frantic
i
rushed
into
the
library
i
climbed
the
central
companionway
and
going
along
the
upper
gangway
i
arrived
at
the
skiff
i
went
through
the
opening
that
had
already
given
access
to
my
two
companions
lets
go
lets
go
i
exclaimed
right
away
the
canadian
replied
first
ned
land
closed
and
bolted
the
opening
cut
into
the
nautiluss
sheet
iron
using
the
monkey
wrench
he
had
with
him
after
likewise
closing
the
opening
in
the
skiff
the
canadian
began
to
unscrew
the
nuts
still
bolting
us
to
the
underwater
boat
suddenly
a
noise
from
the
ships
interior
became
audible
voices
were
answering
each
other
hurriedly
what
was
it
had
they
spotted
our
escape
i
felt
ned
land
sliding
a
dagger
into
my
hand
yes
i
muttered
we
know
how
to
die
the
canadian
paused
in
his
work
but
one
word
twenty
times
repeated
one
dreadful
word
told
me
the
reason
for
the
agitation
spreading
aboard
the
nautilus
we
werent
the
cause
of
the
crews
concern
maelstrom
maelstrom
they
were
shouting
the
maelstrom
could
a
more
frightening
name
have
rung
in
our
ears
under
more
frightening
circumstances
were
we
lying
in
the
dangerous
waterways
off
the
norwegian
coast
was
the
nautilus
being
dragged
into
this
whirlpool
just
as
the
skiff
was
about
to
detach
from
its
plating
as
you
know
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
the
waters
confined
between
the
faroe
and
lofoten
islands
rush
out
with
irresistible
violence
they
form
a
vortex
from
which
no
ship
has
ever
been
able
to
escape
monstrous
waves
race
together
from
every
point
of
the
horizon
they
form
a
whirlpool
aptly
called
the
oceans
navel
whose
attracting
power
extends
a
distance
of
fifteen
kilometers
it
can
suck
down
not
only
ships
but
whales
and
even
polar
bears
from
the
northernmost
regions
this
was
where
the
nautilus
had
been
sent
accidentallyor
perhaps
deliberatelyby
its
captain
it
was
sweeping
around
in
a
spiral
whose
radius
kept
growing
smaller
and
smaller
the
skiff
still
attached
to
the
ships
plating
was
likewise
carried
around
at
dizzying
speed
i
could
feel
us
whirling
i
was
experiencing
that
accompanying
nausea
that
follows
such
continuous
spinning
motions
we
were
in
dread
in
the
last
stages
of
sheer
horror
our
blood
frozen
in
our
veins
our
nerves
numb
drenched
in
cold
sweat
as
if
from
the
throes
of
dying
and
what
a
noise
around
our
frail
skiff
what
roars
echoing
from
several
miles
away
what
crashes
from
the
waters
breaking
against
sharp
rocks
on
the
seafloor
where
the
hardest
objects
are
smashed
where
tree
trunks
are
worn
down
and
worked
into
a
shaggy
fur
as
norwegians
express
it
what
a
predicament
we
were
rocking
frightfully
the
nautilus
defended
itself
like
a
human
being
its
steel
muscles
were
cracking
sometimes
it
stood
on
end
the
three
of
us
along
with
it
weve
got
to
hold
on
tight
ned
said
and
screw
the
nuts
down
again
if
we
can
stay
attached
to
the
nautilus
we
can
still
make
it




he
hadnt
finished
speaking
when
a
cracking
sound
occurred
the
nuts
gave
way
and
ripped
out
of
its
socket
the
skiff
was
hurled
like
a
stone
from
a
sling
into
the
midst
of
the
vortex
my
head
struck
against
an
iron
timber
and
with
this
violent
shock
i
lost
consciousness

conclusion
we
come
to
the
conclusion
of
this
voyage
under
the
seas
what
happened
that
night
how
the
skiff
escaped
from
the
maelstroms
fearsome
eddies
how
ned
land
conseil
and
i
got
out
of
that
whirlpool
im
unable
to
say
but
when
i
regained
consciousness
i
was
lying
in
a
fishermans
hut
on
one
of
the
lofoten
islands
my
two
companions
safe
and
sound
were
at
my
bedside
clasping
my
hands
we
embraced
each
other
heartily
just
now
we
cant
even
dream
of
returning
to
france
travel
between
upper
norway
and
the
south
is
limited
so
i
have
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
a
steamboat
that
provides
bimonthly
service
from
north
cape
so
it
is
here
among
these
gallant
people
who
have
taken
us
in
that
im
reviewing
my
narrative
of
these
adventures
it
is
accurate
not
a
fact
has
been
omitted
not
a
detail
has
been
exaggerated
its
the
faithful
record
of
this
inconceivable
expedition
into
an
element
now
beyond
human
reach
but
where
progress
will
someday
make
great
inroads
will
anyone
believe
me
i
dont
know
ultimately
its
unimportant
what
i
can
now
assert
is
that
ive
earned
the
right
to
speak
of
these
seas
beneath
which
in
less
than
ten
months
ive
cleared
20000
leagues
in
this
underwater
tour
of
the
world
that
has
shown
me
so
many
wonders
across
the
pacific
the
indian
ocean
the
red
sea
the
mediterranean
the
atlantic
the
southernmost
and
northernmost
seas
but
what
happened
to
the
nautilus
did
it
withstand
the
maelstroms
clutches
is
captain
nemo
alive
is
he
still
under
the
ocean
pursuing
his
frightful
program
of
revenge
or
did
he
stop
after
that
latest
mass
execution
will
the
waves
someday
deliver
that
manuscript
that
contains
his
full
life
story
will
i
finally
learn
the
mans
name
will
the
nationality
of
the
stricken
warship
tell
us
the
nationality
of
captain
nemo
i
hope
so
i
likewise
hope
that
his
powerful
submersible
has
defeated
the
sea
inside
its
most
dreadful
whirlpool
that
the
nautilus
has
survived
where
so
many
ships
have
perished
if
this
is
the
case
and
captain
nemo
still
inhabits
the
oceanhis
adopted
countrymay
the
hate
be
appeased
in
that
fierce
heart
may
the
contemplation
of
so
many
wonders
extinguish
the
spirit
of
vengeance
in
him
may
the
executioner
pass
away
and
the
scientist
continue
his
peaceful
exploration
of
the
seas
if
his
destiny
is
strange
its
also
sublime
havent
i
encompassed
it
myself
didnt
i
lead
ten
months
of
this
otherworldly
existence
thus
to
that
question
asked
6000
years
ago
in
the
book
of
ecclesiasteswho
can
fathom
the
soundless
depthstwo
men
out
of
all
humanity
have
now
