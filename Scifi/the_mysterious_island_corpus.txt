more
than
500
feet
from

overboard
with
every
weight

everything
such
were
the
loud
and
startling
words
which
resounded
through
the
air
above
the
vast
watery
desert
of
the
pacific
about
four
oclock
in
the
evening
of
the
23rd
of
march
1865
few
can
possibly
have
forgotten
the
terrible
storm
from
the
northeast
in
the
middle
of
the
equinox
of
that
year
the
tempest
raged
without
intermission
from
the
18th
to
the
26th
of
march
its
ravages
were
terrible
in
america
europe
and
asia
covering
a
distance
of
eighteen
hundred
miles
and
extending
obliquely
to
the
equator
from
the
thirtyfifth
north
parallel
to
the
fortieth
south
parallel
towns
were
overthrown
forests
uprooted
coasts
devastated
by
the
mountains
of
water
which
were
precipitated
on
them
vessels
cast
on
the
shore
which
the
published
accounts
numbered
by
hundreds
whole
districts
leveled
by
waterspouts
which
destroyed
everything
they
passed
over
several
thousand
people
crushed
on
land
or
drowned
at
sea
such
were
the
traces
of
its
fury
left
by
this
devastating
tempest
it
surpassed
in
disasters
those
which
so
frightfully
ravaged
havana
and
guadalupe
one
on
the
25th
of
october
1810
the
other
on
the
26th
of
july
1825
but
while
so
many
catastrophes
were
taking
place
on
land
and
at
sea
a
drama
not
less
exciting
was
being
enacted
in
the
agitated
air
in
fact
a
balloon
as
a
ball
might
be
carried
on
the
summit
of
a
waterspout
had
been
taken
into
the
circling
movement
of
a
column
of
air
and
had
traversed
space
at
the
rate
of
ninety
miles
an
hour
turning
round
and
round
as
if
seized
by
some
aerial
maelstrom
beneath
the
lower
point
of
the
balloon
swung
a
car
containing
five
passengers
scarcely
visible
in
the
midst
of
the
thick
vapor
mingled
with
spray
which
hung
over
the
surface
of
the
ocean
whence
it
may
be
asked
had
come
that
plaything
of
the
tempest
from
what
part
of
the
world
did
it
rise
it
surely
could
not
have
started
during
the
storm
but
the
storm
had
raged
five
days
already
and
the
first
symptoms
were
manifested
on
the
18th
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
the
balloon
came
from
a
great
distance
for
it
could
not
have
traveled
less
than
two
thousand
miles
in
twentyfour
hours
at
any
rate
the
passengers
destitute
of
all
marks
for
their
guidance
could
not
have
possessed
the
means
of
reckoning
the
route
traversed
since
their
departure
it
was
a
remarkable
fact
that
although
in
the
very
midst
of
the
furious
tempest
they
did
not
suffer
from
it
they
were
thrown
about
and
whirled
round
and
round
without
feeling
the
rotation
in
the
slightest
degree
or
being
sensible
that
they
were
removed
from
a
horizontal
position
their
eyes
could
not
pierce
through
the
thick
mist
which
had
gathered
beneath
the
car
dark
vapor
was
all
around
them
such
was
the
density
of
the
atmosphere
that
they
could
not
be
certain
whether
it
was
day
or
night
no
reflection
of
light
no
sound
from
inhabited
land
no
roaring
of
the
ocean
could
have
reached
them
through
the
obscurity
while
suspended
in
those
elevated
zones
their
rapid
descent
alone
had
informed
them
of
the
dangers
which
they
ran
from
the
waves
however
the
balloon
lightened
of
heavy
articles
such
as
ammunition
arms
and
provisions
had
risen
into
the
higher
layers
of
the
atmosphere
to
a
height
of
4500
feet
the
voyagers
after
having
discovered
that
the
sea
extended
beneath
them
and
thinking
the
dangers
above
less
dreadful
than
those
below
did
not
hesitate
to
throw
overboard
even
their
most
useful
articles
while
they
endeavored
to
lose
no
more
of
that
fluid
the
life
of
their
enterprise
which
sustained
them
above
the
abyss
the
night
passed
in
the
midst
of
alarms
which
would
have
been
death
to
less
energetic
souls
again
the
day
appeared
and
with
it
the
tempest
began
to
moderate
from
the
beginning
of
that
day
the
24th
of
march
it
showed
symptoms
of
abating
at
dawn
some
of
the
lighter
clouds
had
risen
into
the
more
lofty
regions
of
the
air
in
a
few
hours
the
wind
had
changed
from
a
hurricane
to
a
fresh
breeze
that
is
to
say
the
rate
of
the
transit
of
the
atmospheric
layers
was
diminished
by
half
it
was
still
what
sailors
call
a
closereefed
topsail
breeze
but
the
commotion
in
the
elements
had
none
the
less
considerably
diminished
towards
eleven
oclock
the
lower
region
of
the
air
was
sensibly
clearer
the
atmosphere
threw
off
that
chilly
dampness
which
is
felt
after
the
passage
of
a
great
meteor
the
storm
did
not
seem
to
have
gone
farther
to
the
west
it
appeared
to
have
exhausted
itself
could
it
have
passed
away
in
electric
sheets
as
is
sometimes
the
case
with
regard
to
the
typhoons
of
the
indian
ocean
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
also
evident
that
the
balloon
was
again
slowly
descending
with
a
regular
movement
it
appeared
as
if
it
were
little
by
little
collapsing
and
that
its
case
was
lengthening
and
extending
passing
from
a
spherical
to
an
oval
form
towards
midday
the
balloon
was
hovering
above
the
sea
at
a
height
of
only
2000
feet
it
contained
50000
cubic
feet
of
gas
and
thanks
to
its
capacity
it
could
maintain
itself
a
long
time
in
the
air
although
it
should
reach
a
great
altitude
or
might
be
thrown
into
a
horizontal
position
perceiving
their
danger
the
passengers
cast
away
the
last
articles
which
still
weighed
down
the
car
the
few
provisions
they
had
kept
everything
even
to
their
pocketknives
and
one
of
them
having
hoisted
himself
on
to
the
circles
which
united
the
cords
of
the
net
tried
to
secure
more
firmly
the
lower
point
of
the
balloon
it
was
however
evident
to
the
voyagers
that
the
gas
was
failing
and
that
the
balloon
could
no
longer
be
sustained
in
the
higher
regions
they
must
infallibly
perish
there
was
not
a
continent
nor
even
an
island
visible
beneath
them
the
watery
expanse
did
not
present
a
single
speck
of
land
not
a
solid
surface
upon
which
their
anchor
could
hold
it
was
the
open
sea
whose
waves
were
still
dashing
with
tremendous
violence
it
was
the
ocean
without
any
visible
limits
even
for
those
whose
gaze
from
their
commanding
position
extended
over
a
radius
of
forty
miles
the
vast
liquid
plain
lashed
without
mercy
by
the
storm
appeared
as
if
covered
with
herds
of
furious
chargers
whose
white
and
disheveled
crests
were
streaming
in
the
wind
no
land
was
in
sight
not
a
solitary
ship
could
be
seen
it
was
necessary
at
any
cost
to
arrest
their
downward
course
and
to
prevent
the
balloon
from
being
engulfed
in
the
waves
the
voyagers
directed
all
their
energies
to
this
urgent
work
but
notwithstanding
their
efforts
the
balloon
still
fell
and
at
the
same
time
shifted
with
the
greatest
rapidity
following
the
direction
of
the
wind
that
is
to
say
from
the
northeast
to
the
southwest
frightful
indeed
was
the
situation
of
these
unfortunate
men
they
were
evidently
no
longer
masters
of
the
machine
all
their
attempts
were
useless
the
case
of
the
balloon
collapsed
more
and
more
the
gas
escaped
without
any
possibility
of
retaining
it
their
descent
was
visibly
accelerated
and
soon
after
midday
the
car
hung
within
600
feet
of
the
ocean
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
the
escape
of
gas
which
rushed
through
a
large
rent
in
the
silk
by
lightening
the
car
of
all
the
articles
which
it
contained
the
passengers
had
been
able
to
prolong
their
suspension
in
the
air
for
a
few
hours
but
the
inevitable
catastrophe
could
only
be
retarded
and
if
land
did
not
appear
before
night
voyagers
car
and
balloon
must
to
a
certainty
vanish
beneath
the
waves
they
now
resorted
to
the
only
remaining
expedient
they
were
truly
dauntless
men
who
knew
how
to
look
death
in
the
face
not
a
single
murmur
escaped
from
their
lips
they
were
determined
to
struggle
to
the
last
minute
to
do
anything
to
retard
their
fall
the
car
was
only
a
sort
of
willow
basket
unable
to
float
and
there
was
not
the
slightest
possibility
of
maintaining
it
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
two
more
hours
passed
and
the
balloon
was
scarcely
400
feet
above
the
water
at
that
moment
a
loud
voice
the
voice
of
a
man
whose
heart
was
inaccessible
to
fear
was
heard
to
this
voice
responded
others
not
less
determined
is
everything
thrown
out
no
here
are
still
2000
dollars
in
gold
a
heavy
bag
immediately
plunged
into
the
sea
does
the
balloon
rise
a
little
but
it
will
not
be
long
before
it
falls
again
what
still
remains
to
be
thrown
out
nothing
yes
the
car
let
us
catch
hold
of
the
net
and
into
the
sea
with
the
car
this
was
in
fact
the
last
and
only
mode
of
lightening
the
balloon
the
ropes
which
held
the
car
were
cut
and
the
balloon
after
its
fall
mounted
2000
feet
the
five
voyagers
had
hoisted
themselves
into
the
net
and
clung
to
the
meshes
gazing
at
the
abyss
the
delicate
sensibility
of
balloons
is
well
known
it
is
sufficient
to
throw
out
the
lightest
article
to
produce
a
difference
in
its
vertical
position
the
apparatus
in
the
air
is
like
a
balance
of
mathematical
precision
it
can
be
thus
easily
understood
that
when
it
is
lightened
of
any
considerable
weight
its
movement
will
be
impetuous
and
sudden
so
it
happened
on
this
occasion
but
after
being
suspended
for
an
instant
aloft
the
balloon
began
to
redescend
the
gas
escaping
by
the
rent
which
it
was
impossible
to
repair
the
men
had
done
all
that
men
could
do
no
human
efforts
could
save
them
now
they
must
trust
to
the
mercy
of
him
who
rules
the
elements
at
four
oclock
the
balloon
was
only
500
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
water
a
loud
barking
was
heard
a
dog
accompanied
the
voyagers
and
was
held
pressed
close
to
his
master
in
the
meshes
of
the
net
top
has
seen
something
cried
one
of
the
men
then
immediately
a
loud
voice
shouted
land
land
the
balloon
which
the
wind
still
drove
towards
the
southwest
had
since
daybreak
gone
a
considerable
distance
which
might
be
reckoned
by
hundreds
of
miles
and
a
tolerably
high
land
had
in
fact
appeared
in
that
direction
but
this
land
was
still
thirty
miles
off
it
would
not
take
less
than
an
hour
to
get
to
it
and
then
there
was
the
chance
of
falling
to
leeward
an
hour
might
not
the
balloon
before
that
be
emptied
of
all
the
fluid
it
yet
retained
such
was
the
terrible
question
the
voyagers
could
distinctly
see
that
solid
spot
which
they
must
reach
at
any
cost
they
were
ignorant
of
what
it
was
whether
an
island
or
a
continent
for
they
did
not
know
to
what
part
of
the
world
the
hurricane
had
driven
them
but
they
must
reach
this
land
whether
inhabited
or
desolate
whether
hospitable
or
not
it
was
evident
that
the
balloon
could
no
longer
support
itself
several
times
already
had
the
crests
of
the
enormous
billows
licked
the
bottom
of
the
net
making
it
still
heavier
and
the
balloon
only
half
rose
like
a
bird
with
a
wounded
wing
half
an
hour
later
the
land
was
not
more
than
a
mile
off
but
the
balloon
exhausted
flabby
hanging
in
great
folds
had
gas
in
its
upper
part
alone
the
voyagers
clinging
to
the
net
were
still
too
heavy
for
it
and
soon
half
plunged
into
the
sea
they
were
beaten
by
the
furious
waves
the
ballooncase
bulged
out
again
and
the
wind
taking
it
drove
it
along
like
a
vessel
might
it
not
possibly
thus
reach
the
land
but
when
only
two
fathoms
off
terrible
cries
resounded
from
four
pairs
of
lungs
at
once
the
balloon
which
had
appeared
as
if
it
would
never
again
rise
suddenly
made
an
unexpected
bound
after
having
been
struck
by
a
tremendous
sea
as
if
it
had
been
at
that
instant
relieved
of
a
new
part
of
its
weight
it
mounted
to
a
height
of
1500
feet
and
here
it
met
a
current
of
wind
which
instead
of
taking
it
directly
to
the
coast
carried
it
in
a
nearly
parallel
direction
at
last
two
minutes
later
it
reproached
obliquely
and
finally
fell
on
a
sandy
beach
out
of
the
reach
of
the
waves
the
voyagers
aiding
each
other
managed
to
disengage
themselves
from
the
meshes
of
the
net
the
balloon
relieved
of
their
weight
was
taken
by
the
wind
and
like
a
wounded
bird
which
revives
for
an
instant
disappeared
into
space
but
the
car
had
contained
five
passengers
with
a
dog
and
the
balloon
only
left
four
on
the
shore
the
missing
person
had
evidently
been
swept
off
by
the
sea
which
had
just
struck
the
net
and
it
was
owing
to
this
circumstance
that
the
lightened
balloon
rose
the
last
time
and
then
soon
after
reached
the
land
scarcely
had
the
four
castaways
set
foot
on
firm
ground
than
they
all
thinking
of
the
absent
one
simultaneously
exclaimed
perhaps
he
will
try
to
swim
to
land
let
us
save
him
let
us
save
him

those

neither

reserved
them
for

escaped
from

led
to

of
the
prisoners
were
as

that

year
in
the
month
of
february
1865
in

of

was
one
of
those

began
by
handling
the
hammer
and

like
generals

cyrus
harding
was
courage
personified
he
had
been
in
all
the
battles
of
that

who
said
i
never

hundreds
of
times
captain
harding
had
almost
been
among
those
who
were
not
counted
by
the
terrible
grant
but
in
these
combats
where
he
never
spared
himself
fortune
favored
him
till
the
moment
when
he
was
wounded
and
taken
prisoner
on
the
field
of
battle
near
richmond
at
the

time
and
on
the
same
day
another
important
personage
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
southerners
this
was
no
other
than
gideon
spilett
a
reporter
for
the
new

had
been
ordered
to
follow
the
changes
of
the
war
in
the
midst
of
the
northern
armies
gideon
spilett
was
one
of
that
race
of
indomitable
english
or
american
chroniclers
like
stanley
and
others
who
stop
at
nothing
to
obtain
exact
information
and
transmit
it
to
their
journal
in
the
shortest
possible
time
the
newspapers
of
the
union
such
as
the

are
genuine
powers
and
their
reporters
are
men
to
be
reckoned
with
gideon
spilett
ranked
among
the
first
of

reporters
a
man
of
great
merit
energetic
prompt

full
of

enthusiastic
in

resolute
in

sorts
of
curious
subjects
of
the
unpublished

was

of

write
under
fire

among
bullets
and
to
whom
every

the
wires
with
incessant
telegrams
like
those
who
speak
when
they
have
nothing
to
say
but
each
of
his
notes
short
decisive
and
clear
threw
light
on
some
important
point
besides
he
was
not
wanting
in
humor
it
was
he
who
after
the
affair
of
the
black
river
determined
at
any
cost
to
keep
his
place
at

was
rather
more
than
forty
years
of
age
light
whiskers
bordering
on
red
surrounded
his
face
his
eye
was
steady
lively
rapid
in
its
changes
it
was
the
eye
of
a

accustomed
to
take
in
at
a
glance
all
the
details
of
a
scene
well
built
he
was
inured

like
a

of

water
for
ten
years
gideon
spilett
had
been
the
reporter
of
the
new
york
herald
which
he
enriched
by
his
letters
and
drawings
for
he
was
as
skilful
in
the
use
of
the
pencil
as
of
the
pen
when
he
was
captured
he
was
in
the
act
of
making
a
description
and
sketch
of
the
battle
the
last
words
in
his
notebook
were
these

just
taken
aim
at

but
the
southerner
notwithstanding
missed
gideon
spilett
who
with
his
usual
fortune
came
out
of
this
affair
without
a
scratch
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
who
did
not
know
each
other
except
by
reputation
had
both
been
carried
to
richmond
the
engineers
wounds
rapidly
healed
and
it
was
during
his
convalescence
that
he
made
acquaintance
with
the
reporter
the
two
men
then
learned
to
appreciate
each
other
soon
their
common
aim
had
but
one
object
that
of
escaping
rejoining
grants
army
and
fighting
together
in
the
ranks
of
the
federals
the
two
americans
had
from
the
first
determined
to
seize
every
chance
but
although
they
were
allowed
to
wander
at
liberty
in
the
town
richmond
was
so
strictly
guarded
that
escape
appeared
impossible
in
the
meanwhile
captain
harding
was
rejoined
by
a
servant
who
was
devoted
to
him
in
life
and
in
death
this
intrepid
fellow
was
a
negro
born
on
the
engineers
estate
of
a
slave
father
and
mother
but
to
whom
cyrus
who
was
an
abolitionist
from
conviction
and
heart
had
long
since
given
his
freedom
the
once
slave
though
free
would
not
leave
his
master
he
would
have
died
for
him
he
was
a
man
of
about
thirty
vigorous
active
clever
intelligent
gentle
and
calm
sometimes
naive
always
merry
obliging
and
honest
his
name
was
nebuchadnezzar
but
he
only
answered
to
the
familiar
abbreviation
of
neb
when
neb
heard
that
his
master
had
been
made
prisoner
he
left
massachusetts
without
hesitating
an
instant
arrived
before
richmond
and
by
dint
of
stratagem
and
shrewdness
after
having
risked
his
life
twenty
times
over
managed
to
penetrate
into
the
besieged
town
the
pleasure
of
harding
on
seeing
his
servant
and
the
joy
of
neb
at
finding
his
master
can
scarcely
be
described
but
though
neb
had
been
able
to
make
his
way
into
richmond
it
was
quite
another
thing
to
get
out
again
for
the
northern
prisoners
were
very
strictly
watched
some
extraordinary
opportunity
was
needed
to
make
the
attempt
with
any
chance
of
success
and
this
opportunity
not
only
did
not
present
itself
but
was
very
difficult
to
find
meanwhile
grant
continued
his
energetic
operations
the
victory
of
petersburg
had
been
very
dearly
bought
his
forces
united
to
those
of
butler
had
as
yet
been
unsuccessful
before
richmond
and
nothing
gave
the
prisoners
any
hope
of
a
speedy
deliverance
the
reporter
to
whom
his
tedious
captivity
did
not
offer
a
single
incident
worthy
of
note
could
stand
it
no
longer
his
usually
active
mind
was
occupied
with
one
sole
thoughthow
he
might
get
out
of
richmond
at
any
cost
several
times
had
he
even
made
the
attempt
but
was
stopped
by
some
insurmountable
obstacle
however
the
siege
continued
and
if
the
prisoners
were
anxious
to
escape
and
join
grants
army
certain
of
the
besieged
were
no
less
anxious
to
join
the
southern
forces
among
them
was
one
jonathan
forster
a
determined
southerner
the
truth
was
that
if
the
prisoners
of
the
secessionists
could
not
leave
the
town
neither
could
the
secessionists
themselves
while
the
northern
army
invested
it
the
governor
of
richmond
for
a
long
time
had
been
unable
to
communicate
with
general
lee
and
he
very
much
wished
to
make
known
to
him
the
situation
of
the
town
so
as
to
hasten
the
march
of
the
army
to
their
relief
thus
jonathan
forster
accordingly
conceived
the
idea
of
rising
in
a
balloon
so
as
to
pass
over
the
besieging
lines
and
in
that
way
reach
the
secessionist
camp
the
governor
authorized
the
attempt
a
balloon
was
manufactured
and
placed
at
the
disposal
of
forster
who
was
to
be
accompanied
by
five
other
persons
they
were
furnished
with
arms
in
case
they
might
have
to
defend
themselves
when
they
alighted
and
provisions
in
the
event
of
their
aerial
voyage
being
prolonged
the
departure
of
the
balloon
was
fixed
for
the
18th
of
march
it
should
be
effected
during
the
night
with
a
northwest
wind
of
moderate
force
and
the
aeronauts
calculated
that
they
would
reach
general
lees
camp
in
a
few
hours
but
this
northwest
wind
was
not
a
simple
breeze
from
the
18th
it
was
evident
that
it
was
changing
to
a
hurricane
the
tempest
soon
became
such
that
forsters
departure
was
deferred
for
it
was
impossible
to
risk
the
balloon
and
those
whom
it
carried
in
the
midst
of
the
furious
elements
the
balloon
inflated
on
the
great
square
of
richmond
was
ready
to
depart
on
the
first
abatement
of
the
wind
and
as
may
be
supposed
the
impatience
among
the
besieged
to
see
the
storm
moderate
was
very
great
the
18th
the
19th
of
march
passed
without
any
alteration
in
the
weather
there
was
even
great
difficulty
in
keeping
the
balloon
fastened
to
the
ground
as
the
squalls
dashed
it
furiously
about
the
night
of
the
19th
passed
but
the
next
morning
the
storm
blew
with
redoubled
force
the
departure
of
the
balloon
was
impossible
on
that
day
the
engineer
cyrus
harding
was
accosted
in
one
of
the
streets
of
richmond
by
a
person
whom
he
did
not
in
the
least
know
this
was
a
sailor
named
pencroft
a
man
of
about
thirtyfive
or
forty
years
of
age
strongly
built
very
sunburnt
and
possessed
of
a
pair
of
bright
sparkling
eyes
and
a
remarkably
good
physiognomy
pencroft
was
an
american
from
the
north
who
had
sailed
all
the
ocean
over
and
who
had
gone
through
every
possible
and
almost
impossible
adventure
that
a
being
with
two
feet
and
no
wings
would
encounter
it
is
needless
to
say
that
he
was
a
bold
dashing
fellow
ready
to
dare
anything
and
was
astonished
at
nothing
pencroft
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
had
gone
to
richmond
on
business
with
a
young
boy
of
fifteen
from
new
jersey
son
of
a
former
captain
an
orphan
whom
he
loved
as
if
he
had
been
his
own
child
not
having
been
able
to
leave
the
town
before
the
first
operations
of
the
siege
he
found
himself
shut
up
to
his
great
disgust
but
not
accustomed
to
succumb
to
difficulties
he
resolved
to
escape
by
some
means
or
other
he
knew
the
engineerofficer
by
reputation
he
knew
with
what
impatience
that
determined
man
chafed
under
his
restraint
on
this
day
he
did
not
therefore
hesitate
to
accost
him
saying
without
circumlocution
have
you
had
enough
of
richmond
captain
the
engineer
looked
fixedly
at
the
man
who
spoke
and
who
added
in
a
low
voice
captain
harding
will
you
try
to
escape
when
asked
the
engineer
quickly
and
it
was
evident
that
this
question
was
uttered
without
consideration
for
he
had
not
yet
examined
the
stranger
who
addressed
him
but
after
having
with
a
penetrating
eye
observed
the
open
face
of
the
sailor
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
before
him
an
honest
man
who
are
you
he
asked
briefly
pencroft
made
himself
known
well
replied
harding
and
in
what
way
do
you
propose
to
escape
by
that
lazy
balloon
which
is
left
there
doing
nothing
and
which
looks
to
me
as
if
it
was
waiting
on
purpose
for
us
there
was
no
necessity
for
the
sailor
to
finish
his
sentence
the
engineer
understood
him
at
once
he
seized
pencroft
by
the
arm
and
dragged
him
to
his
house
there
the
sailor
developed
his
project
which
was
indeed
extremely
simple
they
risked
nothing
but
their
lives
in
its
execution
the
hurricane
was
in
all
its
violence
it
is
true
but
so
clever
and
daring
an
engineer
as
cyrus
harding
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
manage
a
balloon
had
he
himself
been
as
well
acquainted
with
the
art
of
sailing
in
the
air
as
he
was
with
the
navigation
of
a
ship
pencroft
would
not
have
hesitated
to
set
out
of
course
taking
his
young
friend
herbert
with
him
for
accustomed
to
brave
the
fiercest
tempests
of
the
ocean
he
was
not
to
be
hindered
on
account
of
the
hurricane
captain
harding
had
listened
to
the
sailor
without
saying
a
word
but
his
eyes
shone
with
satisfaction
here
was
the
longsoughtfor
opportunityhe
was
not
a
man
to
let
it
pass
the
plan
was
feasible
though
it
must
be
confessed
dangerous
in
the
extreme
in
the
night
in
spite
of
their
guards
they
might
approach
the
balloon
slip
into
the
car
and
then
cut
the
cords
which
held
it
there
was
no
doubt
that
they
might
be
killed
but
on
the
other
hand
they
might
succeed
and
without
this
stormwithout
this
storm
the
balloon
would
have
started
already
and
the
lookedfor
opportunity
would
not
have
then
presented
itself
i
am
not
alone
said
harding
at
last
how
many
people
do
you
wish
to
bring
with
you
asked
the
sailor
two
my
friend
spilett
and
my
servant
neb
that
will
be
three
replied
pencroft
and
with
herbert
and
me
five
but
the
balloon
will
hold
six
that
will
be
enough
we
will
go
answered
harding
in
a
firm
voice
this
we
included
spilett
for
the
reporter
as
his
friend
well
knew
was
not
a
man
to
draw
back
and
when
the
project
was
communicated
to
him
he
approved
of
it
unreservedly
what
astonished
him
was
that
so
simple
an
idea
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
as
to
neb
he
followed
his
master
wherever
his
master
wished
to
go
this
evening
then
said
pencroft
we
will
all
meet
out
there
this
evening
at
ten
oclock
replied
captain
harding
and
heaven
grant
that
the
storm
does
not
abate
before
our
departure
pencroft
took
leave
of
the
two
friends
and
returned
to
his
lodging
where
young
herbert
brown
had
remained
the
courageous
boy
knew
of
the
sailors
plan
and
it
was
not
without
anxiety
that
he
awaited
the
result
of
the
proposal
being
made
to
the
engineer
thus
five
determined
persons
were
about
to
abandon
themselves
to
the
mercy
of
the
tempestuous
elements
no
the
storm
did
not
abate
and
neither
jonathan
forster
nor
his
companions
dreamed
of
confronting
it
in
that
frail
car
it
would
be
a
terrible
journey
the
engineer
only
feared
one
thing
it
was
that
the
balloon
held
to
the
ground
and
dashed
about
by
the
wind
would
be
torn
into
shreds
for
several
hours
he
roamed
round
the
nearlydeserted
square
surveying
the
apparatus
pencroft
did
the
same
on
his
side
his
hands
in
his
pockets
yawning
now
and
then
like
a
man
who
did
not
know
how
to
kill
the
time
but
really
dreading
like
his
friend
either
the
escape
or
destruction
of
the
balloon
evening
arrived
the
night
was
dark
in
the
extreme
thick
mists
passed
like
clouds
close
to
the
ground
rain
fell
mingled
with
snow
it
was
very
cold
a
mist
hung
over
richmond
it
seemed
as
if
the
violent
storm
had
produced
a
truce
between
the
besiegers
and
the
besieged
and
that
the
cannon
were
silenced
by
the
louder
detonations
of
the
storm
the
streets
of
the
town
were
deserted
it
had
not
even
appeared
necessary
in
that
horrible
weather
to
place
a
guard
in
the
square
in
the
midst
of
which
plunged
the
balloon
everything
favored
the
departure
of
the
prisoners
but
what
might
possibly
be
the
termination
of
the
hazardous
voyage
they
contemplated
in
the
midst
of
the
furious
elements
dirty
weather
exclaimed
pencroft
fixing
his
hat
firmly
on
his
head
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
but
pshaw
we
shall
succeed
all
the
same
at
halfpast
nine
harding
and
his
companions
glided
from
different
directions
into
the
square
which
the
gaslamps
extinguished
by
the
wind
had
left
in
total
obscurity
even
the
enormous
balloon
almost
beaten
to
the
ground
could
not
be
seen
independently
of
the
sacks
of
ballast
to
which
the
cords
of
the
net
were
fastened
the
car
was
held
by
a
strong
cable
passed
through
a
ring
in
the
pavement
the
five
prisoners
met
by
the
car
they
had
not
been
perceived
and
such
was
the
darkness
that
they
could
not
even
see
each
other
without
speaking
a
word
harding
spilett
neb
and
herbert
took
their
places
in
the
car
while
pencroft
by
the
engineers
order
detached
successively
the
bags
of
ballast
it
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
only
and
the
sailor
rejoined
his
companions
the
balloon
was
then
only
held
by
the
cable
and
the
engineer
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
give
the
word
at
that
moment
a
dog
sprang
with
a
bound
into
the
car
it
was
top
a
favorite
of
the
engineer
the
faithful
creature
having
broken
his
chain
had
followed
his
master
he
however
fearing
that
its
additional
weight
might
impede
their
ascent
wished
to
send
away
the
animal
one
more
will
make
but
little
difference
poor
beast
exclaimed
pencroft
heaving
out
two
bags
of
sand
and
as
he
spoke
letting
go
the
cable
the
balloon
ascending
in
an
oblique
direction
disappeared
after
having
dashed
the
car
against
two
chimneys
which
it
threw
down
as
it
swept
by
them
then
indeed
the
full
rage
of
the
hurricane
was
exhibited
to
the
voyagers
during
the
night
the
engineer
could
not
dream
of
descending
and
when
day
broke
even
a
glimpse
of
the
earth
below
was
intercepted
by
fog
five
days
had
passed
when
a
partial
clearing
allowed
them
to
see
the
wide
extending
ocean
beneath
their
feet
now
lashed
into
the
maddest
fury
by
the
gale
our
readers
will
recollect
what
befell
these
five
daring
individuals
who
set
out
on
their
hazardous
expedition
in
the
balloon
on
the
20th
of
march
five
days
afterwards
four
of
them
were
thrown
on
a
desert
coast
seven
thousand
miles
from
their
country
but
one
of
their
number
was
missing
the
man
who
was
to
be
their
guide
their
leading
spirit
the
engineer
captain
harding
the
instant
they
had
recovered
their
feet
they
all
hurried
to
the
beach
in
the
hopes
of
rendering
him
assistance

the

the

off
by

wave
his

the

cried
the

all

spilett
herbert
pencroft
and
neb
forgetting
their
fatigue
began
their
search
poor
neb
shed
bitter
tears
giving
way
to
despair
at
the
thought
of
having
lost
the
only
being
he
loved
on
earth
only
two
minutes
had
passed
from
the
time
when
cyrus
harding
disappeared
to
the
moment
when
his
companions
set
foot
on
the
ground
they
had
hopes
therefore
of
arriving
in
time
to
save
him
let
us
look
for
him
let
us
look
for

cried
neb
yes
neb
replied
gideon
spilett
and
we
will
find
him
too
living
i
trust
still
living
can
he
swim
asked
pencroft
yes
replied
neb
and
besides
top
is
there
the
sailor
observing
the
heavy
surf
on
the
shore
shook
his
head
the
engineer
had
disappeared
to
the
north
of
the
shore
and
nearly
half
a
mile
from
the
place
where
the
castaways
had
landed
the
nearest
point
of
the
beach
he
could
reach
was
thus
fully
that
distance
off
it
was
then
nearly
six
oclock
a
thick
fog
made
the
night
very
dark
the
castaways
proceeded
toward
the
north
of
the
land
on
which
chance
had
thrown
them
an
unknown
region
the
geographical
situation
of
which
they
could
not
even
guess
they
were
walking
upon
a
sandy
soil
mingled
with
stones
which
appeared
destitute
of
any
sort
of
vegetation
the
ground
very
unequal
and
rough
was
in
some
places
perfectly
riddled
with
holes
making
walking
extremely
painful
from
these
holes
escaped
every
minute
great
birds
of
clumsy
flight
which
flew
in
all
directions
others
more
active
rose
in
flocks
and
passed
in
clouds
over
their
heads
the
sailor
thought
he
recognized
gulls
and
cormorants
whose
shrill
cries
rose
above
the
roaring
of
the
sea
from
time
to
time
the
castaways
stopped
and
shouted
then
listened
for
some
response
from
the
ocean
for
they
thought
that
if
the
engineer
had
landed
and
they
had
been
near
to
the
place
they
would
have
heard
the
barking
of
the
dog
top
even
should
harding
himself
have
been
unable
to
give
any
sign
of
existence
they
stopped
to
listen
but
no
sound
arose
above
the
roaring
of
the
waves
and
the
dashing
of
the
surf
the
little
band
then
continued
their
march
forward
searching
into
every
hollow
of
the
shore
after
walking
for
twenty
minutes
the
four
castaways
were
suddenly
brought
to
a
standstill
by
the
sight
of
foaming
billows
close
to
their
feet
the
solid
ground
ended
here
they
found
themselves
at
the
extremity
of
a
sharp
point
on
which
the
sea
broke
furiously
it
is
a
promontory
said
the
sailor
we
must
retrace
our
steps
holding
towards
the
right
and
we
shall
thus
gain
the
mainland
but
if
he
is
there
said
neb
pointing
to
the
ocean
whose
waves
shone
of
a
snowy
white
in
the
darkness
well
let
us
call
again
and
all
uniting
their
voices
they
gave
a
vigorous
shout
but
there
came
no
reply
they
waited
for
a
lull
then
began
again
still
no
reply
the
castaways
accordingly
returned
following
the
opposite
side
of
the
promontory
over
a
soil
equally
sandy
and
rugged
however
pencroft
observed
that
the
shore
was
more
equal
that
the
ground
rose
and
he
declared
that
it
was
joined
by
a
long
slope
to
a
hill
whose
massive
front
he
thought
that
he
could
see
looming
indistinctly
through
the
mist
the
birds
were
less
numerous
on
this
part
of
the
shore
the
sea
was
also
less
tumultuous
and
they
observed
that
the
agitation
of
the
waves
was
diminished
the
noise
of
the
surf
was
scarcely
heard
this
side
of
the
promontory
evidently
formed
a
semicircular
bay
which
the
sharp
point
sheltered
from
the
breakers
of
the
open
sea
but
to
follow
this
direction
was
to
go
south
exactly
opposite
to
that
part
of
the
coast
where
harding
might
have
landed
after
a
walk
of
a
mile
and
a
half
the
shore
presented
no
curve
which
would
permit
them
to
return
to
the
north
this
promontory
of
which
they
had
turned
the
point
must
be
attached
to
the
mainland
the
castaways
although
their
strength
was
nearly
exhausted
still
marched
courageously
forward
hoping
every
moment
to
meet
with
a
sudden
angle
which
would
set
them
in
the
first
direction
what
was
their
disappointment
when
after
trudging
nearly
two
miles
having
reached
an
elevated
point
composed
of
slippery
rocks
they
found
themselves
again
stopped
by
the
sea
we
are
on
an
islet
said
pencroft
and
we
have
surveyed
it
from
one
extremity
to
the
other
the
sailor
was
right
they
had
been
thrown
not
on
a
continent
not
even
on
an
island
but
on
an
islet
which
was
not
more
than
two
miles
in
length
with
even
a
less
breadth
was
this
barren
spot
the
desolate
refuge
of
seabirds
strewn
with
stones
and
destitute
of
vegetation
attached
to
a
more
important
archipelago
it
was
impossible
to
say
when
the
voyagers
from
their
car
saw
the
land
through
the
mist
they
had
not
been
able
to
reconnoiter
it
sufficiently
however
pencroft
accustomed
with
his
sailor
eyes
to
piece
through
the
gloom
was
almost
certain
that
he
could
clearly
distinguish
in
the
west
confused
masses
which
indicated
an
elevated
coast
but
they
could
not
in
the
dark
determine
whether
it
was
a
single
island
or
connected
with
others
they
could
not
leave
it
either
as
the
sea
surrounded
them
they
must
therefore
put
off
till
the
next
day
their
search
for
the
engineer
from
whom
alas
not
a
single
cry
had
reached
them
to
show
that
he
was
still
in
existence
the
silence
of
our
friend
proves
nothing
said
the
reporter
perhaps
he
has
fainted
or
is
wounded
and
unable
to
reply
directly
so
we
will
not
despair
the
reporter
then
proposed
to
light
a
fire
on
a
point
of
the
islet
which
would
serve
as
a
signal
to
the
engineer
but
they
searched
in
vain
for
wood
or
dry
brambles
nothing
but
sand
and
stones
were
to
be
found
the
grief
of
neb
and
his
companions
who
were
all
strongly
attached
to
the
intrepid
harding
can
be
better
pictured
than
described
it
was
too
evident
that
they
were
powerless
to
help
him
they
must
wait
with
what
patience
they
could
for
daylight
either
the
engineer
had
been
able
to
save
himself
and
had
already
found
a
refuge
on
some
point
of
the
coast
or
he
was
lost
for
ever
the
long
and
painful
hours
passed
by
the
cold
was
intense
the
castaways
suffered
cruelly
but
they
scarcely
perceived
it
they
did
not
even
think
of
taking
a
minutes
rest
forgetting
everything
but
their
chief
hoping
or
wishing
to
hope
on
they
continued
to
walk
up
and
down
on
this
sterile
spot
always
returning
to
its
northern
point
where
they
could
approach
nearest
to
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
they
listened
they
called
and
then
uniting
their
voices
they
endeavored
to
raise
even
a
louder
shout
than
before
which
would
be
transmitted
to
a
great
distance
the
wind
had
now
fallen
almost
to
a
calm
and
the
noise
of
the
sea
began
also
to
subside
one
of
nebs
shouts
even
appeared
to
produce
an
echo
herbert
directed
pencrofts
attention
to
it
adding
that
proves
that
there
is
a
coast
to
the
west
at
no
great
distance
the
sailor
nodded
besides
his
eyes
could
not
deceive
him
if
he
had
discovered
land
however
indistinct
it
might
appear
land
was
sure
to
be
there
but
that
distant
echo
was
the
only
response
produced
by
nebs
shouts
while
a
heavy
gloom
hung
over
all
the
part
east
of
the
island
meanwhile
the
sky
was
clearing
little
by
little
towards
midnight
the
stars
shone
out
and
if
the
engineer
had
been
there
with
his
companions
he
would
have
remarked
that
these
stars
did
not
belong
to
the
northern
hemisphere
the
polar
star
was
not
visible
the
constellations
were
not
those
which
they
had
been
accustomed
to
see
in
the
united
states
the
southern
cross
glittered
brightly
in
the
sky
the
night
passed
away
towards
five
oclock
in
the
morning
of
the
25th
of
march
the
sky
began
to
lighten
the
horizon
still
remained
dark
but
with
daybreak
a
thick
mist
rose
from
the
sea
so
that
the
eye
could
scarcely
penetrate
beyond
twenty
feet
or
so
from
where
they
stood
at
length
the
fog
gradually
unrolled
itself
in
great
heavily
moving
waves
it
was
unfortunate
however
that
the
castaways
could
distinguish
nothing
around
them
while
the
gaze
of
the
reporter
and
neb
were
cast
upon
the
ocean
the
sailor
and
herbert
looked
eagerly
for
the
coast
in
the
west
but
not
a
speck
of
land
was
visible
never
mind
said
pencroft
though
i
do
not
see
the
land
i
feel
it
it
is
there
there
as
sure
as
the
fact
that
we
are
no
longer
at
richmond
but
the
fog
was
not
long
in
rising
it
was
only
a
fineweather
mist
a
hot
sun
soon
penetrated
to
the
surface
of
the
island
about
halfpast
six
threequarters
of
an
hour
after
sunrise
the
mist
became
more
transparent
it
grew
thicker
above
but
cleared
away
below
soon
the
isle
appeared
as
if
it
had
descended
from
a
cloud
then
the
sea
showed
itself
around
them
spreading
far
away
towards
the
east
but
bounded
on
the
west
by
an
abrupt
and
precipitous
coast
yes
the
land
was
there
their
safety
was
at
least
provisionally
insured
the
islet
and
the
coast
were
separated
by
a
channel
about
half
a
mile
in
breadth
through
which
rushed
an
extremely
rapid
current
however
one
of
the
castaways
following
the
impulse
of
his
heart
immediately
threw
himself
into
the
current
without
consulting
his
companions
without
saying
a
single
word
it
was
neb
he
was
in
haste
to
be
on
the
other
side
and
to
climb
towards
the
north
it
had
been
impossible
to
hold
him
back
pencroft
called
him
in
vain
the
reporter
prepared
to
follow
him
but
pencroft
stopped
him
do
you
want
to
cross
the
channel
he
asked
yes
replied
spilett
all
right
said
the
seaman
wait
a
bit
neb
is
well
able
to
carry
help
to
his
master
if
we
venture
into
the
channel
we
risk
being
carried
into
the
open
sea
by
the
current
which
is
running
very
strong
but
if
im
not
wrong
it
is
ebbing
see
the
tide
is
going
down
over
the
sand
let
us
have
patience
and
at
low
water
it
is
possible
we
may
find
a
fordable
passage
you
are
right
replied
the
reporter
we
will
not
separate
more
than
we
can
help
during
this
time
neb
was
struggling
vigorously
against
the
current
he
was
crossing
in
an
oblique
direction
his
black
shoulders
could
be
seen
emerging
at
each
stroke
he
was
carried
down
very
quickly
but
he
also
made
way
towards
the
shore
it
took
more
than
half
an
hour
to
cross
from
the
islet
to
the
land
and
he
reached
the
shore
several
hundred
feet
from
the
place
which
was
opposite
to
the
point
from
which
he
had
started
landing
at
the
foot
of
a
high
wall
of
granite
he
shook
himself
vigorously
and
then
setting
off
running
soon
disappeared
behind
a
rocky
point
which
projected
to
nearly
the
height
of
the
northern
extremity
of
the
islet
nebs
companions
had
watched
his
daring
attempt
with
painful
anxiety
and
when
he
was
out
of
sight
they
fixed
their
attention
on
the
land
where
their
hope
of
safety
lay
while
eating
some
shellfish
with
which
the
sand
was
strewn
it
was
a
wretched
repast
but
still
it
was
better
than
nothing
the
opposite
coast
formed
one
vast
bay
terminating
on
the
south
by
a
very
sharp
point
which
was
destitute
of
all
vegetation
and
was
of
a
very
wild
aspect
this
point
abutted
on
the
shore
in
a
grotesque
outline
of
high
granite
rocks
towards
the
north
on
the
contrary
the
bay
widened
and
a
more
rounded
coast
appeared
trending
from
the
southwest
to
the
northeast
and
terminating
in
a
slender
cape
the
distance
between
these
two
extremities
which
made
the
bow
of
the
bay
was
about
eight
miles
half
a
mile
from
the
shore
rose
the
islet
which
somewhat
resembled
the
carcass
of
a
gigantic
whale
its
extreme
breadth
was
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
opposite
the
islet
the
beach
consisted
first
of
sand
covered
with
black
stones
which
were
now
appearing
little
by
little
above
the
retreating
tide
the
second
level
was
separated
by
a
perpendicular
granite
cliff
terminated
at
the
top
by
an
unequal
edge
at
a
height
of
at
least
300
feet
it
continued
thus
for
a
length
of
three
miles
ending
suddenly
on
the
right
with
a
precipice
which
looked
as
if
cut
by
the
hand
of
man
on
the
left
above
the
promontory
this
irregular
and
jagged
cliff
descended
by
a
long
slope
of
conglomerated
rocks
till
it
mingled
with
the
ground
of
the
southern
point
on
the
upper
plateau
of
the
coast
not
a
tree
appeared
it
was
a
flat
tableland
like
that
above
cape
town
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
but
of
reduced
proportions
at
least
so
it
appeared
seen
from
the
islet
however
verdure
was
not
wanting
to
the
right
beyond
the
precipice
they
could
easily
distinguish
a
confused
mass
of
great
trees
which
extended
beyond
the
limits
of
their
view
this
verdure
relieved
the
eye
so
long
wearied
by
the
continued
ranges
of
granite
lastly
beyond
and
above
the
plateau
in
a
northwesterly
direction
and
at
a
distance
of
at
least
seven
miles
glittered
a
white
summit
which
reflected
the
suns
rays
it
was
that
of
a
lofty
mountain
capped
with
snow
the
question
could
not
at
present
be
decided
whether
this
land
formed
an
island
or
whether
it
belonged
to
a
continent
but
on
beholding
the
convulsed
masses
heaped
up
on
the
left
no
geologist
would
have
hesitated
to
give
them
a
volcanic
origin
for
they
were
unquestionably
the
work
of
subterranean
convulsions
gideon
spilett
pencroft
and
herbert
attentively
examined
this
land
on
which
they
might
perhaps
have
to
live
many
long
years
on
which
indeed
they
might
even
die
should
it
be
out
of
the
usual
track
of
vessels
as
was
likely
to
be
the
case
well
asked
herbert
what
do
you
say
pencroft
there
is
some
good
and
some
bad
as
in
everything
replied
the
sailor
we
shall
see
but
now
the
ebb
is
evidently
making
in
three
hours
we
will
attempt
the
passage
and
once
on
the
other
side
we
will
try
to
get
out
of
this
scrape
and
i
hope
may
find
the
captain
pencroft
was
not
wrong
in
his
anticipations
three
hours
later
at
low
tide
the
greater
part
of
the
sand
forming
the
bed
of
the
channel
was
uncovered
between
the
islet
and
the
coast
there
only
remained
a
narrow
channel
which
would
no
doubt
be
easy
to
cross
about
ten
oclock
gideon
spilett
and
his
companions
stripped
themselves
of
their
clothes
which
they
placed
in
bundles
on
their
heads
and
then
ventured
into
the
water
which
was
not
more
than
five
feet
deep
herbert
for
whom
it
was
too
deep
swam
like
a
fish
and
got
through
capitally
all
three
arrived
without
difficulty
on
the
opposite
shore
quickly
drying
themselves
in
the
sun
they
put
on
their
clothes
which
they
had
preserved
from
contact
with
the
water
and
sat
down
to
take
counsel
together
what
to
do

all
at
once
the
reporter
sprang
up
and
telling
the
sailor
that
he
would
rejoin
them
at
that
same
place
he
climbed
the
cliff
in
the
direction
which
the
negro
neb
had
taken
a
few
hours
before
anxiety
hastened
his
steps
for
he
longed
to
obtain
news
of
his
friend
and
he
soon
disappeared
round
an
angle
of
the
cliff
herbert
wished
to
accompany
him
stop
here
my
boy
said
the
sailor
we
have
to
prepare
an
encampment
and
to
try
and
find
rather
better
grub
than
these
shellfish
our
friends
will
want
something
when
they
come
back
there
is
work
for
everybody
i
am
ready
replied
herbert
all
right
said
the
sailor
that
will
do
we
must
set
about
it
regularly
we
are
tired
cold
and
hungry
therefore
we
must
have
shelter
fire
and
food
there
is
wood
in
the
forest
and
eggs
in
nests
we
have
only
to
find
a
house
very
well
returned
herbert
i
will
look
for
a
cave
among
the
rocks
and
i
shall
be
sure
to
discover
some
hole
into
which
we
can
creep
all
right
said
pencroft
go
on
my
boy
they
both
walked
to
the
foot
of
the
enormous
wall
over
the
beach
far
from
which
the
tide
had
now
retreated
but
instead
of
going
towards
the
north
they
went
southward
pencroft
had
remarked
several
hundred
feet
from
the
place
at
which
they
landed
a
narrow
cutting
out
of
which
he
thought
a
river
or
stream
might
issue
now
on
the
one
hand
it
was
important
to
settle
themselves
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
good
stream
of
water
and
on
the
other
it
was
possible
that
the
current
had
thrown
cyrus
harding
on
the
shore
there
the
cliff
as
has
been
said
rose
to
a
height
of
three
hundred
feet
but
the
mass
was
unbroken
throughout
and
even
at
its
base
scarcely
washed
by
the
sea
it
did
not
offer
the
smallest
fissure
which
would
serve
as
a
dwelling
it
was
a
perpendicular
wall
of
very
hard
granite
which
even
the
waves
had
not
worn
away
towards
the
summit
fluttered
myriads
of
seafowl
and
especially
those
of
the
webfooted
species
with
long
flat
pointed
beaksa
clamorous
tribe
bold
in
the
presence
of
man
who
probably
for
the
first
time
thus
invaded
their
domains
pencroft
recognized
the
skua
and
other
gulls
among
them
the
voracious
little
seamew
which
in
great
numbers
nestled
in
the
crevices
of
the
granite
a
shot
fired
among
this
swarm
would
have
killed
a
great
number
but
to
fire
a
shot
a
gun
was
needed
and
neither
pencroft
nor
herbert
had
one
besides
this
gulls
and
seamews
are
scarcely
eatable
and
even
their
eggs
have
a
detestable
taste
however
herbert
who
had
gone
forward
a
little
more
to
the
left
soon
came
upon
rocks
covered
with
seaweed
which
some
hours
later
would
be
hidden
by
the
high
tide
on
these
rocks
in
the
midst
of
slippery
wrack
abounded
bivalve
shellfish
not
to
be
despised
by
starving
people
herbert
called
pencroft
who
ran
up
hastily
here
are
mussels
cried
the
sailor
these
will
do
instead
of
eggs
they
are
not
mussels
replied
herbert
who
was
attentively
examining
the
molluscs
attached
to
the
rocks
they
are
lithodomes
are
they
good
to
eat
asked
pencroft
perfectly
so
then
let
us
eat
some
lithodomes
the
sailor
could
rely
upon
herbert
the
young
boy
was
well
up
in
natural
history
and
always
had
had
quite
a
passion
for
the
science
his
father
had
encouraged
him
in
it
by
letting
him
attend
the
lectures
of
the
best
professors
in
boston
who
were
very
fond
of
the
intelligent
industrious
lad
and
his
turn
for
natural
history
was
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
time
of
great
use
and
he
was
not
mistaken
in
this
instance
these
lithodomes
were
oblong
shells
suspended
in
clusters
and
adhering
very
tightly
to
the
rocks
they
belong
to
that
species
of
molluscous
perforators
which
excavate
holes
in
the
hardest
stone
their
shell
is
rounded
at
both
ends
a
feature
which
is
not
remarked
in
the
common
mussel
pencroft
and
herbert
made
a
good
meal
of
the
lithodomes
which
were
then
half
opened
to
the
sun
they
ate
them
as
oysters
and
as
they
had
a
strong
peppery
taste
they
were
palatable
without
condiments
of
any
sort
their
hunger
was
thus
appeased
for
the
time
but
not
their
thirst
which
increased
after
eating
these
naturallyspiced
molluscs
they
had
then
to
find
fresh
water
and
it
was
not
likely
that
it
would
be
wanting
in
such
a
capriciously
uneven
region
pencroft
and
herbert
after
having
taken
the
precaution
of
collecting
an
ample
supply
of
lithodomes
with
which
they
filled
their
pockets
and
handkerchiefs
regained
the
foot
of
the
cliff
two
hundred
paces
farther
they
arrived
at
the
cutting
through
which
as
pencroft
had
guessed
ran
a
stream
of
water
whether
fresh
or
not
was
to
be
ascertained
at
this
place
the
wall
appeared
to
have
been
separated
by
some
violent
subterranean
force
at
its
base
was
hollowed
out
a
little
creek
the
farthest
part
of
which
formed
a
tolerably
sharp
angle
the
watercourse
at
that
part
measured
one
hundred
feet
in
breadth
and
its
two
banks
on
each
side
were
scarcely
twenty
feet
high
the
river
became
strong
almost
directly
between
the
two
walls
of
granite
which
began
to
sink
above
the
mouth
it
then
suddenly
turned
and
disappeared
beneath
a
wood
of
stunted
trees
half
a
mile
off
here
is
the
water
and
yonder
is
the
wood
we
require
said
pencroft
well
herbert
now
we
only
want
the
house
the
water
of
the
river
was
limpid
the
sailor
ascertained
that
at
this
timethat
is
to
say
at
low
tide
when
the
rising
floods
did
not
reach
itit
was
sweet
this
important
point
established
herbert
looked
for
some
cavity
which
would
serve
them
as
a
retreat
but
in
vain
everywhere
the
wall
appeared
smooth
plain
and
perpendicular
however
at
the
mouth
of
the
watercourse
and
above
the
reach
of
the
high
tide
the
convulsions
of
nature
had
formed
not
a
grotto
but
a
pile
of
enormous
rocks
such
as
are
often
met
with
in
granite
countries
and
which
bear
the
name
of
chimneys
pencroft
and
herbert
penetrated
quite
far
in
among
the
rocks
by
sandy
passages
in
which
light
was
not
wanting
for
it
entered
through
the
openings
which
were
left
between
the
blocks
of
which
some
were
only
sustained
by
a
miracle
of
equilibrium
but
with
the
light
came
also
aira
regular
corridorgaleand
with
the
wind
the
sharp
cold
from
the
exterior
however
the
sailor
thought
that
by
stoppingup
some
of
the
openings
with
a
mixture
of
stones
and
sand
the
chimneys
could
be
rendered
habitable
their
geometrical
plan
represented
the
typographical
sign

which
signifies
et
cetera
abridged
but
by
isolating
the
upper
mouth
of
the
sign
through
which
the
south
and
west
winds
blew
so
strongly
they
could
succeed
in
making
the
lower
part
of
use
heres
our
work
said
pencroft
and
if
we
ever
see
captain
harding
again
he
will
know
how
to
make
something
of
this
labyrinth
we
shall
see
him
again
pencroft
cried
herbert
and
when
he
returns
he
must
find
a
tolerable
dwelling
here
it
will
be
so
if
we
can
make
a
fireplace
in
the
left
passage
and
keep
an
opening
for
the
smoke
so
we
can
my
boy
replied
the
sailor
and
these
chimneys
will
serve
our
turn
let
us
set
to
work
but
first
come
and
get
a
store
of
fuel
i
think
some
branches
will
be
very
useful
in
stopping
up
these
openings
through
which
the
wind
shrieks
like
so
many
fiends
herbert
and
pencroft
left
the
chimneys
and
turning
the
angle
they
began
to
climb
the
left
bank
of
the
river
the
current
here
was
quite
rapid
and
drifted
down
some
dead
wood
the
rising
tideand
it
could
already
be
perceivedmust
drive
it
back
with
force
to
a
considerable
distance
the
sailor
then
thought
that
they
could
utilize
this
ebb
and
flow
for
the
transport
of
heavy
objects
after
having
walked
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
sailor
and
the
boy
arrived
at
the
angle
which
the
river
made
in
turning
towards
the
left
from
this
point
its
course
was
pursued
through
a
forest
of
magnificent
trees
these
trees
still
retained
their
verdure
notwithstanding
the
advanced
season
for
they
belonged
to
the
family
of
coniferae
which
is
spread
over
all
the
regions
of
the
globe
from
northern
climates
to
the
tropics
the
young
naturalist
recognized
especially
the
deedara
which
are
very
numerous
in
the
himalayan
zone
and
which
spread
around
them
a
most
agreeable
odor
between
these
beautiful
trees
sprang
up
clusters
of
firs
whose
opaque
open
parasol
boughs
spread
wide
around
among
the
long
grass
pencroft
felt
that
his
feet
were
crushing
dry
branches
which
crackled
like
fireworks
well
my
boy
said
he
to
herbert
if
i
dont
know
the
name
of
these
trees
at
any
rate
i
reckon
that
we
may
call
them
burning
wood
and
just
now
thats
the
chief
thing
we
want
let
us
get
a
supply
replied
herbert
who
immediately
set
to
work
the
collection
was
easily
made
it
was
not
even
necessary
to
lop
the
trees
for
enormous
quantities
of
dead
wood
were
lying
at
their
feet
but
if
fuel
was
not
wanting
the
means
of
transporting
it
was
not
yet
found
the
wood
being
very
dry
would
burn
rapidly
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
carry
to
the
chimneys
a
considerable
quantity
and
the
loads
of
two
men
would
not
be
sufficient
herbert
remarked
this
well
my
boy
replied
the
sailor
there
must
be
some
way
of
carrying
this
wood
there
is
always
a
way
of
doing
everything
if
we
had
a
cart
or
a
boat
it
would
be
easy
enough
but
we
have
the
river
said
herbert
right
replied
pencroft
the
river
will
be
to
us
like
a
road
which
carries
of
itself
and
rafts
have
not
been
invented
for
nothing
only
observed
herbert
at
this
moment
our
road
is
going
the
wrong
way
for
the
tide
is
rising
we
shall
be
all
right
if
we
wait
till
it
ebbs
replied
the
sailor
and
then
we
will
trust
it
to
carry
our
fuel
to
the
chimneys
let
us
get
the
raft
ready
the
sailor
followed
by
herbert
directed
his
steps
towards
the
river
they
both
carried
each
in
proportion
to
his
strength
a
load
of
wood
bound
in
fagots
they
found
on
the
bank
also
a
great
quantity
of
dead
branches
in
the
midst
of
grass
among
which
the
foot
of
man
had
probably
never
before
trod
pencroft
began
directly
to
make
his
raft
in
a
kind
of
little
bay
created
by
a
point
of
the
shore
which
broke
the
current
the
sailor
and
the
lad
placed
some
goodsized
pieces
of
wood
which
they
had
fastened
together
with
dry
creepers
a
raft
was
thus
formed
on
which
they
stacked
all
they
had
collected
sufficient
indeed
to
have
loaded
at
least
twenty
men
in
an
hour
the
work
was
finished
and
the
raft
moored
to
the
bank
awaited
the
turning
of
the
tide
there
were
still
several
hours
to
be
occupied
and
with
one
consent
pencroft
and
herbert
resolved
to
gain
the
upper
plateau
so
as
to
have
a
more
extended
view
of
the
surrounding
country
exactly
two
hundred
feet
behind
the
angle
formed
by
the
river
the
wall
terminated
by
a
fall
of
rocks
died
away
in
a
gentle
slope
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
it
was
a
natural
staircase
herbert
and
the
sailor
began
their
ascent
thanks
to
the
vigor
of
their
muscles
they
reached
the
summit
in
a
few
minutes
and
proceeded
to
the
point
above
the
mouth
of
the
river
on
attaining
it
their
first
look
was
cast
upon
the
ocean
which
not
long
before
they
had
traversed
in
such
a
terrible
condition
they
observed
with
emotion
all
that
part
to
the
north
of
the
coast
on
which
the
catastrophe
had
taken
place
it
was
there
that
cyrus
harding
had
disappeared
they
looked
to
see
if
some
portion
of
their
balloon
to
which
a
man
might
possibly
cling
yet
existed
nothing
the
sea
was
but
one
vast
watery
desert
as
to
the
coast
it
was
solitary
also
neither
the
reporter
nor
neb
could
be
anywhere
seen
but
it
was
possible
that
at
this
time
they
were
both
too
far
away
to
be
perceived
something
tells
me
cried
herbert
that
a
man
as
energetic
as
captain
harding
would
not
let
himself
be
drowned
like
other
people
he
must
have
reached
some
point
of
the
shore
dont
you
think
so
pencroft
the
sailor
shook
his
head
sadly
he
little
expected
ever
to
see
cyrus
harding
again
but
wishing
to
leave
some
hope
to
herbert
doubtless
doubtless
said
he
our
engineer
is
a
man
who
would
get
out
of
a
scrape
to
which
any
one
else
would
yield
in
the
meantime
he
examined
the
coast
with
great
attention
stretched
out
below
them
was
the
sandy
shore
bounded
on
the
right
of
the
rivers
mouth
by
lines
of
breakers
the
rocks
which
were
visible
appeared
like
amphibious
monsters
reposing
in
the
surf
beyond
the
reef
the
sea
sparkled
beneath
the
suns
rays
to
the
south
a
sharp
point
closed
the
horizon
and
it
could
not
be
seen
if
the
land
was
prolonged
in
that
direction
or
if
it
ran
southeast
and
southwest
which
would
have
made
this
coast
a
very
long
peninsula
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
bay
the
outline
of
the
shore
was
continued
to
a
great
distance
in
a
wider
curve
there
the
shore
was
low
flat
without
cliffs
and
with
great
banks
of
sand
which
the
tide
left
uncovered
pencroft
and
herbert
then
returned
towards
the
west
their
attention
was
first
arrested
by
the
snowtopped
mountain
which
rose
at
a
distance
of
six
or
seven
miles
from
its
first
declivities
to
within
two
miles
of
the
coast
were
spread
vast
masses
of
wood
relieved
by
large
green
patches
caused
by
the
presence
of
evergreen
trees
then
from
the
edge
of
this
forest
to
the
shore
extended
a
plain
scattered
irregularly
with
groups
of
trees
here
and
there
on
the
left
sparkled
through
glades
the
waters
of
the
little
river
they
could
trace
its
winding
course
back
towards
the
spurs
of
the
mountain
among
which
it
seemed
to
spring
at
the
point
where
the
sailor
had
left
his
raft
of
wood
it
began
to
run
between
the
two
high
granite
walls
but
if
on
the
left
bank
the
wall
remained
clear
and
abrupt
on
the
right
bank
on
the
contrary
it
sank
gradually
the
massive
sides
changed
to
isolated
rocks
the
rocks
to
stones
the
stones
to
shingle
running
to
the
extremity
of
the
point
are
we
on
an
island
murmured
the
sailor
at
any
rate
it
seems
to
be
big
enough
replied
the
lad
an
island
ever
so
big
is
an
island
all
the
same
said
pencroft
but
this
important
question
could
not
yet
be
answered
a
more
perfect
survey
had
to
be
made
to
settle
the
point
as
to
the
land
itself
island
or
continent
it
appeared
fertile
agreeable
in
its
aspect
and
varied
in
its
productions
this
is
satisfactory
observed
pencroft
and
in
our
misfortune
we
must
thank
providence
for
it
god
be
praised
responded
herbert
whose
pious
heart
was
full
of
gratitude
to
the
author
of
all
things
pencroft
and
herbert
examined
for
some
time
the
country
on
which
they
had
been
cast
but
it
was
difficult
to
guess
after
so
hasty
an
inspection
what
the
future
had
in
store
for
them
they
then
returned
following
the
southern
crest
of
the
granite
platform
bordered
by
a
long
fringe
of
jagged
rocks
of
the
most
whimsical
shapes
some
hundreds
of
birds
lived
there
nestled
in
the
holes
of
the
stone
herbert
jumping
over
the
rocks
startled
a
whole
flock
of
these
winged
creatures
oh
cried
he
those
are
not
gulls
nor
seamews
what
are
they
then
asked
pencroft
upon
my
word
one
would
say
they
were
pigeons
just
so
but
these
are
wild
or
rock
pigeons
i
recognize
them
by
the
double
band
of
black
on
the
wing
by
the
white
tail
and
by
their
slatecolored
plumage
but
if
the
rockpigeon
is
good
to
eat
its
eggs
must
be
excellent
and
we
will
soon
see
how
many
they
may
have
left
in
their
nests
we
will
not
give
them
time
to
hatch
unless
it
is
in
the
shape
of
an
omelet
replied
pencroft
merrily
but
what
will
you
make
your
omelet
in
asked
herbert
in
your
hat
well
replied
the
sailor
i
am
not
quite
conjuror
enough
for
that
we
must
come
down
to
eggs
in
the
shell
my
boy
and
i
will
undertake
to
despatch
the
hardest
pencroft
and
herbert
attentively
examined
the
cavities
in
the
granite
and
they
really
found
eggs
in
some
of
the
hollows
a
few
dozen
being
collected
were
packed
in
the
sailors
handkerchief
and
as
the
time
when
the
tide
would
be
full
was
approaching
pencroft
and
herbert
began
to
redescend
towards
the
watercourse
when
they
arrived
there
it
was
an
hour
after
midday
the
tide
had
already
turned
they
must
now
avail
themselves
of
the
ebb
to
take
the
wood
to
the
mouth
pencroft
did
not
intend
to
let
the
raft
go
away
in
the
current
without
guidance
neither
did
he
mean
to
embark
on
it
himself
to
steer
it
but
a
sailor
is
never
at
a
loss
when
there
is
a
question
of
cables
or
ropes
and
pencroft
rapidly
twisted
a
cord
a
few
fathoms
long
made
of
dry
creepers
this
vegetable
cable
was
fastened
to
the
afterpart
of
the
raft
and
the
sailor
held
it
in
his
hand
while
herbert
pushing
off
the
raft
with
a
long
pole
kept
it
in
the
current
this
succeeded
capitally
the
enormous
load
of
wood
drifted
down
the
current
the
bank
was
very
equal
there
was
no
fear
that
the
raft
would
run
aground
and
before
two
oclock
they
arrived
at
the
rivers
mouth
a
few
paces
from
the
chimneys
chapter
5
pencrofts
first
care
after
unloading
the
raft
was
to
render
the
cave
habitable
by
stopping
up
all
the
holes
which
made
it
draughty
sand
stones
twisted
branches
wet
clay
closed
up
the
galleries
open
to
the
south
winds
one
narrow
and
winding
opening
at
the
side
was
kept
to
lead
out
the
smoke
and
to
make
the
fire
draw
the
cave
was
thus
divided
into
three
or
four
rooms
if
such
dark
dens
with
which
a
donkey
would
scarcely
have
been
contented
deserved
the
name
but
they
were
dry
and
there
was
space
to
stand
upright
at
least
in
the
principal
room
which
occupied
the
center
the
floor
was
covered
with
fine
sand
and
taking
all
in
all
they
were
well
pleased
with
it
for
want
of
a
better
perhaps
said
herbert
while
he
and
pencroft
were
working
our
companions
have
found
a
superior
place
to
ours
very
likely
replied
the
seaman
but
as
we
dont
know
we
must
work
all
the
same
better
to
have
two
strings
to
ones
bow
than
no
string
at
all
oh
exclaimed
herbert
how
jolly
it
will
be
if
they
were
to
find
captain
harding
and
were
to
bring
him
back
with
them
yes
indeed
said
pencroft
that
was
a
man
of
the
right
sort
was
exclaimed
herbert
do
you
despair
of
ever
seeing
him
again
god
forbid
replied
the
sailor
their
work
was
soon
done
and
pencroft
declared
himself
very
well
satisfied
now
said
he
our
friends
can
come
back
when
they
like
they
will
find
a
good
enough
shelter
they
now
had
only
to
make
a
fireplace
and
to
prepare
the
supperan
easy
task
large
flat
stones
were
placed
on
the
ground
at
the
opening
of
the
narrow
passage
which
had
been
kept
this
if
the
smoke
did
not
take
the
heat
out
with
it
would
be
enough
to
maintain
an
equal
temperature
inside
their
wood
was
stowed
away
in
one
of
the
rooms
and
the
sailor
laid
in
the
fireplace
some
logs
and
brushwood
the
seaman
was
busy
with
this
when
herbert
asked
him
if
he
had
any
matches
certainly
replied
pencroft
and
i
may
say
happily
for
without
matches
or
tinder
we
should
be
in
a
fix
still
we
might
get
fire
as
the
savages
do
replied
herbert
by
rubbing
two
bits
of
dry
stick
one
against
the
other
all
right
try
my
boy
and
lets
see
if
you
can
do
anything
besides
exercising
your
arms
well
its
a
very
simple
proceeding
and
much
used
in
the
islands
of
the
pacific
i
dont
deny
it
replied
pencroft
but
the
savages
must
know
how
to
do
it
or
employ
a
peculiar
wood
for
more
than
once
i
have
tried
to
get
fire
in
that
way
but
i
could
never
manage
it
i
must
say
i
prefer
matches
by
the
bye
where
are
my
matches
pencroft
searched
in
his
waistcoat
for
the
box
which
was
always
there
for
he
was
a
confirmed
smoker
he
could
not
find
it
he
rummaged
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
but
to
his
horror
he
could
nowhere
discover
the
box
heres
a
go
said
he
looking
at
herbert
the
box
must
have
fallen
out
of
my
pocket
and
got
lost
surely
herbert
you
must
have
somethinga
tinderboxanything
that
can
possibly
make
fire
no
i
havent
pencroft
the
sailor
rushed
out
followed
by
the
boy
on
the
sand
among
the
rocks
near
the
rivers
bank
they
both
searched
carefully
but
in
vain
the
box
was
of
copper
and
therefore
would
have
been
easily
seen
pencroft
asked
herbert
didnt
you
throw
it
out
of
the
car
i
knew
better
than
that
replied
the
sailor
but
such
a
small
article
could
easily
disappear
in
the
tumbling
about
we
have
gone
through
i
would
rather
even
have
lost
my
pipe
confound
the
box
where
can
it
be
look
here
the
tide
is
going
down
said
herbert
lets
run
to
the
place
where
we
landed
it
was
scarcely
probable
that
they
would
find
the
box
which
the
waves
had
rolled
about
among
the
pebbles
at
high
tide
but
it
was
as
well
to
try
herbert
and
pencroft
walked
rapidly
to
the
point
where
they
had
landed
the
day
before
about
two
hundred
feet
from
the
cave
they
hunted
there
among
the
shingle
in
the
clefts
of
the
rocks
but
found
nothing
if
the
box
had
fallen
at
this
place
it
must
have
been
swept
away
by
the
waves
as
the
sea
went
down
they
searched
every
little
crevice
with
no
result
it
was
a
grave
loss
in
their
circumstances
and
for
the
time
irreparable
pencroft
could
not
hide
his
vexation
he
looked
very
anxious
but
said
not
a
word
herbert
tried
to
console
him
by
observing
that
if
they
had
found
the
matches
they
would
very
likely
have
been
wetted
by
the
sea
and
useless
no
my
boy
replied
the
sailor
they
were
in
a
copper
box
which
shut
very
tightly
and
now
what
are
we
to
do
we
shall
certainly
find
some
way
of
making
a
fire
said
herbert
captain
harding
or
mr
spilett
will
not
be
without
them
yes
replied
pencroft
but
in
the
meantime
we
are
without
fire
and
our
companions
will
find
but
a
sorry
repast
on
their
return
but
said
herbert
quickly
do
you
think
it
possible
that
they
have
no
tinder
or
matches
i
doubt
it
replied
the
sailor
shaking
his
head
for
neither
neb
nor
captain
harding
smoke
and
i
believe
that
mr
spilett
would
rather
keep
his
notebook
than
his
matchbox
herbert
did
not
reply
the
loss
of
the
box
was
certainly
to
be
regretted
but
the
boy

still

of
procuring
fire
in
some
way

other
pencroft
more
experienced
did
not
think
so
although
he
was
not
a
man
to
trouble
himself
about
a
small
or
great
grievance
at
any
rate
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
doneto
await
the
return
of
neb
and
the
reporter
but
they
must
give
up
the
feast
of
hard
eggs
which
they
had
meant
to
prepare
and
a
meal
of
raw
flesh
was
not
an
agreeable
prospect
either
for
themselves
or
for
the
others
before
returning
to
the
cave
the
sailor
and
herbert
in
the
event
of
fire
being
positively
unattainable
collected
some
more
shellfish
and
then
silently
retraced
their
steps
to
their
dwelling
pencroft
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
still
looked
for
his
box
he
even
climbed
up
the
left
bank
of
the
river
from
its
mouth
to
the
angle
where
the
raft
had
been
moored
he
returned
to
the
plateau
went
over
it
in
every
direction
searched
among
the
high
grass
on
the
border
of
the
forest
all
in
vain
it
was
five
in
the
evening
when
he
and
herbert
reentered
the
cave
it
is
useless
to
say
that
the
darkest
corners
of
the
passages
were
ransacked
before
they
were
obliged
to
give
it
up
in
despair
towards
six
oclock
when
the
sun
was
disappearing
behind
the
high
lands
of
the
west
herbert
who
was
walking
up
and
down
on
the
strand
signalized
the

they
were
returning
alone
the

heart
sank
the
sailor
had
not
been
deceived
in
his
forebodings
the
engineer
cyrus
harding
had
not
been
found
the
reporter
on
his
arrival
sat
down
on
a
rock
without
saying
anything
exhausted
with
fatigue
dying
of
hunger
he
had
not
strength
to
utter
a
word
as
to
neb
his
red
eyes
showed
how
he
had
cried
and
the
tears
which
he
could
not
restrain
told
too
clearly
that
he
had
lost
all
hope
the
reporter
recounted
all
that
they
had
done
in
their
attempt
to
recover
cyrus
harding
he
and
neb
had
surveyed
the
coast
for
a
distance
of
eight
miles
and
consequently
much
beyond
the
place
where
the
balloon
had
fallen
the
last
time
but
one
a
fall
which
was
followed
by
the
disappearance
of
the
engineer
and
the
dog
top
the
shore
was
solitary
not
a
vestige
of
a
mark
not
even
a
pebble
recently
displaced
not
a
trace
on
the
sand
not
a
human
footstep
on
all
that
part
of
the
beach
it
was
clear
that
that
portion
of
the
shore
had
never
been
visited
by
a
human
being
the
sea
was
as
deserted
as
the
land
and
it
was
there
a
few
hundred
feet
from
the
coast
that
the
engineer
must
have
found
a
tomb
as
spilett
ended
his
account
neb
jumped
up
exclaiming
in
a
voice
which
showed
how
hope
struggled
within
him
no
he
is
not
dead
he
cant
be
dead
it
might
happen
to
any
one
else
but
never
to
him
he
could
get
out
of
anything
then
his
strength
forsaking
him
oh
i
can
do
no
more
he
murmured
neb
said
herbert
running
to
him
we
will
find
him
god
will
give
him
back
to
us
but
in
the
meantime
you
are
hungry
and
you
must
eat
something
so
saying
he
offered
the
poor
negro
a
few
handfuls
of
shellfish
which
was
indeed
wretched
and
insufficient
food
neb
had
not
eaten
anything
for
several
hours
but
he
refused
them
he
could
not
would
not
live
without
his
master
as
to
gideon
spilett
he
devoured
the
shellfish
then
he
laid
himself
down
on
the
sand
at
the
foot
of
a
rock
he
was
very
weak
but
calm
herbert
went
up
to
him
and
taking
his
hand
sir
said
he
we
have
found
a
shelter
which
will
be
better
than
lying
here
night
is
advancing
come
and
rest
tomorrow
we
will
search
farther
the
reporter
got
up
and
guided
by
the
boy
went
towards
the
cave
on
the
way
pencroft
asked
him
in
the
most
natural
tone
if
by
chance
he
happened
to
have
a
match
or
two
the
reporter
stopped
felt
in
his
pockets
but
finding
nothing
said
i
had
some
but
i
must
have
thrown
them
away
the
seaman
then
put
the
same
question
to
neb
and
received
the
same
answer
confound
it
exclaimed
the
sailor
the
reporter
heard
him
and
seizing
his
arm
have
you
no
matches
he
asked
not
one
and
no
fire
in
consequence
ah
cried
neb
if
my
master
was
here
he
would
know
what
to
do
the
four
castaways
remained
motionless
looking
uneasily
at
each
other
herbert
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
by
saying
mr
spilett
you
are
a
smoker
and
always
have
matches
about
you
perhaps
you
havent
looked
well
try
again
a
single
match
will
be
enough
the
reporter
hunted
again
in
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
waistcoat
and
greatcoat
and
at
last
to
pencrofts
great
joy
no
less
to
his
extreme
surprise
he
felt
a
tiny
piece
of
wood
entangled
in
the
lining
of
his
waistcoat
he
seized
it
with
his
fingers
through
the
stuff
but
he
could
not
get
it
out
if
this
was
a
match
and
a
single
one
it
was
of
great
importance
not
to
rub
off
the
phosphorus
will
you
let
me
try
said
the
boy
and
very
cleverly
without
breaking
it
he
managed
to
draw
out
the
wretched
yet
precious
little
bit
of
wood
which
was
of
such
great
importance
to
these
poor
men
it
was
unused
hurrah
cried
pencroft
it
is
as
good
as
having
a
whole
cargo
he
took
the
match
and
followed
by
his
companions
entered
the
cave
this
small
piece
of
wood
of
which
so
many
in
an
inhabited
country
are
wasted
with
indifference
and
are
of
no
value
must
here
be
used
with
the
greatest
caution
the
sailor
first
made
sure
that
it
was
quite
dry
that
done
we
must
have
some
paper
said
he
here
replied
spilett
after
some
hesitation
tearing
a
leaf
out
of
his
notebook
pencroft
took
the
piece
of
paper
which
the
reporter
held
out
to
him
and
knelt
down
before
the
fireplace
some
handfuls
of
grass
leaves
and
dry
moss
were
placed
under
the
fagots
and
disposed
in
such
a
way
that
the
air
could
easily
circulate
and
the
dry
wood
would
rapidly
catch
fire
pencroft
then
twisted
the
piece
of
paper
into
the
shape
of
a
cone
as
smokers
do
in
a
high
wind
and
poked
it
in
among
the
moss
taking
a
small
rough
stone
he
wiped
it
carefully
and
with
a
beating
heart
holding
his
breath
he
gently
rubbed
the
match
the
first
attempt
did
not
produce
any
effect
pencroft
had
not
struck
hard
enough
fearing
to
rub
off
the
phosphorus
no
i
cant
do
it
said
he
my
hand
trembles
the
match
has
missed
fire
i
cannot
i
will
not
and
rising
he
told
herbert
to
take
his
place
certainly
the
boy
had
never
in
all
his
life
been
so
nervous
prometheus
going
to
steal
the
fire
from
heaven
could
not
have
been
more
anxious
he
did
not
hesitate
however
but
struck
the
match
directly
a
little
spluttering
was
heard
and
a
tiny
blue
flame
sprang
up
making
a
choking
smoke
herbert
quickly
turned
the
match
so
as
to
augment
the
flame
and
then
slipped
it
into
the
paper
cone
which
in
a
few
seconds
too
caught
fire
and
then
the
moss
a
minute
later
the
dry
wood
crackled
and
a
cheerful
flame
assisted
by
the
vigorous
blowing
of
the
sailor
sprang
up
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
at
last
cried
pencroft
getting
up
i
was
never
so
nervous
before
in
all
my
life
the
flat
stones
made
a
capital
fireplace
the
smoke
went
quite
easily
out
at
the
narrow
passage
the
chimney
drew
and
an
agreeable
warmth
was
not
long
in
being
felt
they
must
now
take
great
care
not
to
let
the
fire
go
out
and
always
to
keep
some
embers
alight
it
only
needed
care
and
attention
as
they
had
plenty
of
wood
and
could
renew
their
store
at
any
time
pencrofts
first
thought
was
to
use
the
fire
by
preparing
a
more
nourishing
supper
than
a
dish
of
shellfish
two
dozen
eggs
were
brought
by
herbert
the
reporter
leaning
up
in
a
corner
watched
these
preparations
without
saying
anything
a
threefold
thought
weighed
on
his
mind
was
cyrus
still
alive
if
he
was
alive
where
was
he
if
he
had
survived
from
his
fall
how
was
it
that
he
had
not
found
some
means
of
making
known
his
existence
as
to
neb
he
was
roaming
about
the
shore
he
was
like
a
body
without
a
soul
pencroft
knew
fifty
ways
of
cooking
eggs
but
this
time
he
had
no
choice
and
was
obliged
to
content
himself
with
roasting
them
under
the
hot
cinders
in
a
few
minutes
the
cooking
was
done
and
the
seaman
invited
the
reporter
to
take
his
share
of
the
supper
such
was
the
first
repast
of
the
castaways
on
this
unknown
coast
the
hard
eggs
were
excellent
and
as
eggs
contain
everything
indispensable
to
mans
nourishment
these
poor
people
thought
themselves
well
off
and
were
much
strengthened
by
them
oh
if
only
one
of
them
had
not
been
missing
at
this
meal
if
the
five
prisoners
who
escaped
from
richmond
had
been
all
there
under
the
piledup
rocks
before
this
clear
crackling
fire
on
the
dry
sand
what
thanksgiving
must
they
have
rendered
to
heaven
but
the
most
ingenious
the
most
learned
he
who
was
their
unquestioned
chief
cyrus
harding
was
alas
missing
and
his
body
had
not
even
obtained
a
burialplace
thus
passed
the
25th
of
march
night
had
come
on
outside
could
be
heard
the
howling
of
the
wind
and
the
monotonous
sound
of
the
surf
breaking
on
the
shore
the
waves
rolled
the
shingle
backwards
and
forwards
with
a
deafening
noise
the
reporter
retired
into
a
dark
corner
after
having
shortly
noted
down
the
occurrences
of
the
day
the
first
appearance
of
this
new
land
the
loss
of
their
leader
the
exploration
of
the
coast
the
incident
of
the
matches
etc
and
then
overcome
by
fatigue
he
managed
to
forget
his
sorrows
in
sleep
herbert
went
to
sleep
directly
as
to
the
sailor
he
passed
the
night
with
one
eye
on
the
fire
on
which
he
did
not
spare
fuel
but
one
of
the
castaways
did
not
sleep
in
the
cave
the
inconsolable
despairing
neb
notwithstanding
all
that
his
companions
could
say
to
induce
him
to
take
some
rest

all
night
long
on
the
shore

the
inventory
of
the
articles
possessed
by
these
castaways
from
the
clouds
thrown
upon
a
coast
which
appeared
to
be
uninhabited
was
soon
made
out
they
had
nothing
save
the
clothes
which
they
were
wearing
at
the
time
of
the
catastrophe
we
must
mention
however
a
notebook
and
a
watch
which
gideon
spilett
had
kept
doubtless
by
inadvertence
not
a
weapon
not
a
tool
not
even
a
pocketknife
for
while
in
the
car
they
had
thrown
out
everything
to
lighten
the
balloon
the
imaginary
heroes
of
daniel
defoe
or
of
wyss
as
well
as
selkirk
and
raynal
shipwrecked
on
juan
fernandez
and
on
the
archipelago
of
the
aucklands
were
never
in
such
absolute
destitution
either
they
had
abundant
resources
from
their
stranded
vessels
in
grain
cattle
tools
ammunition
or
else
some
things
were
thrown
up
on
the
coast
which
supplied
them
with
all
the
first
necessities
of
life
but
here
not
any
instrument
whatever
not
a
utensil
from
nothing
they
must
supply
themselves
with
everything
and
yet
if
cyrus
harding
had
been
with
them
if
the
engineer
could
have
brought
his
practical
science
his
inventive
mind
to
bear
on
their
situation
perhaps
all
hope
would
not
have
been
lost
alas
they
must
hope
no
longer
again
to
see
cyrus
harding
the
castaways
could
expect
nothing
but
from
themselves
and
from
that
providence
which
never
abandons
those
whose
faith
is
sincere
but
ought
they
to
establish
themselves
on
this
part
of
the
coast
without
trying
to
know
to
what
continent
it
belonged
if
it
was
inhabited
or
if
they
were
on
the
shore
of
a
desert
island
it
was
an
important
question
and
should
be
solved
with
the
shortest
possible
delay
from
its
answer
they
would
know
what
measures
to
take
however
according
to
pencrofts
advice
it
appeared
best
to
wait
a
few
days
before
commencing
an
exploration
they
must
in
fact
prepare
some
provisions
and
procure
more
strengthening
food
than
eggs
and
molluscs
the
explorers
before
undertaking
new
fatigues
must
first
of
all
recruit
their
strength
the
chimneys
offered
a
retreat
sufficient
for
the
present
the
fire
was
lighted
and
it
was
easy
to
preserve
some
embers
there
were
plenty
of
shellfish
and
eggs
among
the
rocks
and
on
the
beach
it
would
be
easy
to
kill
a
few
of
the
pigeons
which
were
flying
by
hundreds
about
the
summit
of
the
plateau
either
with
sticks
or
stones
perhaps
the
trees
of
the
neighboring
forest
would
supply
them
with
eatable
fruit
lastly
the
sweet
water
was
there
it
was
accordingly
settled
that
for
a
few
days
they
would
remain
at
the
chimneys
so
as
to
prepare
themselves
for
an
expedition
either
along
the
shore
or
into
the
interior
of
the
country
this
plan
suited
neb
particularly
as
obstinate
in
his
ideas
as
in
his
presentiments
he
was
in
no
haste
to
abandon
this
part
of
the
coast
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
he
did
not
he
would
not
believe
in
the
loss
of
cyrus
harding
no
it
did
not
seem
to
him
possible
that
such
a
man
had
ended
in
this
vulgar
fashion
carried
away
by
a
wave
drowned
in
the
floods
a
few
hundred
feet
from
a
shore
as
long
as
the
waves
had
not
cast
up
the
body
of
the
engineer
as
long
as
he
neb
had
not
seen
with
his
eyes
touched
with
his
hands
the
corpse
of
his
master
he
would
not
believe
in
his
death
and
this
idea
rooted
itself
deeper
than
ever
in
his
determined
heart
an
illusion
perhaps
but
still
an
illusion
to
be
respected
and
one
which
the
sailor
did
not
wish
to
destroy
as
for
him
he
hoped
no
longer
but
there
was
no
use
in
arguing
with
neb
he
was
like
the
dog
who
will
not
leave
the
place
where
his
master
is
buried
and
his
grief
was
such
that
most
probably
he
would
not
survive
him
this
same
morning
the
26th
of
march
at
daybreak
neb
had
set
out
on
the
shore
in
a
northerly
direction
and
he
had
returned
to
the
spot
where
the
sea
no
doubt
had
closed
over
the
unfortunate
harding
that
days
breakfast
was
composed
solely
of
pigeons
eggs
and
lithodomes
herbert
had
found
some
salt
deposited
by
evaporation
in
the
hollows
of
the
rocks
and
this
mineral
was
very
welcome
the
repast
ended
pencroft
asked
the
reporter
if
he
wished
to
accompany
herbert
and
himself
to
the
forest
where
they
were
going
to
try
to
hunt
but
on
consideration
it
was
thought
necessary
that
someone
should
remain
to
keep
in
the
fire
and
to
be
at
hand
in
the
highly
improbable
event
of
neb
requiring
aid
the
reporter
accordingly
remained
behind
to
the
chase
herbert
said
the
sailor
we
shall
find
ammunition
on
our
way
and
cut
our
weapons
in
the
forest
but
at
the
moment
of
starting
herbert
observed
that
since
they
had
no
tinder
it
would
perhaps
be
prudent
to
replace
it
by
another
substance
what
asked
pencroft
burnt
linen
replied
the
boy
that
could
in
case
of
need
serve
for
tinder
the
sailor
thought
it
very
sensible
advice
only
it
had
the
inconvenience
of
necessitating
the
sacrifice
of
a
piece
of
handkerchief
notwithstanding
the
thing
was
well
worth
while
trying
and
a
part
of
pencrofts
large
checked
handkerchief
was
soon
reduced
to
the
state
of
a
halfburnt
rag
this
inflammable
material
was
placed
in
the
central
chamber
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
cavity
in
the
rock
sheltered
from
all
wind
and
damp
it
was
nine
oclock
in
the
morning
the
weather
was
threatening
and
the
breeze
blew
from
the
southeast
herbert
and
pencroft
turned
the
angle
of
the
chimneys
not
without
having
cast
a
look
at
the
smoke
which
just
at
that
place
curled
round
a
point
of
rock
they
ascended
the
left
bank
of
the
river
arrived
at
the
forest
pencroft
broke
from
the
first
tree
two
stout
branches
which
he
transformed
into
clubs
the
ends
of
which
herbert
rubbed
smooth
on
a
rock
oh
what
would
they
not
have
given
for
a
knife
the
two
hunters
now
advanced
among
the
long
grass
following
the
bank
from
the
turning
which
directed
its
course
to
the
southwest
the
river
narrowed
gradually
and
the
channel
lay
between
high
banks
over
which
the
trees
formed
a
double
arch
pencroft
lest
they
should
lose
themselves
resolved
to
follow
the
course
of
the
stream
which
would
always
lead
them
back
to
the
point
from
which
they
started
but
the
bank
was
not
without
some
obstacles
here
the
flexible
branches
of
the
trees
bent
level
with
the
current
there
creepers
and
thorns
which
they
had
to
break
down
with
their
sticks
herbert
often
glided
among
the
broken
stumps
with
the
agility
of
a
young
cat
and
disappeared
in
the
underwood
but
pencroft
called
him
back
directly
begging
him
not
to
wander
away
meanwhile
the
sailor
attentively
observed
the
disposition
and
nature
of
the
surrounding
country
on
the
left
bank
the
ground
which
was
flat
and
marshy
rose
imperceptibly
towards
the
interior
it
looked
there
like
a
network
of
liquid
threads
which
doubtless
reached
the
river
by
some
underground
drain
sometimes
a
stream
ran
through
the
underwood
which
they
crossed
without
difficulty
the
opposite
shore
appeared
to
be
more
uneven
and
the
valley
of
which
the
river
occupied
the
bottom
was
more
clearly
visible
the
hill
covered
with
trees
disposed
in
terraces
intercepted
the
view
on
the
right
bank
walking
would
have
been
difficult
for
the
declivities
fell
suddenly
and
the
trees
bending
over
the
water
were
only
sustained
by
the
strength
of
their
roots
it
is
needless
to
add
that
this
forest
as
well
as
the
coast
already
surveyed
was
destitute
of
any
sign
of
human
life
pencroft
only
saw
traces
of
quadrupeds
fresh
footprints
of
animals
of
which
he
could
not
recognize
the
species
in
all
probability
and
such
was
also
herberts
opinion
some
had
been
left
by
formidable
wild
beasts
which
doubtless
would
give
them
some
trouble
but
nowhere
did
they
observe
the
mark
of
an
axe
on
the
trees
nor
the
ashes
of
a
fire
nor
the
impression
of
a
human
foot
on
this
they
might
probably
congratulate
themselves
for
on
any
land
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
the
presence
of
man
was
perhaps
more
to
be
feared
than
desired
herbert
and
pencroft
speaking
little
for
the
difficulties
of
the
way
were
great
advanced
very
slowly
and
after
walking
for
an
hour
they
had
scarcely
gone
more
than
a
mile
as
yet
the
hunt
had
not
been
successful
however
some
birds
sang
and
fluttered
in
the
foliage
and
appeared
very
timid
as
if
man
had
inspired
them
with
an
instinctive
fear
among
others
herbert
described
in
a
marshy
part
of
the
forest
a
bird
with
a
long
pointed
beak
closely
resembling
the
kingfisher
but
its
plumage
was
not
fine
though
of
a
metallic
brilliancy
that
must
be
a
jacamar
said
herbert
trying
to
get
nearer
this
will
be
a
good
opportunity
to
taste
jacamar
replied
the
sailor
if
that
fellow
is
in
a
humor
to
be
roasted
just
then
a
stone
cleverly
thrown
by
the
boy
struck
the
creature
on
the
wing
but
the
blow
did
not
disable
it
and
the
jacamar
ran
off
and
disappeared
in
an
instant
how
clumsy
i
am
cried
herbert
no
no
my
boy
replied
the
sailor
the
blow
was
well
aimed
many
a
one
would
have
missed
it
altogether
come
dont
be
vexed
with
yourself
we
shall
catch
it
another
day
as
the
hunters
advanced
the
trees
were
found
to
be
more
scattered
many
being
magnificent
but
none
bore
eatable
fruit
pencroft
searched
in
vain
for
some
of
those
precious
palmtrees
which
are
employed
in
so
many
ways
in
domestic
life
and
which
have
been
found
as
far
as
the
fortieth
parallel
in
the
northern
hemisphere
and
to
the
thirtyfifth
only
in
the
southern
hemisphere
but
this
forest
was
only
composed
of
coniferae
such
as
deodaras
already
recognized
by
herbert
and
douglas
pine
similar
to
those
which
grow
on
the
northwest
coast
of
america
and
splendid
firs
measuring
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
height
at
this
moment
a
flock
of
birds
of
a
small
size
and
pretty
plumage
with
long
glancing
tails
dispersed
themselves
among
the
branches
strewing
their
feathers
which
covered
the
ground
as
with
fine
down
herbert
picked
up
a
few
of
these
feathers
and
after
having
examined
them
these
are
couroucous
said
he
i
should
prefer
a
moorcock
or
guineafowl
replied
pencroft
still
if
they
are
good
to
eat
they
are
good
to
eat
and
also
their
flesh
is
very
delicate
replied
herbert
besides
if
i
dont
mistake
it
is
easy
to
approach
and
kill
them
with
a
stick
the
sailor
and
the
lad
creeping
among
the
grass
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
whose
lower
branches
were
covered
with
little
birds
the
couroucous
were
waiting
the
passage
of
insects
which
served
for
their
nourishment
their
feathery
feet
could
be
seen
clasping
the
slender
twigs
which
supported
them
the
hunters
then
rose
and
using
their
sticks
like
scythes
they
mowed
down
whole
rows
of
these
couroucous
who
never
thought
of
flying
away
and
stupidly
allowed
themselves
to
be
knocked
off
a
hundred
were
already
heaped
on
the
ground
before
the
others
made
up
their
minds
to
fly
well
said
pencroft
here
is
game
which
is
quite
within
the
reach
of
hunters
like
us
we
have
only
to
put
out
our
hands
and
take
it
the
sailor
having
strung
the
couroucous
like
larks
on
flexible
twigs
they
then
continued
their
exploration
the
stream
here
made
a
bend
towards
the
south
but
this
detour
was
probably
not
prolonged
for
the
river
must
have
its
source
in
the
mountain
and
be
supplied
by
the
melting
of
the
snow
which
covered
the
sides
of
the
central
cone
the
particular
object
of
their
expedition
was
as
has
been
said
to
procure
the
greatest
possible
quantity
of
game
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
chimneys
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
as
yet
this
object
had
not
been
attained
so
the
sailor
actively
pursued
his
researches
though
he
exclaimed
when
some
animal
which
he
had
not
even
time
to
recognize
fled
into
the
long
grass
if
only
we
had
had
the
dog
top
but
top
had
disappeared
at
the
same
time
as
his
master
and
had
probably
perished
with
him
towards
three
oclock
new
flocks
of
birds
were
seen
through
certain
trees
at
whose
aromatic
berries
they
were
pecking
those
of
the
junipertree
among
others
suddenly
a
loud
trumpet
call
resounded
through
the
forest
this
strange
and
sonorous
cry
was
produced
by
a
game
bird
called
grouse
in
the
united
states
they
soon
saw
several
couples
whose
plumage
was
rich
chestnutbrown
mottled
with
dark
brown
and
tail
of
the
same
color
herbert
recognized
the
males
by
the
two
winglike
appendages
raised
on
the
neck
pencroft
determined
to
get
hold
of
at
least
one
of
these
gallinaceae
which
were
as
large
as
a
fowl
and
whose
flesh
is
better
than
that
of
a
pullet
but
it
was
difficult
for
they
would
not
allow
themselves
to
be
approached
after
several
fruitless
attempts
which
resulted
in
nothing
but
scaring
the
grouse
the
sailor
said
to
the
lad
decidedly
since
we
cant
kill
them
on
the
wing
we
must
try
to
take
them
with
a
line
like
a
fish
cried
herbert
much
surprised
at
the
proposal
like
a
fish
replied
the
sailor
quite
seriously
pencroft
had
found
among
the
grass
half
a
dozen
grouse
nests
each
having
three
or
four
eggs
he
took
great
care
not
to
touch
these
nests
to
which
their
proprietors
would
not
fail
to
return
it
was
around
these
that
he
meant
to
stretch
his
lines
not
snares
but
real
fishinglines
he
took
herbert
to
some
distance
from
the
nests
and
there
prepared
his
singular
apparatus
with
all
the
care
which
a
disciple
of
izaak
walton
would
have
used
herbert
watched
the
work
with
great
interest
though
rather
doubting
its
success
the
lines
were
made
of
fine
creepers
fastened
one
to
the
other
of
the
length
of
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
thick
strong
thorns
the
points
bent
back
which
were
supplied
from
a
dwarf
acacia
bush
were
fastened
to
the
ends
of
the
creepers
by
way
of
hooks
large
red
worms
which
were
crawling
on
the
ground
furnished
bait
this
done
pencroft
passing
among
the
grass
and
concealing
himself
skillfully
placed
the
end
of
his
lines
armed
with
hooks
near
the
grouse
nests
then
he
returned
took
the
other
ends
and
hid
with
herbert
behind
a
large
tree
there
they
both
waited
patiently
though
it
must
be
said
that
herbert
did
not
reckon
much
on
the
success
of
the
inventive
pencroft
a
whole
halfhour
passed
but
then
as
the
sailor
had
surmised
several
couple
of
grouse
returned
to
their
nests
they
walked
along
pecking
the
ground
and
not
suspecting
in
any
way
the
presence
of
the
hunters
who
besides
had
taken
care
to
place
themselves
to
leeward
of
the
gallinaceae
the
lad
felt
at
this
moment
highly
interested
he
held
his
breath
and
pencroft
his
eyes
staring
his
mouth
open
his
lips
advanced
as
if
about
to
taste
a
piece
of
grouse
scarcely
breathed
meanwhile
the
birds
walked
about
the
hooks
without
taking
any
notice
of
them
pencroft
then
gave
little
tugs
which
moved
the
bait
as
if
the
worms
had
been
still
alive
the
sailor
undoubtedly
felt
much
greater
anxiety
than
does
the
fisherman
for
he
does
not
see
his
prey
coming
through
the
water
the
jerks
attracted
the
attention
of
the
gallinaceae
and
they
attacked
the
hooks
with
their
beaks
three
voracious
grouse
swallowed
at
the
same
moment
bait
and
hook
suddenly
with
a
smart
jerk
pencroft
struck
his
line
and
a
flapping
of
wings
showed
that
the
birds
were
taken
hurrah
he
cried
rushing
towards
the
game
of
which
he
made
himself
master
in
an
instant
herbert
clapped
his
hands
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
seen
birds
taken
with
a
line
but
the
sailor
modestly
confessed
that
it
was
not
his
first
attempt
and
that
besides
he
could
not
claim
the
merit
of
invention
and
at
any
rate
added
he
situated
as
we
are
we
must
hope
to
hit
upon
many
other
contrivances
the
grouse
were
fastened
by
their
claws
and
pencroft
delighted
at
not
having
to
appear
before
their
companions
with
empty
hands
and
observing
that
the
day
had
begun
to
decline
judged
it
best
to
return
to
their
dwelling
the
direction
was
indicated
by
the
river
whose
course
they
had
only
to
follow
and
towards
six
oclock
tired
enough
with
their
excursion
herbert
and
pencroft
arrived
at
the
chimneys
chapter
7
gideon
spilett
was
standing
motionless
on
the
shore
his
arms
crossed
gazing
over
the
sea
the
horizon
of
which
was
lost
towards
the
east
in
a
thick
black
cloud
which
was
spreading
rapidly
towards
the
zenith
the
wind
was
already
strong
and
increased
with
the
decline
of
day
the
whole
sky
was
of
a
threatening
aspect
and
the
first
symptoms
of
a
violent
storm
were
clearly
visible
herbert
entered
the
chimneys
and
pencroft
went
towards
the
reporter
the
latter
deeply
absorbed
did
not
see
him
approach
we
are
going
to
have
a
dirty
night
mr
spilett
said
the
sailor
petrels
delight
in
wind
and
rain
the
reporter
turning
at
the
moment
saw
pencroft
and
his
first
words
were
at
what
distance
from
the
coast
would
you
say
the
car
was
when
the
waves
carried
off
our
companion
the
sailor
had
not
expected
this
question
he
reflected
an
instant
and
replied
two
cables
lengths
at
the
most
but
what
is
a
cables
length
asked
gideon
spilett
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
fathoms
or
six
hundred
feet
then
said
the
reporter
cyrus
harding
must
have
disappeared
twelve
hundred
feet
at
the
most
from
the
shore
about
that
replied
pencroft
and
his
dog
also
also
what
astonishes
me
rejoined
the
reporter
while
admitting
that
our
companion
has
perished
is
that
top
has
also
met
his
death
and
that
neither
the
body
of
the
dog
nor
of
his
master
has
been
cast
on
the
shore
it
is
not
astonishing
with
such
a
heavy
sea
replied
the
sailor
besides
it
is
possible
that
currents
have
carried
them
farther
down
the
coast
then
it
is
your
opinion
that
our
friend
has
perished
in
the
waves
again
asked
the
reporter
that
is
my
opinion
my
own
opinion
said
gideon
spilett
with
due
deference
to
your
experience
pencroft
is
that
in
the
double
fact
of
the
absolute
disappearance
of
cyrus
and
top
living
or
dead
there
is
something
unaccountable
and
unlikely
i
wish
i
could
think
like
you
mr
spilett
replied
pencroft
unhappily
my
mind
is
made
up
on
this
point
having
said
this
the
sailor
returned
to
the
chimneys
a
good
fire
crackled
on
the
hearth
herbert
had
just
thrown
on
an
armful
of
dry
wood
and
the
flame
cast
a
bright
light
into
the
darkest
parts
of
the
passage
pencroft
immediately
began
to
prepare
the
dinner
it
appeared
best
to
introduce
something
solid
into
the
bill
of
fare
for
all
needed
to
get
up
their
strength
the
strings
of
couroucous
were
kept
for
the
next
day
but
they
plucked
a
couple
of
grouse
which
were
soon
spitted
on
a
stick
and
roasting
before
a
blazing
fire
at
seven
in
the
evening
neb
had
not
returned
the
prolonged
absence
of
the
negro
made
pencroft
very
uneasy
it
was
to
be
feared
that
he
had
met
with
an
accident
on
this
unknown
land
or
that
the
unhappy
fellow
had
been
driven
to
some
act
of
despair
but
herbert
drew
very
different
conclusions
from
this
absence
according
to
him
nebs
delay
was
caused
by
some
new
circumstances
which
had
induced
him
to
prolong
his
search
also
everything
new
must
be
to
the
advantage
of
cyrus
harding
why
had
neb
not
returned
unless
hope
still
detained
him
perhaps
he
had
found
some
mark
a
footstep
a
trace
which
had
put
him
in
the
right
path
perhaps
he
was
at
this
moment
on
a
certain
track
perhaps
even
he
was
near
his
master
thus
the
lad
reasoned
thus
he
spoke
his
companions
let
him
talk
the
reporter
alone
approved
with
a
gesture
but
what
pencroft
thought
most
probable
was
that
neb
had
pushed
his
researches
on
the
shore
farther
than
the
day
before
and
that
he
had
not
as
yet
had
time
to
return
herbert
however
agitated
by
vague
presentiments
several
times
manifested
an
intention
to
go
to
meet
neb
but
pencroft
assured
him
that
that
would
be
a
useless
course
that
in
the
darkness
and
deplorable
weather
he
could
not
find
any
traces
of
neb
and
that
it
would
be
much
better
to
wait
if
neb
had
not
made
his
appearance
by
the
next
day
pencroft
would
not
hesitate
to
join
him
in
his
search
gideon
spilett
approved
of
the
sailors
opinion
that
it
was
best
not
to
divide
and
herbert
was
obliged
to
give
up
his
project
but
two
large
tears
fell
from
his
eyes
the
reporter
could
not
refrain
from
embracing
the
generous
boy
bad
weather
now
set
in
a
furious
gale
from
the
southeast
passed
over
the
coast
the
sea
roared
as
it
beat
over
the
reef
heavy
rain
was
dashed
by
the
storm
into
particles
like
dust
ragged
masses
of
vapor
drove
along
the
beach
on
which
the
tormented
shingles
sounded
as
if
poured
out
in
cartloads
while
the
sand
raised
by
the
wind
added
as
it
were
mineral
dust
to
that
which
was
liquid
and
rendered
the
united
attack
insupportable
between
the
rivers
mouth
and
the
end
of
the
cliff
eddies
of
wind
whirled
and
gusts
from
this
maelstrom
lashed
the
water
which
ran
through
the
narrow
valley
the
smoke
from
the
fireplace
was
also
driven
back
through
the
opening
filling
the
passages
and
rendering
them
uninhabitable
therefore
as
the
grouse
were
cooked
pencroft
let
the
fire
die
away
and
only
preserved
a
few
embers
buried
under
the
ashes
at
eight
oclock
neb
had
not
appeared
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
frightful
weather
alone
hindered
his
return
and
that
he
must
have
taken
refuge
in
some
cave
to
await
the
end
of
the
storm
or
at
least
the
return
of
day
as
to
going
to
meet
him
or
attempting
to
find
him
it
was
impossible
the
game
constituted
the
only
dish
at
supper
the
meat
was
excellent
and
pencroft
and
herbert
whose
long
excursion
had
rendered
them
very
hungry
devoured
it
with
infinite
satisfaction
their
meal
concluded
each
retired
to
the
corner
in
which
he
had
rested
the
preceding
night
and
herbert
was
not
long
in
going
to
sleep
near
the
sailor
who
had
stretched
himself
beside
the
fireplace
outside
as
the
night
advanced
the
tempest
also
increased
in
strength
until
it
was
equal
to
that
which
had
carried
the
prisoners
from
richmond
to
this
land
in
the
pacific
the
tempests
which
are
frequent
during
the
seasons
of
the
equinox
and
which
are
so
prolific
in
catastrophes
are
above
all
terrible
over
this
immense
ocean
which
opposes
no
obstacle
to
their
fury
no
description
can
give
an
idea
of
the
terrific
violence
of
the
gale
as
it
beat
upon
the
unprotected
coast
happily
the
pile
of
rocks
which
formed
the
chimneys
was
solid
it
was
composed
of
enormous
blocks
of
granite
a
few
of
which
insecurely
balanced
seemed
to
tremble
on
their
foundations
and
pencroft
could
feel
rapid
quiverings
under
his
head
as
it
rested
on
the
rock
but
he
repeated
to
himself
and
rightly
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
and
that
their
retreat
would
not
give
way
however
he
heard
the
noise
of
stones
torn
from
the
summit
of
the
plateau
by
the
wind
falling
down
on
to
the
beach
a
few
even
rolled
on
to
the
upper
part
of
the
chimneys
or
flew
off
in
fragments
when
they
were
projected
perpendicularly
twice
the
sailor
rose
and
intrenched
himself
at
the
opening
of
the
passage
so
as
to
take
a
look
in
safety
at
the
outside
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
from
these
showers
which
were
not
considerable
and
he
returned
to
his
couch
before
the
fireplace
where
the
embers
glowed
beneath
the
ashes
notwithstanding
the
fury
of
the
hurricane
the
uproar
of
the
tempest
the
thunder
and
the
tumult
herbert
slept
profoundly
sleep
at
last
took
possession
of
pencroft
whom
a
seafaring
life
had
habituated
to
anything
gideon
spilett
alone
was
kept
awake
by
anxiety
he
reproached
himself
with
not
having
accompanied
neb
it
was
evident
that
he
had
not
abandoned
all
hope
the
presentiments
which
had
troubled
herbert
did
not
cease
to
agitate
him
also
his
thoughts
were
concentrated
on
neb
why
had
neb
not
returned
he
tossed
about
on
his
sandy
couch
scarcely
giving
a
thought
to
the
struggle
of
the
elements
now
and
then
his
eyes
heavy
with
fatigue
closed
for
an
instant
but
some
sudden
thought
reopened
them
almost
immediately
meanwhile
the
night
advanced
and
it
was
perhaps
two
hours
from
morning
when
pencroft
then
sound
asleep
was
vigorously
shaken
whats
the
matter
he
cried
rousing
himself
and
collecting
his
ideas
with
the
promptitude
usual
to
seamen
the
reporter
was
leaning
over
him
and
saying
listen
pencroft
listen
the
sailor
strained
his
ears
but
could
hear
no
noise
beyond
those
caused
by
the
storm
it
is
the
wind
said
he
no
replied
gideon
spilett
listening
again
i
thought
i
heard
what
the
barking
of
a
dog
a
dog
cried
pencroft
springing
up
yesbarking
its
not
possible
replied
the
sailor
and
besides
how
in
the
roaring
of
the
storm
stoplisten
said
the
reporter
pencroft
listened
more
attentively
and
really
thought
he
heard
during
a
lull
distant
barking
well
said
the
reporter
pressing
the

it

cried
herbert
who
had
just
awoke
and
all
three
rushed
towards
the
opening
of
the
chimneys
they
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
out
the
wind
drove
them
back
but
at
last
they
succeeded
and
could
only
remain
standing
by
leaning
against
the
rocks
they
looked
about
but
could
not
speak
the
darkness
was
intense
the
sea
the
sky
the
land
were
all
mingled
in
one
black
mass
not
a
speck
of
light
was
visible
the
reporter
and
his
companions
remained
thus
for
a
few
minutes
overwhelmed
by
the
wind
drenched
by
the
rain
blinded
by
the
sand
then
in
a
pause
of
the
tumult
they
again
heard
the
barking
which
they
found
must
be
at
some
distance
it
could
only
be
top
but
was
he
alone
or
accompanied
he
was
most
probably
alone
for
if
neb
had
been
with
him
he
would
have
made
his
way
more
directly
towards
the
chimneys
the
sailor
squeezed
the
reporters
hand
for
he
could
not
make
himself
heard
in
a
way
which
signified
wait
then
he
reentered
the
passage
an
instant
after
he
issued
with
a
lighted
fagot
which
he
threw
into
the
darkness
whistling
shrilly
it
appeared
as
if
this
signal
had
been
waited
for
the
barking
immediately
came
nearer
and
soon
a
dog
bounded
into
the
passage
pencroft
herbert
and
spilett
entered
after
him
an
armful
of
dry
wood
was
thrown
on
the
embers
the
passage
was
lighted
up
with
a
bright
flame
it
is
top
cried
herbert
it
was
indeed
top
a
magnificent
anglonorman
who
derived
from
these
two
races
crossed
the
swiftness
of
foot
and
the
acuteness
of
smell
which
are
the
preeminent
qualities
of
coursing
dogs
it
was
the
dog
of
the
engineer
cyrus
harding
but
he
was
alone
neither
neb
nor
his
master
accompanied
him
how
was
it
that
his
instinct
had
guided
him
straight
to
the
chimneys
which
he
did
not
know
it
appeared
inexplicable
above
all
in
the
midst
of
this
black
night
and
in
such
a
tempest
but
what
was
still
more
inexplicable
was
that
top
was
neither
tired
nor
exhausted
nor
even
soiled
with
mud
or
sandherbert
had
drawn
him
towards
him
and
was
patting
his
head
the
dog
rubbing
his
neck
against
the
lads
hands
if
the
dog
is
found
the
master
will
be
found
also
said
the
reporter
god
grant
it
responded
herbert
let
us
set
off
top
will
guide
us
pencroft
did
not
make
any
objection
he
felt
that
tops
arrival
contradicted
his
conjectures
come
along
then
said
he
pencroft
carefully
covered
the
embers
on
the
hearth
he
placed
a
few
pieces
of
wood
among
them
so
as
to
keep
in
the
fire
until
their
return
then
preceded
by
the
dog
who
seemed
to
invite
them
by
short
barks
to
come
with
him
and
followed
by
the
reporter
and
the
boy
he
dashed
out
after
having
put
up
in
his
handkerchief
the
remains
of
the
supper
the
storm
was
then
in
all
its
violence
and
perhaps
at
its
height
not
a
single
ray
of
light
from
the
moon
pierced
through
the
clouds
to
follow
a
straight
course
was
difficult
it
was
best
to
rely
on
tops
instinct
they
did
so
the
reporter
and
herbert
walked
behind
the
dog
and
the
sailor
brought
up
the
rear
it
was
impossible
to
exchange
a
word
the
rain
was
not
very
heavy
but
the
wind
was
terrific
however
one
circumstance
favored
the
seaman
and
his
two
companions
the
wind
being
southeast
consequently
blew
on
their
backs
the
clouds
of
sand
which
otherwise
would
have
been
insupportable
from
being
received
behind
did
not
in
consequence
impede
their
progress
in
short
they
sometimes
went
faster
than
they
liked
and
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
their
feet
but
hope
gave
them
strength
for
it
was
not
at
random
that
they
made
their
way
along
the
shore
they
had
no
doubt
that
neb
had
found
his
master
and
that
he
had
sent
them
the
faithful
dog
but
was
the
engineer
living
or
had
neb
only
sent
for
his
companions
that
they
might
render
the
last
duties
to
the
corpse
of
the
unfortunate
harding
after
having
passed
the
precipice
herbert
the
reporter
and
pencroft
prudently
stepped
aside
to
stop
and
take
breath
the
turn
of
the
rocks
sheltered
them
from
the
wind
and
they
could
breathe
after
this
walk
or
rather
run
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
could
now
hear
and
reply
to
each
other
and
the
lad
having
pronounced
the
name
of
cyrus
harding
top
gave
a
few
short
barks
as
much
as
to
say
that
his
master
was
saved
saved
isnt
he
repeated
herbert
saved
top
and
the
dog
barked
in
reply
they
once
more
set
out
the
tide
began
to
rise
and
urged
by
the
wind
it
threatened
to
be
unusually
high
as
it
was
a
spring
tide
great
billows
thundered
against
the
reef
with
such
violence
that
they
probably
passed
entirely
over
the
islet
then
quite
invisible
the
mole
no
longer
protected
the
coast
which
was
directly
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
the
open
sea
as
soon
as
the
sailor
and
his
companions
left
the
precipice
the
wind
struck
them
again
with
renewed
fury
though
bent
under
the
gale
they
walked
very
quickly
following
top
who
did
not
hesitate
as
to
what
direction
to
take
they
ascended
towards
the
north
having
on
their
left
an
interminable
extent
of
billows
which
broke
with
a
deafening
noise
and
on
their
right
a
dark
country
the
aspect
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
guess
but
they
felt
that
it
was
comparatively
flat
for
the
wind
passed
completely
over
them
without
being
driven
back
as
it
was
when
it
came
in
contact
with
the
cliff
at
four
oclock
in
the
morning
they
reckoned
that
they
had
cleared
about
five
miles
the
clouds
were
slightly
raised
and
the
wind
though
less
damp
was
very
sharp
and
cold
insufficiently
protected
by
their
clothing
pencroft
herbert
and
spilett
suffered
cruelly
but
not
a
complaint
escaped
their
lips
they
were
determined
to
follow
top
wherever
the
intelligent
animal
wished
to
lead
them
towards
five
oclock
day
began
to
break
at
the
zenith
where
the
fog
was
less
thick
gray
shades
bordered
the
clouds
under
an
opaque
belt
a
luminous
line
clearly
traced
the
horizon
the
crests
of
the
billows
were
tipped
with
a
wild
light
and
the
foam
regained
its
whiteness
at
the
same
time
on
the
left
the
hilly
parts
of
the
coast
could
be
seen
though
very
indistinctly
at
six
oclock
day
had
broken
the
clouds
rapidly
lifted
the
seaman
and
his
companions
were
then
about
six
miles
from
the
chimneys
they
were
following
a
very
flat
shore
bounded
by
a
reef
of
rocks
whose
heads
scarcely
emerged
from
the
sea
for
they
were
in
deep
water
on
the
left
the
country
appeared
to
be
one
vast
extent
of
sandy
downs
bristling
with
thistles
there
was
no
cliff
and
the
shore
offered
no
resistance
to
the
ocean
but
a
chain
of
irregular
hillocks
here
and
there
grew
two
or
three
trees
inclined
towards
the
west
their
branches
projecting
in
that
direction
quite
behind
in
the
southwest
extended
the
border
of
the
forest
at
this
moment
top
became
very
excited
he
ran
forward
then
returned
and
seemed
to
entreat
them
to
hasten
their
steps
the
dog
then
left
the
beach
and
guided
by
his
wonderful
instinct
without
showing
the
least
hesitation
went
straight
in
among
the
downs
they
followed
him
the
country
appeared
an
absolute
desert
not
a
living
creature
was
to
be
seen
the
downs
the
extent
of
which
was
large
were
composed
of
hillocks
and
even
of
hills
very
irregularly
distributed
they
resembled
a
switzerland
modeled
in
sand
and
only
an
amazing
instinct
could
have
possibly
recognized
the
way
five
minutes
after
having
left
the
beach
the
reporter
and
his
two
companions
arrived
at
a
sort
of
excavation
hollowed
out
at
the
back
of
a
high
mound
there
top
stopped
and
gave
a
loud
clear
bark
spilett
herbert
and
pencroft
dashed
into
the
cave
neb
was
there
kneeling
beside
a
body
extended
on
a
bed
of
grass
the
body
was
that
of

spilett
and
the
sailor
turned
pale
herbert
clasped
his
hands
and
remained
motionless
the
poor
negro
absorbed
in
his
grief
evidently
had
neither
seen
his
companions
nor
heard
the
sailor
speak
the
reporter
knelt
down
beside
the
motionless
body
and
placed
his
ear
to
the
engineers
chest
having
first
torn
open
his
clothes
a
minutean

during
which
he
endeavored
to
catch
the
faintest
throb
of
the
heart
neb
had
raised
himself
a
little
and
gazed
without
seeing
despair
had
completely
changed
his
countenance
he
could
scarcely
be
recognized
exhausted
with
fatigue
broken

believed
his

was
dead

after
a
long
and
attentive
examination

said
he
pencroft
knelt
in
his
turn
beside
the
engineer
he
also
heard
a
throbbing
and
even
felt
a
slight
breath
on
his
cheek
herbert
at
a
word
from
the
reporter
ran
out
to
look
for
water
he
found
a
hundred
feet
off
a
limpid
stream
which
seemed
to
have
been
greatly
increased
by
the
rains
and
which
filtered
through
the
sand
but
nothing
in
which
to
put
the
water
not
even
a
shell
among
the
downs
the
lad
was
obliged
to
content
himself
with
dipping
his
handkerchief
in
the
stream
and
with
it
hastened
back
to
the
grotto
happily
the
wet
handkerchief
was
enough
for
gideon
spilett
who
only
wished
to
wet
the
engineers
lips
the
cold
water
produced
an
almost
immediate
effect
his
chest
heaved
and
he
seemed
to
try
to
speak
we
will
save
him
exclaimed
the
reporter
at
these
words
hope
revived
in
nebs
heart
he
undressed
his
master
to
see
if
he
was
wounded
but
not
so
much
as
a
bruise
was
to
be
found
either
on
the
head
body
or
limbs
which
was
surprising
as
he
must
have
been
dashed
against
the
rocks
even
the
hands
were
uninjured
and
it
was
difficult
to
explain
how
the
engineer
showed
no
traces
of
the
efforts
which
he
must
have
made
to
get
out
of
reach
of
the
breakers
but
the
explanation
would
come
later
when
cyrus
was
able
to
speak
he
would
say
what
had
happened
for
the
present
the
question
was
how
to
recall
him
to
life
and
it
appeared
likely
that
rubbing
would
bring
this
about
so
they
set
to
work
with
the
sailors
jersey
the
engineer
revived
by
this
rude
shampooing
moved
his
arm
slightly
and
began
to
breathe
more
regularly
he
was
sinking
from
exhaustion
and
certainly
had
not
the
reporter
and
his
companions
arrived
it
would
have
been
all
over
with
cyrus
harding
you
thought
your
master
was
dead
didnt
you
said
the
seaman
to
neb
yes
quite
dead
replied
neb
and
if
top
had
not
found
you
and
brought
you
here
i
should
have
buried
my
master
and
then
have
lain
down
on
his
grave
to
die
it
had
indeed
been
a
narrow
escape
for
cyrus
harding
neb
then
recounted
what
had
happened
the
day
before
after
having
left
the
chimneys
at
daybreak
he
had
ascended
the
coast
in
a
northerly
direction
and
had
reached
that
part
of
the
shore
which
he
had
already
visited
there
without
any
hope
he
acknowledged
neb
had
searched
the
beach
among
the
rocks
on
the
sand
for
the
smallest
trace
to
guide
him
he
examined
particularly
that
part
of
the
beach
which
was
not
covered
by
the
high
tide
for
near
the
sea
the
water
would
have
obliterated
all
marks
neb
did
not
expect
to
find
his
master
living
it
was
for
a
corpse
that
he
searched
a
corpse
which
he
wished
to
bury
with
his
own
hands
he
sought
long
in
vain
this
desert
coast
appeared
never
to
have
been
visited
by
a
human
creature
the
shells
those
which
the
sea
had
not
reached
and
which
might
be
met
with
by
millions
above
highwater
mark
were
untouched
not
a
shell
was
broken
neb
then
resolved
to
walk
along
the
beach
for
some
miles
it
was
possible
that
the
waves
had
carried
the
body
to
quite
a
distant
point
when
a
corpse
floats
a
little
distance
from
a
low
shore
it
rarely
happens
that
the
tide
does
not
throw
it
up
sooner
or
later
this
neb
knew
and
he
wished
to
see
his
master
again
for
the
last
time
i
went
along
the
coast
for
another
two
miles
carefully
examining
the
beach
both
at
high
and
low
water
and
i
had
despaired
of
finding
anything
when
yesterday
above
five
in
the
evening
i
saw
footprints
on
the
sand
footprints
exclaimed
pencroft
yes
replied
neb
did
these
footprints
begin
at
the
waters
edge
asked
the
reporter
no
replied
neb
only
above
highwater
mark
for
the
others
must
have
been
washed
out
by
the
tide
go
on
neb
said
spilett
i
went
half
crazy
when
i
saw
these
footprints
they
were
very
clear
and
went
towards
the
downs
i
followed
them
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
running
but
taking
care
not
to
destroy
them
five
minutes
after
as
it
was
getting
dark
i
heard
the
barking
of
a
dog
it
was
top
and
top
brought
me
here
to
my
master
neb
ended
his
account
by
saying
what
had
been
his
grief
at
finding
the
inanimate
body
in
which
he
vainly
sought
for
the
least
sign
of
life
now
that
he
had
found
him
dead
he
longed
for
him
to
be
alive
all
his
efforts
were
useless
nothing
remained
to
be
done
but
to
render
the
last
duties
to
the
one
whom
he
had
loved
so
much
neb
then
thought
of
his
companions
they
no
doubt
would
wish
to
see
the
unfortunate
man
again
top
was
there
could
he
not
rely
on
the
sagacity
of
the
faithful
animal
neb
several
times
pronounced
the
name
of
the
reporter
the
one
among
his
companions
whom
top
knew
best
then
he
pointed
to
the
south
and
the
dog
bounded
off
in
the
direction
indicated
to
him
we
have
heard
how
guided
by
an
instinct
which
might
be
looked
upon
almost
as
supernatural
top
had
found
them
nebs
companions
had
listened
with
great
attention
to
this
account
it
was
unaccountable
to
them
how
cyrus
harding
after
the
efforts
which
he
must
have
made
to
escape
from
the
waves
by
crossing
the
rocks
had
not
received
even
a
scratch
and
what
could
not
be
explained
either
was
how
the
engineer
had
managed
to
get
to
this
cave
in
the
downs
more
than
a
mile
from
the
shore
so
neb
said
the
reporter
it
was
not
you
who
brought
your
master
to
this
place
no
it
was
not
i
replied
the
negro
its
very
clear
that
the
captain
came
here
by
himself
said
pencroft
it
is
clear
in
reality
observed
spilett
but
it
is
not
credible
the
explanation
of
this
fact
could
only
be
produced
from
the
engineers
own
lips
and
they
must
wait
for
that
till
speech
returned
rubbing
had
reestablished
the
circulation
of
the
blood
cyrus
harding
moved
his
arm
again
then
his
head
and
a
few
incomprehensible
words
escaped
him
neb
who
was
bending
over
him
spoke
but
the
engineer
did
not
appear
to
hear
and
his
eyes
remained
closed
life
was
only
exhibited
in
him
by
movement
his
senses
had
not
as
yet
been
restored
pencroft
much
regretted
not
having
either
fire
or
the
means
of
procuring
it
for
he
had
unfortunately
forgotten
to
bring
the
burnt
linen
which
would
easily
have
ignited
from
the
sparks
produced
by
striking
together
two
flints
as
to
the
engineers
pockets
they
were
entirely
empty
except
that
of
his
waistcoat
which
contained
his
watch
it
was
necessary
to
carry
harding
to
the
chimneys
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
this
was
the
opinion
of
all
meanwhile
the
care
which
was
lavished
on
the
engineer
brought
him
back
to
consciousness
sooner
than
they
could
have
expected
the
water
with
which
they
wetted
his
lips
revived
him
gradually
pencroft
also
thought
of
mixing
with
the
water
some
moisture
from
the
titras
flesh
which
he
had
brought
herbert
ran
to
the
beach
and
returned
with
two
large
bivalve
shells
the
sailor
concocted
something
which
he
introduced
between
the
lips
of
the
engineer
who
eagerly
drinking
it
opened
his
eyes
neb
and
the
reporter
were
leaning
over
him
my
master
my
master
cried
neb
the
engineer
heard
him
he
recognized
neb
and
spilett
then
his
other
two
companions
and
his
hand
slightly
pressed
theirs
a
few
words
again
escaped
him
which
showed
what
thoughts
were
even
then
troubling
his
brain
this
time
he
was
understood
undoubtedly
they
were
the
same
words
he
had
before
attempted
to
utter
island
or
continent
he
murmured
bother
the
continent
cried
pencroft
hastily
there
is
time
enough
to
see
about
that
captain
we
dont
care
for
anything
provided
you
are
living
the
engineer
nodded
faintly
and
then
appeared
to
sleep
they
respected
this
sleep
and
the
reporter
began
immediately
to
make
arrangements
for
transporting
harding
to
a
more
comfortable
place
neb
herbert
and
pencroft
left
the
cave
and
directed
their
steps
towards
a
high
mound
crowned
with
a
few
distorted
trees
on
the
way
the
sailor
could
not
help
repeating
island
or
continent
to
think
of
that
when
at
ones
last
gasp
what
a
man
arrived
at
the
summit
of
the
mound
pencroft
and
his
two
companions
set
to
work
with
no
other
tools
than
their
hands
to
despoil
of
its
principal
branches
a
rather
sickly
tree
a
sort
of
marine
fir
with
these
branches
they
made
a
litter
on
which
covered
with
grass
and
leaves
they
could
carry
the
engineer
this
occupied
them
nearly
forty
minutes
and
it
was
ten
oclock
when
they
returned
to
cyrus
harding
whom
spilett
had
not
left
the
engineer
was
just
awaking
from
the
sleep
or
rather
from
the
drowsiness
in
which
they
had
found
him
the
color
was
returning
to
his
cheeks
which
till
now
had
been
as
pale
as
death
he
raised
himself
a
little
looked
around
him
and
appeared
to
ask
where
he
was
can
you
listen
to
me
without
fatigue
cyrus
asked
the
reporter
yes
replied
the
engineer
its
my
opinion
said
the
sailor
that
captain
harding
will
be
able
to
listen
to
you
still
better
if
he
will
have
some
more
grouse
jellyfor
we
have
grouse
captain
added
he
presenting
him
with
a
little
of
this
jelly
to
which
he
this
time
added
some
of
the
flesh
cyrus
harding
ate
a
little
of
the
grouse
and
the
rest
was
divided
among
his
companions
who
found
it
but
a
meager
breakfast
for
they
were
suffering
extremely
from
hunger
well
said
the
sailor
there
is
plenty
of
food
at
the
chimneys
for
you
must
know
captain
that
down
there
in
the
south
we
have
a
house
with
rooms
beds
and
fireplace
and
in
the
pantry
several
dozen
of
birds
which
our
herbert
calls
couroucous
your
litter
is
ready
and
as
soon
as
you
feel
strong
enough
we
will
carry
you
home
thanks
my
friend
replied
the
engineer
wait
another
hour
or
two
and
then
we
will
set
out
and
now
speak
spilett
the
reporter
then
told
him
all
that
had
occurred
he
recounted
all
the
events
with
which
cyrus
was
unacquainted
the
last
fall
of
the
balloon
the
landing
on
this
unknown
land
which
appeared
a
desert
whatever
it
was
whether
island
or
continent
the
discovery
of
the
chimneys
the
search
for
him
not
forgetting
of
course
nebs
devotion
the
intelligence
exhibited
by
the
faithful
top
as
well
as
many
other
matters
but
asked
harding
in
a
still
feeble
voice
you
did
not
then
pick
me
up
on
the
beach
no
replied
the
reporter
and
did
you
not
bring
me
to
this
cave
no
at
what
distance
is
this
cave
from
the
sea
about
a
mile
replied
pencroft
and
if
you
are
astonished
captain
we
are
not
less
surprised
ourselves
at
seeing
you
in
this
place
indeed
said
the
engineer
who
was
recovering
gradually
and
who
took
great
interest
in
these
details
indeed
it
is
very
singular
but
resumed
the
sailor
can
you
tell
us
what
happened
after
you
were
carried
off
by
the
sea
cyrus
harding
considered
he
knew
very
little
the
wave
had
torn
him
from
the
balloon
net
he
sank
at
first
several
fathoms
on
returning
to
the
surface
in
the
half
light
he
felt
a
living
creature
struggling
near
him
it
was
top
who
had
sprung
to
his
help
he
saw
nothing
of
the
balloon
which
lightened
both
of
his
weight
and
that
of
the
dog
had
darted
away
like
an
arrow
there
he
was
in
the
midst
of
the
angry
sea
at
a
distance
which
could
not
be
less
than
half
a
mile
from
the
shore
he
attempted
to
struggle
against
the
billows
by
swimming
vigorously
top
held
him
up
by
his
clothes
but
a
strong
current
seized
him
and
drove
him
towards
the
north
and
after
half
an
hour
of
exertion
he
sank
dragging
top
with
him
into
the
depths
from
that
moment
to
the
moment
in
which
he
recovered
to
find
himself
in
the
arms
of
his
friends
he
remembered
nothing
however
remarked
pencroft
you
must
have
been
thrown
on
to
the
beach
and
you
must
have
had
strength
to
walk
here
since
neb
found
your
footmarks
yes
of
course
replied
the
engineer
thoughtfully
and
you
found
no
traces
of
human
beings
on
this
coast
not
a
trace
replied
the
reporter
besides
if
by
chance
you
had
met
with
some
deliverer
there
just
in
the
nick
of
time
why
should
he
have
abandoned
you
after
having
saved
you
from
the
waves
you
are
right
my
dear
spilett
tell
me
neb
added
the
engineer
turning
to
his
servant
it
was
not
you
who
you
cant
have
had
a
moment
of
unconsciousness
during
which
no
thats
absurd
do
any
of
the
footsteps
still
remain
asked
harding
yes
master
replied
neb
here
at
the
entrance
at
the
back
of
the
mound
in
a
place
sheltered
from
the
rain
and
wind
the
storm
has
destroyed
the
others
pencroft
said
cyrus
harding
will
you
take
my
shoe
and
see
if
it
fits
exactly
to
the
footprints
the
sailor
did
as
the
engineer
requested
while
he
and
herbert
guided
by
neb
went
to
the
place
where
the
footprints
were
to
be
found
cyrus
remarked
to
the
reporter
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
thing
perfectly
inexplicable
replied
gideon
spilett
but
do
not
dwell
upon
it
just
now
my
dear
spilett
we
will
talk
about
it
byandby
a
moment
after
the
others
entered
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
engineers
shoe
fitted
exactly
to
the
footmarks
it
was
therefore
cyrus
harding
who
had
left
them
on
the
sand
come
said
he
i
must
have
experienced
this
unconsciousness
which
i
attributed
to
neb
i
must
have
walked
like
a
somnambulist
without
any
knowledge
of
my
steps
and
top
must
have
guided
me
here
after
having
dragged
me
from
the
waves
come
top
come
old
dog
the
magnificent
animal
bounded
barking
to
his
master
and
caresses
were
lavished
on
him
it
was
agreed
that
there
was
no
other
way
of
accounting
for
the
rescue
of
cyrus
harding
and
that
top
deserved
all
the
honor
of
the
affair
towards
twelve
oclock
pencroft
having
asked
the
engineer
if
they
could
now
remove
him
harding
instead
of
replying
and
by
an
effort
which
exhibited
the
most
energetic
will
got
up
but
he
was
obliged
to
lean
on
the
sailor
or
he
would
have
fallen
well
done
cried
pencroft
bring
the
captains
litter
the
litter
was
brought
the
transverse
branches
had
been
covered
with
leaves
and
long
grass
harding
was
laid
on
it
and
pencroft
having
taken
his
place
at
one
end
and
neb
at
the
other
they
started
towards
the
coast
there
was
a
distance
of
eight
miles
to
be
accomplished
but
as
they
could
not
go
fast
and
it
would
perhaps
be
necessary
to
stop
frequently
they
reckoned
that
it
would
take
at
least
six
hours
to
reach
the
chimneys
the
wind
was
still
strong
but
fortunately
it
did
not
rain
although
lying
down
the
engineer
leaning
on
his
elbow
observed
the
coast
particularly
inland
he
did
not
speak
but
he
gazed
and
no
doubt
the
appearance
of
the
country
with
its
inequalities
of
ground
its
forests
its
various
productions
were
impressed
on
his
mind
however
after
traveling
for
two
hours
fatigue
overcame
him
and
he
slept
at
halfpast
five
the
little
band
arrived
at
the
precipice
and
a
short
time
after
at
the
chimneys
they
stopped
and
the
litter
was
placed
on
the
sand
cyrus
harding
was
sleeping
profoundly
and
did
not
awake
pencroft
to
his
extreme
surprise
found
that
the
terrible
storm
had
quite
altered
the
aspect
of
the
place
important
changes
had
occurred
great
blocks
of
stone
lay
on
the
beach
which
was
also
covered
with
a
thick
carpet
of
seaweed
algae
and
wrack
evidently
the
sea
passing
over
the
islet
had
been
carried
right
up
to
the
foot
of
the
enormous
curtain
of
granite
the
soil
in
front
of
the
cave
had
been
torn
away
by
the
violence
of
the
waves
a
horrid
presentiment
flashed
across
pencrofts
mind
he
rushed
into
the
passage
but
returned
almost
immediately
and
stood
motionless
staring
at
his
companions
the
fire
was
out
the
drowned
cinders
were
nothing
but
mud
the
burnt
linen
which
was
to
have
served
as
tinder
had
disappeared
the
sea
had
penetrated
to
the
end
of
the
passages
and
everything
was
overthrown
and
destroyed
in
the
interior
of
the
chimneys
chapter

in
a
few
words
gideon
spilett
herbert
and
neb
were
made
acquainted
with
what
had
happened
this
accident
which
appeared
so
very
serious
to
pencroft
produced
different
effects
on
the
companions
of
the
honest
sailor
neb
in
his
delight
at
having
found
his
master
did
not
listen
or
rather
did
not
care
to
trouble
himself
with
what
pencroft
was
saying
herbert
shared
in
some
degree
the
sailors
feelings
as
to
the
reporter
he
simply
replied
upon
my
word
pencroft
its
perfectly
indifferent
to
me
but
i
repeat
that
we
havent
any
fire
pooh
nor
any
means
of
relighting
it
nonsense
but
i
say
mr
spilett
isnt
cyrus
here
replied
the
reporter
is
not
our
engineer
alive
he
will
soon
find
some
way
of
making
fire
for
us
with
what
with
nothing
what
had
pencroft
to
say
he
could
say
nothing
for
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
shared
the
confidence
which
his
companions
had
in
cyrus
harding
the
engineer
was
to
them
a
microcosm
a
compound
of
every
science
a
possessor
of
all
human
knowledge
it
was
better
to
be
with
cyrus
in
a
desert
island
than
without
him
in
the
most
flourishing
town
in
the
united
states
with
him
they
could
want
nothing
with
him
they
would
never
despair
if
these
brave
men
had
been
told
that
a
volcanic
eruption
would
destroy
the
land
that
this
land
would
be
engulfed
in
the
depths
of
the
pacific
they
would
have
imperturbably
replied
cyrus
is
here
while
in
the
palanquin
however
the
engineer
had
again
relapsed
into
unconsciousness
which
the
jolting
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
during
his
journey
had
brought
on
so
that
they
could
not
now
appeal
to
his
ingenuity
the
supper
must
necessarily
be
very
meager
in
fact
all
the
grouse
flesh
had
been
consumed
and
there
no
longer
existed
any
means
of
cooking
more
game
besides
the
couroucous
which
had
been
reserved
had
disappeared
they
must
consider
what
was
to
be
done
first
of
all
cyrus
harding
was
carried
into
the
central
passage
there
they
managed
to
arrange
for
him
a
couch
of
seaweed
which
still
remained
almost
dry
the
deep
sleep
which
had
overpowered
him
would
no
doubt
be
more
beneficial
to
him
than
any
nourishment
night
had
closed
in
and
the
temperature
which
had
modified
when
the
wind
shifted
to
the
northwest
again
became
extremely
cold
also
the
sea
having
destroyed
the
partitions
which
pencroft
had
put
up
in
certain
places
in
the
passages
the
chimneys
on
account
of
the
draughts
had
become
scarcely
habitable
the
engineers
condition
would
therefore
have
been
bad
enough
if
his
companions
had
not
carefully
covered
him
with
their
coats
and
waistcoats
supper
this
evening
was
of
course
composed
of
the
inevitable
lithodomes
of
which
herbert
and
neb
picked
up
a
plentiful
supply
on
the
beach
however
to
these
molluscs
the
lad
added
some
edible
seaweed
which
he
gathered
on
high
rocks
whose
sides
were
only
washed
by
the
sea
at
the
time
of
high
tides
this
seaweed
which
belongs
to
the
order
of
fucacae
of
the
genus
sargassum
produces
when
dry
a
gelatinous
matter
rich
and
nutritious
the
reporter
and
his
companions
after
having
eaten
a
quantity
of
lithodomes
sucked
the
sargassum
of
which
the
taste
was
very
tolerable
it
is
used
in
parts
of
the
east
very
considerably
by
the
natives
never
mind
said
the
sailor
the
captain
will
help
us
soon
meanwhile
the
cold
became
very
severe
and
unhappily
they
had
no
means
of
defending
themselves
from
it
the
sailor
extremely
vexed
tried
in
all
sorts
of
ways
to
procure
fire
neb
helped
him
in
this
work
he
found
some
dry
moss
and
by
striking
together
two
pebbles
he
obtained
some
sparks
but
the
moss
not
being
inflammable
enough
did
not
take
fire
for
the
sparks
were
really
only
incandescent
and
not
at
all
of
the
same
consistency
as
those
which
are
emitted
from
flint
when
struck
in
the
same
manner
the
experiment
therefore
did
not
succeed
pencroft
although
he
had
no
confidence
in
the
proceeding
then
tried
rubbing
two
pieces
of
dry
wood
together
as
savages
do
certainly
the
movement
which
he
and
neb
exhibited
if
it
had
been
transformed
into
heat
according
to
the
new
theory
would
have
been
enough
to
heat
the
boiler
of
a
steamer
it
came
to
nothing
the
bits
of
wood
became
hot
to
be
sure
but
much
less
so
than
the
operators
themselves
after
working
an
hour
pencroft
who
was
in
a
complete
state
of
perspiration
threw
down
the
pieces
of
wood
in
disgust
i
can
never
be
made
to
believe
that
savages
light
their
fires
in
this
way
let
them
say
what
they
will
he
exclaimed
i
could
sooner
light
my
arms
by
rubbing
them
against
each
other
the
sailor
was
wrong
to
despise
the
proceeding
savages
often
kindle
wood
by
means
of
rapid
rubbing
but
every
sort
of
wood
does
not
answer
for
the
purpose
and
besides
there
is
the
knack
following
the
usual
expression
and
it
is
probable
that
pencroft
had
not
the
knack
pencrofts
ill
humor
did
not
last
long
herbert
had
taken
the
bits
of
wood
which
he
had
turned
down
and
was
exerting
himself
to
rub
them
the
hardy
sailor
could
not
restrain
a
burst
of
laughter
on
seeing
the
efforts
of
the
lad
to
succeed
where
he
had
failed
rub
my
boy
rub
said
he
i
am
rubbing
replied
herbert
laughing
but
i
dont
pretend
to
do
anything
else
but
warm
myself
instead
of
shivering
and
soon
i
shall
be
as
hot
as
you
are
my
good
pencroft
this
soon
happened
however
they
were
obliged
to
give
up
for
this
night
at
least
the
attempt
to
procure
fire
gideon
spilett
repeated
for
the
twentieth
time
that
cyrus
harding
would
not
have
been
troubled
for
so
small
a
difficulty
and
in
the
meantime
he
stretched
himself
in
one
of
the
passages
on
his
bed
of
sand
herbert
neb
and
pencroft
did
the
same
while
top
slept
at
his
masters
feet
next
day
the
28th
of
march
when
the
engineer
awoke
about
eight
in
the
morning
he
saw
his
companions
around
him
watching
his
sleep
and
as
on
the
day
before
his
first
words
were
island
or
continent
this
was
his
uppermost
thought
well
replied
pencroft
we
dont
know
anything
about
it
captain
you
dont
know
yet
but
we
shall
know
rejoined
pencroft
when
you
have
guided
us
into
the
country
i
think
i
am
able
to
try
it
replied
the
engineer
who
without
much
effort
rose
and
stood
upright
thats
capital
cried
the
sailor
i
feel
dreadfully
weak
replied
harding
give
me
something
to
eat
my
friends
and
it
will
soon
go
off
you
have
fire
havent
you
this
question
was
not
immediately
replied
to
but
in
a
few
seconds
alas
we
have
no
fire
said
pencroft
or
rather
captain
we
have
it
no
longer
and
the
sailor
recounted
all
that
had
passed
the
day
before
he
amused
the
engineer
by
the
history
of
the
single
match
then
his
abortive
attempt
to
procure
fire
in
the
savages
way
we
shall
consider
replied
the
engineer
and
if
we
do
not
find
some
substance
similar
to
tinder
well
asked
the
sailor
well
we
will
make
matches
chemicals
chemicals
it
is
not
more
difficult
than
that
cried
the
reporter
striking
the
sailor
on
the
shoulder
the
latter
did
not
think
it
so
simple
but
he
did
not
protest
all
went
out
the
weather
had
become
very
fine
the
sun
was
rising
from
the
seas
horizon
and
touched
with
golden
spangles
the
prismatic
rugosities
of
the
huge
precipice
having
thrown
a
rapid
glance
around
him
the
engineer
seated
himself
on
a
block
of
stone
herbert
offered
him
a
few
handfuls
of
shellfish
and
sargassum
saying
it
is
all
that
we
have
captain
harding
thanks
my
boy
replied
harding
it
will
dofor
this
morning
at
least
he
ate
the
wretched
food
with
appetite
and
washed
it
down
with
a
little
fresh
water
drawn
from
the
river
in
an
immense
shell
his
companions
looked
at
him
without
speaking
then
feeling
somewhat
refreshed
cyrus
harding
crossed
his
arms
and
said
so
my
friends
you
do
not
know
yet
whether
fate
has
thrown
us
on
an
island
or
on
a
continent
no
captain
replied
the
boy
we
shall
know
tomorrow
said
the
engineer
till
then
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
yes
replied
pencroft
what
fire
said
the
sailor
who
also
had
a
fixed
idea
we
will
make
it
pencroft
replied
harding
while
you
were
carrying
me
yesterday
did
i
not
see
in
the
west
a
mountain
which
commands
the
country
yes
replied
spilett
a
mountain
which
must
be
rather
high
well
replied
the
engineer
we
will
climb
to
the
summit
tomorrow
and
then
we
shall
see
if
this
land
is
an
island
or
a
continent
till
then
i
repeat
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
yes
fire
said
the
obstinate
sailor
again
but
he
will
make
us
a
fire
replied
gideon
spilett
only
have
a
little
patience
pencroft
the
seaman
looked
at
spilett
in
a
way
which
seemed
to
say
if
it
depended
upon
you
to
do
it
we
wouldnt
taste
roast
meat
very
soon
but
he
was
silent
meanwhile
captain
harding
had
made
no
reply
he
appeared
to
be
very
little
troubled
by
the
question
of
fire
for
a
few
minutes
he
remained
absorbed
in
thought
then
again
speaking
my
friends
said
he
our
situation
is
perhaps
deplorable
but
at
any
rate
it
is
very
plain
either
we
are
on
a
continent
and
then
at
the
expense
of
greater
or
less
fatigue
we
shall
reach
some
inhabited
place
or
we
are
on
an
island
in
the
latter
case
if
the
island
is
inhabited
we
will
try
to
get
out
of
the
scrape
with
the
help
of
its
inhabitants
if
it
is
desert
we
will
try
to
get
out
of
the
scrape
by
ourselves
certainly
nothing
could
be
plainer
replied
pencroft
but
whether
it
is
an
island
or
a
continent
asked
gideon
spilett
whereabouts
do
you
think
cyrus
this
storm
has
thrown
us
i
cannot
say
exactly
replied
the
engineer
but
i
presume
it
is
some
land
in
the
pacific
in
fact
when
we
left
richmond
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
northeast
and
its
very
violence
greatly
proves
that
it
could
not
have
varied
if
the
direction
has
been
maintained
from
the
northeast
to
the
southwest
we
have
traversed
the
states
of
north
carolina
of
south
carolina
of
georgia
the
gulf
of
mexico
mexico
itself
in
its
narrow
part
then
a
part
of
the
pacific
ocean
i
cannot
estimate
the
distance
traversed
by
the
balloon
at
less
than
six
to
seven
thousand
miles
and
even
supposing
that
the
wind
had
varied
half
a
quarter
it
must
have
brought
us
either
to
the
archipelago
of
mendava
either
on
the
pomotous
or
even
if
it
had
a
greater
strength
than
i
suppose
to
the
land
of
new
zealand
if
the
last
hypothesis
is
correct
it
will
be
easy
enough
to
get
home
again
english
or
maoris
we
shall
always
find
some
one
to
whom
we
can
speak
if
on
the
contrary
this
is
the
coast
of
a
desert
island
in
some
tiny
archipelago
perhaps
we
shall
be
able
to
reconnoiter
it
from
the
summit
of
that
peak
which
overlooks
the
country
and
then
we
shall
see
how
best
to
establish
ourselves
here
as
if
we
are
never
to
go
away
never
cried
the
reporter
you
say
never
my
dear
cyrus
better
to
put
things
at
the
worst
at
first
replied
the
engineer
and
reserve
the
best
for
a
surprise
well
said
remarked
pencroft
it
is
to
be
hoped
too
that
this
island
if
it
be
one
is
not
situated
just
out
of
the
course
of
ships
that
would
be
really
unlucky
we
shall
not
know
what
we
have
to
rely
on
until
we
have
first
made
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
replied
the
engineer
but
tomorrow
captain
asked
herbert
shall
you
be
in
a
state
to
bear
the
fatigue
of
the
ascent
i
hope
so
replied
the
engineer
provided
you
and
pencroft
my
boy
show
yourselves
quick
and
clever
hunters
captain
said
the
sailor
since
you
are
speaking
of
game
if
on
my
return
i
was
as
certain
of
roasting
it
as
i
am
of
bringing
it
back
bring
it
back
all
the
same
pencroft
replied
harding
it
was
then
agreed
that
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
were
to
pass
the
day
at
the
chimneys
so
as
to
examine
the
shore
and
the
upper
plateau
neb
herbert
and
the
sailor
were
to
return
to
the
forest
renew
their
store
of
wood
and
lay
violent
hands
on
every
creature
feathered
or
hairy
which
might
come
within
their
reach
they
set
out
accordingly
about
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
herbert
confident
neb
joyous
pencroft
murmuring
aside
if
on
my
return
i
find
a
fire
at
the
house
i
shall
believe
that
the
thunder
itself
came
to
light
it
all
three
climbed
the
bank
and
arrived
at
the
angle
made
by
the
river
the
sailor
stopping
said
to
his
two
companions
shall
we
begin
by
being
hunters
or
woodmen
hunters
replied
herbert
there
is
top
already
in
quest
we
will
hunt
then
said
the
sailor
and
afterwards
we
can
come
back
and
collect
our
wood
this
agreed
to
herbert
neb
and
pencroft
after
having
torn
three
sticks
from
the
trunk
of
a
young
fir
followed
top
who
was
bounding
about
among
the
long
grass
this
time
the
hunters
instead
of
following
the
course
of
the
river
plunged
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
there
were
still
the
same
trees
belonging
for
the
most
part
to
the
pine
family
in
certain
places
less
crowded
growing
in
clumps
these
pines
exhibited
considerable
dimensions
and
appeared
to
indicate
by
their
development
that
the
country
was
situated
in
a
higher
latitude
than
the
engineer
had
supposed
glades
bristling
with
stumps
worn
away
by
time
were
covered
with
dry
wood
which
formed
an
inexhaustible
store
of
fuel
then
the
glade
passed
the
underwood
thickened
again
and
became
almost
impenetrable
it
was
difficult
enough
to
find
the
way
among
the
groups
of
trees
without
any
beaten
track
so
the
sailor
from
time
to
time
broke
off
branches
which
might
be
easily
recognized
but
perhaps
he
was
wrong
not
to
follow
the
watercourse
as
he
and
herbert
had
done
on
their
first
excursion
for
after
walking
an
hour
not
a
creature
had
shown
itself
top
running
under
the
branches
only
roused
birds
which
could
not
be
approached
even
the
couroucous
were
invisible
and
it
was
probable
that
the
sailor
would
be
obliged
to
return
to
the
marshy
part
of
the
forest
in
which
he
had
so
happily
performed
his
grouse
fishing
well
pencroft
said
neb
in
a
slightly
sarcastic
tone
if
this
is
all
the
game
which
you
promised
to
bring
back
to
my
master
it
wont
need
a
large
fire
to
roast
it
have
patience
replied
the
sailor
it
isnt
the
game
which
will
be
wanting
on
our
return
have
you
not
confidence
in
captain
harding
yes
but
you
dont
believe
that
he
will
make
fire
i
shall
believe
it
when
the
wood
is
blazing
in
the
fireplace
it
will
blaze
since
my
master
has
said
so
we
shall
see
meanwhile
the
sun
had
not
reached
the
highest
point
in
its
course
above
the
horizon
the
exploration
therefore
continued
and
was
usefully
marked
by
a
discovery
which
herbert
made
of
a
tree
whose
fruit
was
edible
this
was
the
stonepine
which
produces
an
excellent
almond
very
much
esteemed
in
the
temperate
regions
of
america
and
europe
these
almonds
were
in
a
perfect
state
of
maturity
and
herbert
described
them
to
his
companions
who
feasted
on
them
come
said
pencroft
seaweed
by
way
of
bread
raw
mussels
for
meat
and
almonds
for
dessert
thats
certainly
a
good
dinner
for
those
who
have
not
a
single
match
in
their
pocket
we
mustnt
complain
said
herbert
i
am
not
complaining
my
boy
replied
pencroft
only
i
repeat
that
meat
is
a
little
too
much
economized
in
this
sort
of
meal
top
has
found
something
cried
neb
who
ran
towards
a
thicket
in
the
midst
of
which
the
dog
had
disappeared
barking
with
tops
barking
were
mingled
curious
gruntings
the
sailor
and
herbert
had
followed
neb
if
there
was
game
there
this
was
not
the
time
to
discuss
how
it
was
to
be
cooked
but
rather
how
they
were
to
get
hold
of
it
the
hunters
had
scarcely
entered
the
bushes
when
they
saw
top
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
an
animal
which
he
was
holding
by
the
ear
this
quadruped
was
a
sort
of
pig
nearly
two
feet
and
a
half
long
of
a
blackish
brown
color
lighter
below
having
hard
scanty
hair
its
toes
then
strongly
fixed
in
the
ground
seemed
to
be
united
by
a
membrane
herbert
recognized
in
this
animal
the
capybara
that
is
to
say
one
of
the
largest
members
of
the
rodent
order
meanwhile
the
capybara
did
not
struggle
against
the
dog
it
stupidly
rolled
its
eyes
deeply
buried
in
a
thick
bed
of
fat
perhaps
it
saw
men
for
the
first
time
however
neb
having
tightened
his
grasp
on
his
stick
was
just
going
to
fell
the
pig
when
the
latter
tearing
itself
from
tops
teeth
by
which
it
was
only
held
by
the
tip
of
its
ear
uttered
a
vigorous
grunt
rushed
upon
herbert
almost
overthrew
him
and
disappeared
in
the
wood
the
rascal
cried
pencroft
all
three
directly
darted
after
top
but
at
the
moment
when
they
joined
him
the
animal
had
disappeared
under
the
waters
of
a
large
pond
shaded
by
venerable
pines
neb
herbert
and
pencroft
stopped
motionless
top
plunged
into
the
water
but
the
capybara
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
the
pond
did
not
appear
let
us
wait
said
the
boy
for
he
will
soon
come
to
the
surface
to
breathe
wont
he
drown
asked
neb
no
replied
herbert
since
he
has
webbed
feet
and
is
almost
an
amphibious
animal
but
watch
him
top
remained
in
the
water
pencroft
and
his
two
companions
went
to
different
parts
of
the
bank
so
as
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
capybara
which
the
dog
was
looking
for
beneath
the
water
herbert
was
not
mistaken
in
a
few
minutes
the
animal
appeared
on
the
surface
of
the
water
top
was
upon
it
in
a
bound
and
kept
it
from
plunging
again
an
instant
later
the
capybara
dragged
to
the
bank
was
killed
by
a
blow
from
nebs
stick
hurrah
cried
pencroft
who
was
always
ready
with
this
cry
of
triumph
give
me
but
a
good
fire
and
this
pig
shall
be
gnawed
to
the
bones
pencroft
hoisted
the
capybara
on
his
shoulders
and
judging
by
the
height
of
the
sun
that
it
was
about
two
oclock
he
gave
the
signal
to
return
tops
instinct
was
useful
to
the
hunters
who
thanks
to
the
intelligent
animal
were
enabled
to
discover
the
road
by
which
they
had
come
half
an
hour
later
they
arrived
at
the
river
pencroft
soon
made
a
raft
of
wood
as
he
had
done
before
though
if
there
was
no
fire
it
would
be
a
useless
task
and
the
raft
following
the
current
they
returned
towards
the
chimneys
but
the
sailor
had
not
gone
fifty
paces
when
he
stopped
and
again
uttering
a
tremendous
hurrah
pointed
towards
the
angle
of
the
cliff
herbert
neb
look
he
shouted
smoke
was
escaping
and
curling
up
among
the
rocks
chapter
10
in
a
few
minutes
the
three
hunters
were
before
a
crackling
fire
the
captain
and
the
reporter
were
there
pencroft
looked
from
one
to
the
other
his
capybara
in
his
hand
without
saying
a
word
well
yes
my
brave
fellow
cried
the
reporter
fire
real
fire
which
will
roast
this
splendid
pig
perfectly
and
we
will
have
a
feast
presently
but
who
lighted
it
asked
pencroft
the
sun
gideon
spilett
was
quite
right
in
his
reply
it
was
the
sun
which
had
furnished
the
heat
which
so
astonished
pencroft
the
sailor
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
and
he
was
so
amazed
that
he
did
not
think
of
questioning
the
engineer
had
you
a
burningglass
sir
asked
herbert
of
harding
no
my
boy
replied
he
but
i
made
one
and
he
showed
the
apparatus
which
served
for
a
burningglass
it
was
simply
two
glasses
which
he
had
taken
from
his
own
and
the
reporters
watches
having
filled
them
with
water
and
rendered
their
edges
adhesive
by
means
of
a
little
clay
he
thus
fabricated
a
regular
burningglass
which
concentrating
the
solar
rays
on
some
very
dry
moss
soon
caused
it
to
blaze
the
sailor
considered
the
apparatus
then
he
gazed
at
the
engineer
without
saying
a
word
only
a
look
plainly
expressed
his
opinion
that
if
cyrus
harding
was
not
a
magician
he
was
certainly
no
ordinary
man
at
last
speech
returned
to
him
and
he
cried
note
that
mr
spilett
note
that
down
on
your
paper
it
is
noted
replied
the
reporter
then
neb
helping
him
the
seaman
arranged
the
spit
and
the
capybara
properly
cleaned
was
soon
roasting
like
a
sucklingpig
before
a
clear
crackling
fire
the
chimneys
had
again
become
more
habitable
not
only
because
the
passages
were
warmed
by
the
fire
but
because
the
partitions
of
wood
and
mud
had
been
reestablished
it
was
evident
that
the
engineer
and
his
companions
had
employed
their
day
well
cyrus
harding
had
almost
entirely
recovered
his
strength
and
had
proved
it
by
climbing
to
the
upper
plateau
from
this
point
his
eye
accustomed
to
estimate
heights
and
distances
was
fixed
for
a
long
time
on
the
cone
the
summit
of
which
he
wished
to
reach
the
next
day
the
mountain
situated
about
six
miles
to
the
northwest
appeared
to
him
to
measure
3500
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
consequently
the
gaze
of
an
observer
posted
on
its
summit
would
extend
over
a
radius
of
at
least
fifty
miles
therefore
it
was
probable
that
harding
could
easily
solve
the
question
of
island
or
continent
to
which
he
attached
so
much
importance
they
supped
capitally
the
flesh
of
the
capybara
was
declared
excellent
the
sargassum
and
the
almonds
of
the
stonepine
completed
the
repast
during
which
the
engineer
spoke
little
he
was
preoccupied
with
projects
for
the
next
day
once
or
twice
pencroft
gave
forth
some
ideas
upon
what
it
would
be
best
to
do
but
cyrus
harding
who
was
evidently
of
a
methodical
mind
only
shook
his
head
without
uttering
a
word
tomorrow
he
repeated
we
shall
know
what
we
have
to
depend
upon
and
we
will
act
accordingly
the
meal
ended
fresh
armfuls
of
wood
were
thrown
on
the
fire
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
chimneys
including
the
faithful
top
were
soon
buried
in
a
deep
sleep
no
incident
disturbed
this
peaceful
night
and
the
next
day
the
29th
of
march
fresh
and
active
they
awoke
ready
to
undertake
the
excursion
which
must
determine
their
fate
all
was
ready
for
the
start
the
remains
of
the
capybara
would
be
enough
to
sustain
harding
and
his
companions
for
at
least
twentyfour
hours
besides
they
hoped
to
find
more
food
on
the
way
as
the
glasses
had
been
returned
to
the
watches
of
the
engineer
and
reporter
pencroft
burned
a
little
linen
to
serve
as
tinder
as
to
flint
that
would
not
be
wanting
in
these
regions
of
plutonic
origin
it
was
halfpast
seven
in
the
morning
when
the
explorers
armed
with
sticks
left
the
chimneys
following
pencrofts
advice
it
appeared
best
to
take
the
road
already
traversed
through
the
forest
and
to
return
by
another
route
it
was
also
the
most
direct
way
to
reach
the
mountain
they
turned
the
south
angle
and
followed
the
left
bank
of
the
river
which
was
abandoned
at
the
point
where
it
formed
an
elbow
towards
the
southwest
the
path
already
trodden
under
the
evergreen
trees
was
found
and
at
nine
oclock
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
had
reached
the
western
border
of
the
forest
the
ground
till
then
very
little
undulated
boggy
at
first
dry
and
sandy
afterwards
had
a
gentle
slope
which
ascended
from
the
shore
towards
the
interior
of
the
country
a
few
very
timid
animals
were
seen
under
the
foresttrees
top
quickly
started
them
but
his
master
soon
called
him
back
for
the
time
had
not
come
to
commence
hunting
that
would
be
attended
to
later
the
engineer
was
not
a
man
who
would
allow
himself
to
be
diverted
from
his
fixed
idea
it
might
even
have
been
said
that
he
did
not
observe
the
country
at
all
either
in
its
configuration
or
in
its
natural
productions
his
great
aim
being
to
climb
the
mountain
before
him
and
therefore
straight
towards
it
he
went
at
ten
oclock
a
halt
of
a
few
minutes
was
made
on
leaving
the
forest
the
mountain
system
of
the
country
appeared
before
the
explorers
the
mountain
was
composed
of
two
cones
the
first
truncated
at
a
height
of
about
two
thousand
five
hundred
feet
was
sustained
by
buttresses
which
appeared
to
branch
out
like
the
talons
of
an
immense
claw
set
on
the
ground
between
these
were
narrow
valleys
bristling
with
trees
the
last
clumps
of
which
rose
to
the
top
of
the
lowest
cone
there
appeared
to
be
less
vegetation
on
that
side
of
the
mountain
which
was
exposed
to
the
northeast
and
deep
fissures
could
be
seen
which
no
doubt
were
watercourses
on
the
first
cone
rested
a
second
slightly
rounded
and
placed
a
little
on
one
side
like
a
great
round
hat
cocked
over
the
ear
a
scotchman
would
have
said
his
bonnet
was
a
thocht
ajee
it
appeared
formed
of
bare
earth
here
and
there
pierced
by
reddish
rocks
they
wished
to
reach
the
second
cone
and
proceeding
along
the
ridge
of
the
spurs
seemed
to
be
the
best
way
by
which
to
gain
it
we
are
on
volcanic
ground
cyrus
harding
had
said
and
his
companions
following
him
began
to
ascend
by
degrees
on
the
back
of
a
spur
which
by
a
winding
and
consequently
more
accessible
path
joined
the
first
plateau
the
ground
had
evidently
been
convulsed
by
subterranean
force
here
and
there
stray
blocks
numerous
debris
of
basalt
and
pumicestone
were
met
with
in
isolated
groups
rose
firtrees
which
some
hundred
feet
lower
at
the
bottom
of
the
narrow
gorges
formed
massive
shades
almost
impenetrable
to
the
suns
rays
during
the
first
part
of
the
ascent
herbert
remarked
on
the
footprints
which
indicated
the
recent
passage
of
large
animals
perhaps
these
beasts
will
not
let
us
pass
by
willingly
said
pencroft
well
replied
the
reporter
who
had
already
hunted
the
tiger
in
india
and
the
lion
in
africa
we
shall
soon
learn
how
successfully
to
encounter
them
but
in
the
meantime
we
must
be
upon
our
guard
they
ascended
but
slowly
the
distance
increased
by
detours
and
obstacles
which
could
not
be
surmounted
directly
was
long
sometimes
too
the
ground
suddenly
fell
and
they
found
themselves
on
the
edge
of
a
deep
chasm
which
they
had
to
go
round
thus
in
retracing
their
steps
so
as
to
find
some
practicable
path
much
time
was
employed
and
fatigue
undergone
for
nothing
at
twelve
oclock
when
the
small
band
of
adventurers
halted
for
breakfast
at
the
foot
of
a
large
group
of
firs
near
a
little
stream
which
fell
in
cascades
they
found
themselves
still
half
way
from
the
first
plateau
which
most
probably
they
would
not
reach
till
nightfall
from
this
point
the
view
of
the
sea
was
much
extended
but
on
the
right
the
high
promontory
prevented
their
seeing
whether
there
was
land
beyond
it
on
the
left
the
sight
extended
several
miles
to
the
north
but
on
the
northwest
at
the
point
occupied
by
the
explorers
it
was
cut
short
by
the
ridge
of
a
fantasticallyshaped
spur
which
formed
a
powerful
support
of
the
central
cone
at
one
oclock
the
ascent
was
continued
they
slanted
more
towards
the
southwest
and
again
entered
among
thick
bushes
there
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
fluttered
several
couples
of
gallinaceae
belonging
to
the
pheasant
species
they
were
tragopans
ornamented
by
a
pendant
skin
which
hangs
over
their
throats
and
by
two
small
round
horns
planted
behind
the
eyes
among
these
birds
which
were
about
the
size
of
a
fowl
the
female
was
uniformly
brown
while
the
male
was
gorgeous
in
his
red
plumage
decorated
with
white
spots
gideon
spilett
with
a
stone
cleverly
and
vigorously
thrown
killed
one
of
these
tragopans
on
which
pencroft
made
hungry
by
the
fresh
air
had
cast
greedy
eyes
after
leaving
the
region
of
bushes
the
party
assisted
by
resting
on
each
others
shoulders
climbed
for
about
a
hundred
feet
up
a
steep
acclivity
and
reached
a
level
place
with
very
few
trees
where
the
soil
appeared
volcanic
it
was
necessary
to
ascend
by
zigzags
to
make
the
slope
more
easy
for
it
was
very
steep
and
the
footing
being
exceedingly
precarious
required
the
greatest
caution
neb
and
herbert
took
the
lead
pencroft
the
rear
the
captain
and
the
reporter
between
them
the
animals
which
frequented
these
heightsand
there
were
numerous
traces
of
themmust
necessarily
belong
to
those
races
of
sure
foot
and
supple
spine
chamois
or
goat
several
were
seen
but
this
was
not
the
name
pencroft
gave
them
for
all
of
a
suddensheep
he
shouted
all
stopped
about
fifty
feet
from
halfadozen
animals
of
a
large
size
with
strong
horns
bent
back
and
flattened
towards
the
point
with
a
woolly
fleece
hidden
under
long
silky
hair
of
a
tawny
color
they
were
not
ordinary
sheep
but
a
species
usually
found
in
the
mountainous
regions
of
the
temperate
zone
to
which
herbert
gave
the
name
of
the
musmon
have
they
legs
and
chops
asked
the
sailor
yes
replied
herbert
well
then
they
are
sheep
said
pencroft
the
animals
motionless
among
the
blocks
of
basalt
gazed
with
an
astonished
eye
as
if
they
saw
human
bipeds
for
the
first
time
then
their
fears
suddenly
aroused
they
disappeared
bounding
over
the
rocks
goodbye
till
we
meet
again
cried
pencroft
as
he
watched
them
in
such
a
comical
tone
that
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
herbert
and
neb
could
not
help
laughing
the
ascent
was
continued
here
and
there
were
traces
of
lava
sulphur
springs
sometimes
stopped
their
way
and
they
had
to
go
round
them
in
some
places
the
sulphur
had
formed
crystals
among
other
substances
such
as
whitish
cinders
made
of
an
infinity
of
little
feldspar
crystals
in
approaching
the
first
plateau
formed
by
the
truncating
of
the
lower
cone
the
difficulties
of
the
ascent
were
very
great
towards
four
oclock
the
extreme
zone
of
the
trees
had
been
passed
there
only
remained
here
and
there
a
few
twisted
stunted
pines
which
must
have
had
a
hard
life
in
resisting
at
this
altitude
the
high
winds
from
the
open
sea
happily
for
the
engineer
and
his
companions
the
weather
was
beautiful
the
atmosphere
tranquil
for
a
high
breeze
at
an
elevation
of
three
thousand
feet
would
have
hindered
their
proceedings
the
purity
of
the
sky
at
the
zenith
was
felt
through
the
transparent
air
a
perfect
calm
reigned
around
them
they
could
not
see
the
sun
then
hid
by
the
vast
screen
of
the
upper
cone
which
masked
the
halfhorizon
of
the
west
and
whose
enormous
shadow
stretching
to
the
shore
increased
as
the
radiant
luminary
sank
in
its
diurnal
course
vapormist
rather
than
cloudsbegan
to
appear
in
the
east
and
assume
all
the
prismatic
colors
under
the
influence
of
the
solar
rays
five
hundred
feet
only
separated
the
explorers
from
the
plateau
which
they
wished
to
reach
so
as
to
establish
there
an
encampment
for
the
night
but
these
five
hundred
feet
were
increased
to
more
than
two
miles
by
the
zigzags
which
they
had
to
describe
the
soil
as
it
were
slid
under
their
feet
the
slope
often
presented
such
an
angle
that
they
slipped
when
the
stones
worn
by
the
air
did
not
give
a
sufficient
support
evening
came
on
by
degrees
and
it
was
almost
night
when
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
much
fatigued
by
an
ascent
of
seven
hours
arrived
at
the
plateau
of
the
first
cone
it
was
then
necessary
to
prepare
an
encampment
and
to
restore
their
strength
by
eating
first
and
sleeping
afterwards
this
second
stage
of
the
mountain
rose
on
a
base
of
rocks
among
which
it
would
be
easy
to
find
a
retreat
fuel
was
not
abundant
however
a
fire
could
be
made
by
means
of
the
moss
and
dry
brushwood
which
covered
certain
parts
of
the
plateau
while
the
sailor
was
preparing
his
hearth
with
stones
which
he
put
to
this
use
neb
and
herbert
occupied
themselves
with
getting
a
supply
of
fuel
they
soon
returned
with
a
load
of
brushwood
the
steel
was
struck
the
burnt
linen
caught
the
sparks
of
flint
and
under
nebs
breath
a
crackling
fire
showed
itself
in
a
few
minutes
under
the
shelter
of
the
rocks
their
object
in
lighting
a
fire
was
only
to
enable
them
to
withstand
the
cold
temperature
of
the
night
as
it
was
not
employed
in
cooking
the
bird
which
neb
kept
for
the
next
day
the
remains
of
the
capybara
and
some
dozens
of
the
stonepine
almonds
formed
their
supper
it
was
not
halfpast
six
when
all
was
finished
cyrus
harding
then
thought
of
exploring
in
the
halflight
the
large
circular
layer
which
supported
the
upper
cone
of
the
mountain
before
taking
any
rest
he
wished
to
know
if
it
was
possible
to
get
round
the
base
of
the
cone
in
the
case
of
its
sides
being
too
steep
and
its
summit
being
inaccessible
this
question
preoccupied
him
for
it
was
possible
that
from
the
way
the
hat
inclined
that
is
to
say
towards
the
north
the
plateau
was
not
practicable
also
if
the
summit
of
the
mountain
could
not
be
reached
on
one
side
and
if
on
the
other
they
could
not
get
round
the
base
of
the
cone
it
would
be
impossible
to
survey
the
western
part
of
the
country
and
their
object
in
making
the
ascent
would
in
part
be
altogether
unattained
the
engineer
accordingly
regardless
of
fatigue
leaving
pencroft
and
neb
to
arrange
the
beds
and
gideon
spilett
to
note
the
incidents
of
the
day
began
to
follow
the
edge
of
the
plateau
going
towards
the
north
herbert
accompanied
him
the
night
was
beautiful
and
still
the
darkness
was
not
yet
deep
cyrus
harding
and
the
boy
walked
near
each
other
without
speaking
in
some
places
the
plateau
opened
before
them
and
they
passed
without
hindrance
in
others
obstructed
by
rocks
there
was
only
a
narrow
path
in
which
two
persons
could
not
walk
abreast
after
a
walk
of
twenty
minutes
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
were
obliged
to
stop
from
this
point

the

the

being
inclined
almost
seventy
degrees
the
path
became
impracticable
but
if
the
engineer
and
the
boy
were
obliged
to
give
up
thoughts
of
following
a
circular
direction

an
opportunity
was
given
for
ascending
the

in
fact
before
them
opened
a
deep
hollow
it
was
the
rugged
mouth
of
the
crater
by
which
the
eruptive

matter
had
escaped
at
the
periods

activity

and
crusted

formed
a
sort
of
natural
staircase
of
large
steps

would
greatly
facilitate
the
ascent
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
harding
took
all
this
in
at
a
glance
and
without
hesitating
followed
by
the
lad
he
entered
the
enormous
chasm
in
the
midst
of
an
increasing
obscurity
there
was
still
a
height
of
a
thousand
feet
to
overcome
would
the
interior
acclivities
of
the

practicable
it
would
soon
be
seen
the
persevering
engineer
resolved
to
continue
his
ascent
until
he
was
stopped
happily
these
acclivities
wound
up
the
interior
of
the
volcano
and
favored
their
ascent
as
to
the
volcano
itself
it
could
not
be
doubted
that
it
was
completely
extinct
no
smoke
escaped
from
its
sides
not
a
flame
could
be

in
the
dark
hollows
not
a
roar
not
a

no

even
issued
from
this
black
well
which
perhaps
reached
far
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
the
atmosphere
inside
the

filled
with
no

climbing
up

it
was
nearly

oclock
when
cyrus

set
foot
on
the
highest
ridge
of
the

at
the

of

it
was
then
perfectly
dark
and
their
gaze
could
not
extend
over
a
radius
of
two
miles
did
the

surround
this
unknown
land

was
it
connected
in
the
west
with
some
continent

out
towards
the
west
a
cloudy

the

could
not
discover
if
the

were
blended
together
in
the
same
circular
line
but
at
one
point
of
the
horizon
a
vague
light
suddenly
appeared
which
descended
slowly
in
proportion
as
the
cloud
mounted
to
the
zenith
it
was
the
slender

already
almost
disappearing

its
light
was
sufficient
to
show
clearly
the
horizontal
line
then
detached
from
the
cloud
and
the
engineer
could
see
its
reflection

for
an
instant
on
a
liquid
surface
cyrus

seized
the

in
a
grave
voice
an

at

half
an
hour
later
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
had
returned
to
the
encampment
the
engineer
merely
told
his
companions
that
the
land
upon
which
fate
had
thrown
them
was
an
island
and
that
the
next
day
they
would
consult
then
each
settled
himself
as
well
as
he
could
to
sleep
and
in
that
rocky
hole
at
a
height
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
through
a
peaceful
night
the
islanders
enjoyed
profound
repose
the
next
day
the
30th
of
march
after
a
hasty
breakfast
which
consisted
solely
of
the
roasted
tragopan
the
engineer
wished
to
climb
again
to
the
summit
of
the
volcano
so
as
more
attentively
to
survey
the
island
upon
which
he
and
his
companions
were
imprisoned
for
life
perhaps
should
the
island
be
situated
at
a
great
distance
from
any
land
or
if
it
was
out
of
the
course
of
vessels
which
visited
the
archipelagoes
of
the
pacific
ocean
this
time
his
companions
followed
him
in
the
new
exploration
they
also
wished
to
see
the
island
on
the
productions
of
which
they
must
depend
for
the
supply
of
all
their
wants
it
was
about
seven
oclock
in
the
morning
when
cyrus
harding
herbert
pencroft
gideon
spilett
and
neb
quitted
the
encampment
no
one
appeared
to
be
anxious
about
their
situation
they
had
faith
in
themselves
doubtless
but
it
must
be
observed
that
the
basis
of
this
faith
was
not
the
same
with
harding
as
with
his
companions
the
engineer
had
confidence
because
he
felt
capable
of
extorting
from
this
wild
country
everything
necessary
for
the
life
of
himself
and
his
companions
the
latter
feared
nothing
just
because
cyrus
harding
was
with
them
pencroft
especially
since
the
incident
of
the
relighted
fire
would
not
have
despaired
for
an
instant
even
if
he
was
on
a
bare
rock
if
the

was
with
him
on

left

certainly
no

cyrus
harding
followed
the
same
road
as
the
evening
before
they
went
round
the
cone
by
the
plateau
which
formed
the
shoulder
to
the
mouth
of
the
enormous
chasm
the
weather
was
magnificent
the
sun
rose
in
a
pure
sky
and
flooded
with
his
rays
all
the
eastern
side
of
the
mountain
the
crater
was
reached
it
was
just
what
the
engineer
had
made
it
out
to
be
in
the
dark
that
is
to
say
a
vast
funnel
which
extended
widening
to
a
height
of
a
thousand
feet
above
the
plateau
below
the
chasm
large
thick
streaks
of
lava
wound
over
the
sides
of
the
mountain
and
thus
marked
the
course
of
the
eruptive
matter
to
the
lower
valleys
which
furrowed
the
northern
part
of
the
island
the
interior
of
the
crater
whose
inclination
did
not
exceed
thirty
five
to
forty
degrees
presented
no
difficulties
nor
obstacles
to
the
ascent
traces
of
very
ancient
lava
were
noticed
which
probably
had
overflowed
the
summit
of
the
cone
before
this
lateral
chasm
had
opened
a
new
way
to
it
as
to
the
volcanic
chimney
which
established
a
communication
between
the
subterranean
layers
and
the
crater
its
depth
could
not
be
calculated
with
the
eye
for
it
was
lost
in
obscurity
but
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
complete
extinction
of
the
volcano
before
eight
oclock
harding
and
his
companions
were
assembled
at
the
summit
of
the
crater
on
a
conical
mound
which
swelled
the
northern
edge
the
sea
the
sea
everywhere
they
cried
as
if
their
lips
could
not
restrain
the
words
which
made
islanders
of
them
the
sea
indeed
formed
an
immense
circular
sheet
of
water
all
around
them
perhaps
on
climbing
again
to
the
summit
of
the
cone
cyrus
harding
had
had
a
hope
of
discovering
some
coast
some
island
shore
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
perceive
in
the
dark
the
evening
before
but
nothing
appeared
on
the
farthest
verge
of
the
horizon
that
is
to
say
over
a
radius
of
more
than
fifty
miles
no
land
in
sight
not
a
sail
over
all
this
immense
space
the
ocean
alone
was
visiblethe
island
occupied
the
center
of
a
circumference
which
appeared
to
be
infinite
the
engineer
and
his
companions
mute
and
motionless
surveyed
for
some
minutes
every
point
of
the
ocean
examining
it
to
its
most
extreme
limits
even
pencroft
who
possessed
a
marvelous
power
of
sight
saw
nothing
and
certainly
if
there
had
been
land
at
the
horizon
if
it
appeared
only
as
an
indistinct
vapor
the
sailor
would
undoubtedly
have
found
it
out
for
nature
had
placed
regular
telescopes
under
his
eyebrows
from
the
ocean
their
gaze
returned
to
the
island
which
they
commanded
entirely
and
the
first
question
was
put
by
gideon
spilett
in
these
terms
about
what
size
is
this
island
truly
it
did
not
appear
large
in
the
midst
of
the
immense
ocean
cyrus
harding
reflected
a
few
minutes
he
attentively
observed
the
perimeter
of
the
island
taking
into
consideration
the
height
at
which
he
was
placed
then
my
friends
said
he
i
do
not
think
i
am
mistaken
in
giving
to
the
shore
of
the
island
a
circumference
of
more
than
a
hundred
miles
and
consequently
an
area
that
is
difficult
to
estimate
replied
the
engineer
for
it
is
so
uneven
if
cyrus
harding
was
not
mistaken
in
his
calculation
the
island
had
almost
the
extent
of
malta
or
zante
in
the
mediterranean
but
it
was
at
the
same
time
much
more
irregular
and
less
rich
in
capes
promontories
points
bays
or
creeks
its
strange
form
caught
the
eye
and
when
gideon
spilett
on
the
engineers
advice
had
drawn
the
outline
they
found
that
it
resembled
some
fantastic
animal
a
monstrous
leviathan
which
lay
sleeping
on
the
surface
of
the
pacific
this
was
in
fact
the
exact
shape
of
the
island
which
it
is
of
consequence
to
know
and
a
tolerably
correct
map
of
it
was
immediately
drawn
by
the
reporter
the
east
part
of
the
shore
where
the
castaways
had
landed
formed
a
wide
bay
terminated
by
a
sharp
cape
which
had
been
concealed
by
a
high
point
from
pencroft
on
his
first
exploration
at
the
northeast
two
other
capes
closed
the
bay
and
between
them
ran
a
narrow
gulf
which
looked
like
the
halfopen
jaws
of
a
formidable
dogfish
from
the
northeast
to
the
southwest
the
coast
was
rounded
like
the
flattened
cranium
of
an
animal
rising
again
forming
a
sort
of
protuberance
which
did
not
give
any
particular
shape
to
this
part
of
the
island
of
which
the
center
was
occupied
by
the
volcano
from
this
point
the
shore
ran
pretty
regularly
north
and
south
broken
at
twothirds
of
its
perimeter
by
a
narrow
creek
from
which
it
ended
in
a
long
tail
similar
to
the
caudal
appendage
of
a
gigantic
alligator
this
tail
formed
a
regular
peninsula
which
stretched
more
than
thirty
miles
into
the
sea
reckoning
from
the
cape
southeast
of
the
island
already
mentioned
it
curled
round
making
an
open
roadstead
which
marked
out
the
lower
shore
of
this
strangelyformed
land
at
the
narrowest
part
that
is
to
say
between
the
chimneys
and
the
creek
on
the
western
shore
which
corresponded
to
it
in
latitude
the
island
only
measured
ten
miles
but
its
greatest
length
from
the
jaws
at
the
northeast
to
the
extremity
of
the
tail
of
the
southwest
was
not
less
than
thirty
miles
as
to
the
interior
of
the
island
its
general
aspect
was
this
very
woody
throughout
the
southern
part
from
the
mountain
to
the
shore
and
arid
and
sandy
in
the
northern
part
between
the
volcano
and
the
east
coast
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
were
surprised
to
see
a
lake
bordered
with
green
trees
the
existence
of
which
they
had
not
suspected
seen
from
this
height
the
lake
appeared
to
be
on
the
same
level
as
the
ocean
but
on
reflection
the
engineer
explained
to
his
companions
that
the
altitude
of
this
little
sheet
of
water
must
be
about
three
hundred
feet
because
the
plateau
which
was
its
basin
was
but
a
prolongation
of
the
coast
is
it
a
freshwater
lake
asked
pencroft
certainly
replied
the
engineer
for
it
must
be
fed
by
the
water
which
flows
from
the
mountain
i
see
a
little
river
which
runs
into
it
said
herbert
pointing
out
a
narrow
stream
which
evidently
took
its
source
somewhere
in
the
west
yes
said
harding
and
since
this
stream
feeds
the
lake
most
probably
on
the
side
near
the
sea
there
is
an
outlet
by
which
the
surplus
water
escapes
we
shall
see
that
on
our
return
this
little
winding
watercourse
and
the
river
already
mentioned
constituted
the
watersystem
at
least
such
as
it
was
displayed
to
the
eyes
of
the
explorers
however
it
was
possible
that
under
the
masses
of
trees
which
covered
twothirds
of
the
island
forming
an
immense
forest
other
rivers
ran
towards
the
sea
it
might
even
be
inferred
that
such
was
the
case
so
rich
did
this
region
appear
in
the
most
magnificent
specimens
of
the
flora
of
the
temperate
zones
there
was
no
indication
of
running
water
in
the
north
though
perhaps
there
might
be
stagnant
water
among
the
marshes
in
the
northeast
but
that
was
all
in
addition
to
the
downs
sand
and
aridity
which
contrasted
so
strongly
with
the
luxuriant
vegetation
of
the
rest
of
the
island
the
volcano
did
not
occupy
the
central
part
it
rose
on
the
contrary
in
the
northwestern
region
and
seemed
to
mark
the
boundary
of
the
two
zones
at
the
southwest
at
the
south
and
the
southeast
the
first
part
of
the
spurs
were
hidden
under
masses
of
verdure
at
the
north
on
the
contrary
one
could
follow
their
ramifications
which
died
away
on
the
sandy
plains
it
was
on
this
side
that
at
the
time
when
the
mountain
was
in
a
state
of
eruption
the
discharge
had
worn
away
a
passage
and
a
large
heap
of
lava
had
spread
to
the
narrow
jaw
which
formed
the
northeastern
gulf
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
remained
an
hour
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
the
island
was
displayed
under
their
eyes
like
a
plan
in
relief
with
different
tints
green
for
the
forests
yellow
for
the
sand
blue
for
the
water
they
viewed
it
in
its
toutensemble
nothing
remained
concealed
but
the
ground
hidden
by
verdure
the
hollows
of
the
valleys
and
the
interior
of
the
volcanic
chasms
one
important
question
remained
to
be
solved
and
the
answer
would
have
a
great
effect
upon
the
future
of
the
castaways
was
the
island
inhabited
it
was
the
reporter
who
put
this
question
to
which
after
the
close
examination
they
had
just
made
the
answer
seemed
to
be
in
the
negative
nowhere
could
the
work
of
a
human
hand
be
perceived
not
a
group
of
huts
not
a
solitary
cabin
not
a
fishery
on
the
shore
no
smoke
curling
in
the
air
betrayed
the
presence
of
man
it
is
true
a
distance
of
nearly
thirty
miles
separated
the
observers
from
the
extreme
points
that
is
of
the
tail
which
extended
to
the
southwest
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
even
to
pencrofts
eyes
to
discover
a
habitation
there
neither
could
the
curtain
of
verdure
which
covered
threequarters
of
the
island
be
raised
to
see
if
it
did
not
shelter
some
straggling
village
but
in
general
the
islanders
live
on
the
shores
of
the
narrow
spaces
which
emerge
above
the
waters
of
the
pacific
and
this
shore
appeared
to
be
an
absolute
desert
until
a
more
complete
exploration
it
might
be
admitted
that
the
island
was
uninhabited
but
was
it
frequented
at
least
occasionally
by
the
natives
of
neighboring
islands
it
was
difficult
to
reply
to
this
question
no
land
appeared
within
a
radius
of
fifty
miles
but
fifty
miles
could
be
easily
crossed
either
by
malay
proas
or
by
the
large
polynesian
canoes
everything
depended
on
the
position
of
the
island
of
its
isolation
in
the
pacific
or
of
its
proximity
to
archipelagoes
would
cyrus
harding
be
able
to
find
out
their
latitude
and
longitude
without
instruments
it
would
be
difficult
since
he
was
in
doubt
it
was
best
to
take
precautions
against
a
possible
descent
of
neighboring
natives
the
exploration
of
the
island
was
finished
its
shape
determined
its
features
made
out
its
extent
calculated
the
water
and
mountain
systems
ascertained
the
disposition
of
the
forests
and
plains
had
been
marked
in
a
general
way
on
the
reporters
plan
they
had
now
only
to
descend
the
mountain
slopes
again
and
explore
the
soil
in
the
triple
point
of
view
of
its
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
resources
but
before
giving
his
companions
the
signal
for
departure
cyrus
harding
said
to
them
in
a
calm
grave
voice
here
my
friends
is
the
small
corner
of
land
upon
which
the
hand
of
the
almighty
has
thrown
us
we
are
going
to
live
here
a
long
time
perhaps
perhaps
too
unexpected
help
will
arrive
if
some
ship
passes
by
chance
i
say
by
chance
because
this
is
an
unimportant
island
there
is
not
even
a
port
in
which
ships
could
anchor
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
it
is
situated
out
of
the
route
usually
followed
that
is
to
say
too
much
to
the
south
for
the
ships
which
frequent
the
archipelagoes
of
the
pacific
and
too
much
to
the
north
for
those
which
go
to
australia
by
doubling
cape
horn
i
wish
to
hide
nothing
of
our
position
from
you
and
you
are
right
my
dear
cyrus
replied
the
reporter
with
animation
you
have
to
deal
with
men
they
have
confidence
in
you
and
you
can
depend
upon
them
is
it
not
so
my
friends
i
will
obey
you
in
everything
captain
said
herbert
seizing
the
engineers
hand
my
master
always
and
everywhere
cried
neb
as
for
me
said
the
sailor
if
i
ever
grumble
at
work
my
names
not
jack
pencroft
and
if
you
like
captain
we
will
make
a
little
america
of
this
island
we
will
build
towns
we
will
establish
railways
start
telegraphs
and
one
fine
day
when
it
is
quite
changed
quite
put
in
order
and
quite
civilized
we
will
go
and
offer
it
to
the
government
of
the
union
only
i
ask
one
thing
what
is
that
said
the
reporter
it
is
that
we
do
not
consider
ourselves
castaways
but
colonists
who
have
come
here
to
settle
harding
could
not
help
smiling
and
the
sailors
idea
was
adopted
he
then
thanked
his
companions
and
added
that
he
would
rely
on
their
energy
and
on
the
aid
of
heaven
well
now
let
us
set
off
to
the
chimneys
cried
pencroft
one
minute
my
friends
said
the
engineer
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
give
a
name
to
this
island
as
well
as
to
the
capes
promontories
and
watercourses
which
we
can
see
very
good
said
the
reporter
in
the
future
that
will
simplify
the
instructions
which
we
shall
have
to
give
and
follow
indeed
said
the
sailor
already
it
is
something
to
be
able
to
say
where
one
is
going
and
where
one
has
come
from
at
least
it
looks
like
somewhere
the
chimneys
for
example
said
herbert
exactly
replied
pencroft
that
name
was
the
most
convenient
and
it
came
to
me
quite
of
myself
shall
we
keep
the
name
of
the
chimneys
for
our
first
encampment
captain
yes
pencroft
since
you
have
so
christened
it
good
as
for
the
others
that
will
be
easy
returned
the
sailor
who
was
in
high
spirits
let
us
give
them
names
as
the
robinsons
did
whose
story
herbert
has
often
read
to
me
providence
bay
whale
point
cape
disappointment
or
rather
the
names
of
captain
harding
said
herbert
of
mr
spilett
of
neb
my
name
cried
neb
showing
his
sparkling
white
teeth
why
not
replied
pencroft
port
neb
that
would
do
very
well
and
cape
gideon
i
should
prefer
borrowing
names
from
our
country
said
the
reporter
which
would
remind
us
of
america
yes
for
the
principal
ones
then
said
cyrus
harding
for
those
of
the
bays
and
seas
i
admit
it
willingly
we
might
give
to
that
vast
bay
on
the
east
the
name
of
union
bay
for
example
to
that
large
hollow
on
the
south
washington
bay
to
the
mountain
upon
which
we
are
standing
that
of
mount
franklin
to
that
lake
which
is
extended
under
our
eyes
that
of
lake
grant
nothing
could
be
better
my
friends
these
names
will
recall
our
country
and
those
of
the
great
citizens
who
have
honored
it
but
for
the
rivers
gulfs
capes
and
promontories
which
we
perceive
from
the
top
of
this
mountain
rather
let
us
choose
names
which
will
recall
their
particular
shape
they
will
impress
themselves
better
on
our
memory
and
at
the
same
time
will
be
more
practical
the
shape
of
the
island
is
so
strange
that
we
shall
not
be
troubled
to
imagine
what
it
resembles
as
to
the
streams
which
we
do
not
know
as
yet
in
different
parts
of
the
forest
which
we
shall
explore
later
the
creeks
which
afterwards
will
be
discovered
we
can
christen
them
as
we
find
them
what
do
you
think
my
friends
the
engineers
proposal
was
unanimously
agreed
to
by
his
companions
the
island
was
spread
out
under
their
eyes
like
a
map
and
they
had
only
to
give
names
to
all
its
angles
and
points
gideon
spilett
would
write
them
down
and
the
geographical
nomenclature
of
the
island
would
be
definitely
adopted
first
they
named
the
two
bays
and
the
mountain
union
bay
washington
bay
and
mount
franklin
as
the
engineer
had
suggested
now
said
the
reporter
to
this
peninsula
at
the
southwest
of
the
island
i
propose
to
give
the
name
of
serpentine
peninsula
and
that
of
reptileend
to
the
bent
tail
which
terminates
it
for
it
is
just
like
a
reptiles
tail
adopted
said
the
engineer
now
said
herbert
pointing
to
the
other
extremity
of
the
island
let
us
call
this
gulf
which
is
so
singularly
like
a
pair
of
open
jaws
shark
gulf
capital
cried
pencroft
and
we
can
complete
the
resemblance
by
naming
the
two
parts
of
the
jaws
mandible
cape
but
there
are
two
capes
observed
the
reporter
well
replied
pencroft
we
can
have
north
mandible
cape
and
south
mandible
cape
they
are
inscribed
said
spilett
there
is
only
the
point
at
the
southeastern
extremity
of
the
island
to
be
named
said
pencroft
that
is
the
extremity
of
union
bay
asked
herbert
claw
cape
cried
neb
directly
who
also
wished
to
be
godfather
to
some
part
of
his
domain
in
truth
neb
had
found
an
excellent
name
for
this
cape
was
very
like
the
powerful
claw
of
the
fantastic
animal
which
this
singularlyshaped
island
represented
pencroft
was
delighted
at
the
turn
things
had
taken
and
their
imaginations
soon
gave
to
the
river
which
furnished
the
settlers
with
drinking
water
and
near
which
the
balloon
had
thrown
them
the
name
of
the
mercy
in
true
gratitude
to
providence
to
the
islet
upon
which
the
castaways
had
first
landed
the
name
of
safety
island
to
the
plateau
which
crowned
the
high
granite
precipice
above
the
chimneys
and
from
whence
the
gaze
could
embrace
the
whole
of
the
vast
bay
the
name
of
prospect
heights
lastly
all
the
masses
of
impenetrable
wood
which
covered
the
serpentine
peninsula
were
named
the
forests
of
the
far
west
the
nomenclature
of
the
visible
and
known
parts
of
the
island
was
thus
finished
and
later
they
would
complete
it
as
they
made
fresh
discoveries
as
to
the
points
of
the
compass
the
engineer
had
roughly
fixed
them
by
the
height
and
position
of
the
sun
which
placed
union
bay
and
prospect
heights
to
the
east
but
the
next
day
by
taking
the
exact
hour
of
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
and
by
marking
its
position
between
this
rising
and
setting
he
reckoned
to
fix
the
north
of
the
island
exactly
for
in
consequence
of
its
situation
in
the
southern
hemisphere
the
sun
at
the
precise
moment
of
its
culmination
passed
in
the
north
and
not
in
the
south
as
in
its
apparent
movement
it
seems
to
do
to
those
places
situated
in
the
northern
hemisphere
everything
was
finished
and
the
settlers
had
only
to
descend
mount
franklin
to
return
to
the
chimneys
when
pencroft
cried
out
well
we
are
preciously
stupid
why
asked
gideon
spilett
who
had
closed
his
notebook
and
risen
to
depart
why
our
island
we
have
forgotten
to
christen
it
herbert
was
going
to
propose
to
give
it
the
engineers
name
and
all
his
companions
would
have
applauded
him
when
cyrus
harding
said
simply
let
us
give
it
the
name
of
a
great
citizen
my
friend
of
him
who
now
struggles
to
defend
the
unity
of
the
american
republic
let
us
call
it
lincoln
island
the
engineers
proposal
was
replied
to
by
three
hurrahs
and
that
evening
before
sleeping
the
new
colonists
talked
of
their
absent
country
they
spoke
of
the
terrible
war
which
stained
it
with
blood
they
could
not
doubt
that
the
south
would
soon
be
subdued
and
that
the
cause
of
the
north
the
cause
of
justice
would
triumph
thanks
to
grant
thanks
to
lincoln
now
this
happened
the
30th
of
march
1865
they
little
knew
that
sixteen
days
afterwards
a
frightful
crime
would
be
committed
in
washington
and
that
on
good
friday
abraham
lincoln
would
fall
by
the
hand
of
a
fanatic
chapter
12
they
now
began
the
descent
of
the
mountain
climbing
down
the
crater
they
went
round
the
cone
and
reached
their
encampment
of
the
previous
night
pencroft
thought
it
must
be
breakfasttime
and
the
watches
of
the
reporter
and
engineer
were
therefore
consulted
to
find
out
the
hour
that
of
gideon
spilett
had
been
preserved
from
the
seawater
as
he
had
been
thrown
at
once
on
the
sand
out
of
reach
of
the
waves
it
was
an
instrument
of
excellent
quality
a
perfect
pocket
chronometer
which
the
reporter
had
not
forgotten
to
wind
up
carefully
every
day
as
to
the
engineers
watch
it
of
course
had
stopped
during
the
time
which
he
had
passed
on
the
downs
the
engineer
now
wound
it
up
and
ascertaining
by
the
height
of
the
sun
that
it
must
be
about
nine
oclock
in
the
morning
he
put
his
watch
at
that
hour
no
my
dear
spilett
wait
you
have
kept
the
richmond
time
have
you
not
yes
cyrus
consequently
your
watch
is
set
by
the
meridian
of
that
town
which
is
almost
that
of
washington
undoubtedly
very
well
keep
it
thus
content
yourself
with
winding
it
up
very
exactly
but
do
not
touch
the
hands
this
may
be
of
use
to
us
what
will
be
the
good
of
that
thought
the
sailor
they
ate
and
so
heartily
that
the
store
of
game
and
almonds
was
totally
exhausted
but
pencroft
was
not
at
all
uneasy
they
would
supply
themselves
on
the
way
top
whose
share
had
been
very
much
to
his
taste
would
know
how
to
find
some
fresh
game
among
the
brushwood
moreover
the
sailor
thought
of
simply
asking
the
engineer
to
manufacture
some
powder
and
one
or
two
fowlingpieces
he
supposed
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
that
on
leaving
the
plateau
the
captain
proposed
to
his
companions
to
return
to
the
chimneys
by
a
new
way
he
wished
to
reconnoiter
lake
grant
so
magnificently
framed
in
trees
they
therefore
followed
the
crest
of
one
of
the
spurs
between
which
the
creek
that
supplied
the
lake
probably
had
its
source
in
talking
the
settlers
already
employed
the
names
which
they
had
just
chosen
which
singularly
facilitated
the
exchange
of
their
ideas
herbert
and
pencroftthe
one
young
and
the
other
very
boyishwere
enchanted
and
while
walking
the
sailor
said
hey
herbert
how
capital
it
sounds
it
will
be
impossible
to
lose
ourselves
my
boy
since
whether
we
follow
the
way
to
lake
grant
or
whether
we
join
the
mercy
through
the
woods
of
the
far
west
we
shall
be
certain
to
arrive
at
prospect
heights
and
consequently
at
union
bay
it
had
been
agreed
that
without
forming
a
compact
band
the
settlers
should
not
stray
away
from
each
other
it
was
very
certain
that
the
thick
forests
of
the
island
were
inhabited
by
dangerous
animals
and
it
was
prudent
to
be
on
their
guard
in
general
pencroft
herbert
and
neb
walked
first
preceded
by
top
who
poked
his
nose
into
every
bush
the
reporter
and
the
engineer
went
together
gideon
spilett
ready
to
note
every
incident
the
engineer
silent
for
the
most
part
and
only
stepping
aside
to
pick
up
one
thing
or
another
a
mineral
or
vegetable
substance
which
he
put
into
his
pocket
without
making
any
remark
what
can
he
be
picking
up
muttered
pencroft
i
have
looked
in
vain
for
anything
thats
worth
the
trouble
of
stooping
for
towards
ten
oclock
the
little
band
descended
the
last
declivities
of
mount
franklin
as
yet
the
ground
was
scantily
strewn
with
bushes
and
trees
they
were
walking
over
yellowish
calcinated
earth
forming
a
plain
of
nearly
a
mile
long
which
extended
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
great
blocks
of
that
basalt
which
according
to
bischof
takes
three
hundred
and
fifty
millions
of
years
to
cool
strewed
the
plain
very
confused
in
some
places
however
there
were
here
no
traces
of
lava
which
was
spread
more
particularly
over
the
northern
slopes
cyrus
harding
expected
to
reach
without
incident
the
course
of
the
creek
which
he
supposed
flowed
under
the
trees
at
the
border
of
the
plain
when
he
saw
herbert
running
hastily
back
while
neb
and
the
sailor
were
hiding
behind
the
rocks
whats
the
matter
my
boy
asked
spilett
smoke
replied
herbert
we
have
seen
smoke
among
the
rocks
a
hundred
paces
from
us
men
in
this
place
cried
the
reporter
we
must
avoid
showing
ourselves
before
knowing
with
whom
we
have
to
deal
replied
cyrus
harding
i
trust
that
there
are
no
natives
on
this
island
i
dread
them
more
than
anything
else
where
is
top
top
is
on
before
and
he
doesnt
bark
no
that
is
strange
however
we
must
try
to
call
him
back
in
a
few
moments
the
engineer
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
had
rejoined
their
two
companions
and
like
them
they
kept
out
of
sight
behind
the
heaps
of
basalt
from
thence
they
clearly
saw
smoke
of
a
yellowish
color
rising
in
the
air
top
was
recalled
by
a
slight
whistle
from
his
master
and
the
latter
signing
to
his
companions
to
wait
for
him
glided
away
among
the
rocks
the
colonists
motionless
anxiously
awaited
the
result
of
this
exploration
when
a
shout
from
the
engineer
made
them
hasten
forward
they
soon
joined
him
and
were
at
once
struck
with
a
disagreeable
odor
which
impregnated
the
atmosphere
the
odor
easily
recognized
was
enough
for
the
engineer
to
guess
what
the
smoke
was
which
at
first
not
without
cause
had
startled
him
this
fire
said
he
or
rather
this
smoke
is
produced
by
nature
alone
there
is
a
sulphur
spring
there
which
will
cure
all
our
sore
throats
captain
cried
pencroft
what
a
pity
that
i
havent
got
a
cold
the
settlers
then
directed
their
steps
towards
the
place
from
which
the
smoke
escaped
they
there
saw
a
sulphur
spring
which
flowed
abundantly
between
the
rocks
and
its
waters
discharged
a
strong
sulphuric
acid
odor
after
having
absorbed
the
oxygen
of
the
air
cyrus
harding
dipping
in
his
hand
felt
the
water
oily
to
the
touch
he
tasted
it
and
found
it
rather
sweet
as
to
its
temperature
that
he
estimated
at
ninetyfive
degrees
fahrenheit
herbert
having
asked
on
what
he
based
this
calculation
its
quite
simple
my
boy
said
he
for
in
plunging
my
hand
into
the
water
i
felt
no
sensation
either
of
heat
or
cold
therefore
it
has
the
same
temperature
as
the
human
body
which
is
about
ninetyfive
degrees
the
sulphur
spring
not
being
of
any
actual
use
to
the
settlers
they
proceeded
towards
the
thick
border
of
the
forest
which
began
some
hundred
paces
off
there
as
they
had
conjectured
the
waters
of
the
stream
flowed
clear
and
limpid
between
high
banks
of
red
earth
the
color
of
which
betrayed
the
presence
of
oxide
of
iron
from
this
color
the
name
of
red
creek
was
immediately
given
to
the
watercourse
it
was
only
a
large
stream
deep
and
clear
formed
of
the
mountain
water
which
half
river
half
torrent
here
rippling
peacefully
over
the
sand
there
falling
against
the
rocks
or
dashing
down
in
a
cascade
ran
towards
the
lake
over
a
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
its
breadth
varying
from
thirty
to
forty
feet
its
waters
were
sweet
and
it
was
supposed
that
those
of
the
lake
were
so
also
a
fortunate
circumstance
in
the
event
of
their
finding
on
its
borders
a
more
suitable
dwelling
than
the
chimneys
as
to
the
trees
which
some
hundred
feet
downwards
shaded
the
banks
of
the
creek
they
belonged
for
the
most
part
to
the
species
which
abound
in
the
temperate
zone
of
america
and
tasmania
and
no
longer
to
those
coniferae
observed
in
that
portion
of
the
island
already
explored
to
some
miles
from
prospect
heights
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
commencement
of
the
month
of
april
which
represents
the
month
of
october
in
this
hemisphere
that
is
the
beginning
of
autumn
they
were
still
in
full
leaf
they
consisted
principally
of
casuarinas
and
eucalypti
some
of
which
next
year
would
yield
a
sweet
manna
similar
to
the
manna
of
the
east
clumps
of
australian
cedars
rose
on
the
sloping
banks
which
were
also
covered
with
the
high
grass
called
tussac
in
new
holland
but
the
cocoanut
so
abundant
in
the
archipelagoes
of
the
pacific
seemed
to
be
wanting
in
the
island
the
latitude
doubtless
being
too
low
what
a
pity
said
herbert
such
a
useful
tree
and
which
has
such
beautiful
nuts
as
to
the
birds
they
swarmed
among
the
scanty
branches
of
the
eucalypti
and
casuarinas
which
did
not
hinder
the
display
of
their
wings
black
white
or
gray
cockatoos
paroquets
with
plumage
of
all
colors
kingfishers
of
a
sparkling
green
and
crowned
with
red
blue
lories
and
various
other
birds
appeared
on
all
sides
as
through
a
prism
fluttering
about
and
producing
a
deafening
clamor
suddenly
a
strange
concert
of
discordant
voices
resounded
in
the
midst
of
a
thicket
the
settlers
heard
successively
the
song
of
birds
the
cry
of
quadrupeds
and
a
sort
of
clacking
which
they
might
have
believed
to
have
escaped
from
the
lips
of
a
native
neb
and
herbert
rushed
towards
the
bush
forgetting
even
the
most
elementary
principles
of
prudence
happily
they
found
there
neither
a
formidable
wild
beast
nor
a
dangerous
native
but
merely
half
a
dozen
mocking
and
singing
birds
known
as
mountain
pheasants
a
few
skillful
blows
from
a
stick
soon
put
an
end
to
their
concert
and
procured
excellent
food
for
the
evenings
dinner
herbert
also
discovered
some
magnificent
pigeons
with
bronzed
wings
some
superbly
crested
others
draped
in
green
like
their
congeners
at
portmacquarie
but
it
was
impossible
to
reach
them
or
the
crows
and
magpies
which
flew
away
in
flocks
a
charge
of
small
shot
would
have
made
great
slaughter
among
these
birds
but
the
hunters
were
still
limited
to
sticks
and
stones
and
these
primitive
weapons
proved
very
insufficient
their
insufficiency
was
still
more
clearly
shown
when
a
troop
of
quadrupeds
jumping
bounding
making
leaps
of
thirty
feet
regular
flying
mammiferae
fled
over
the
thickets
so
quickly
and
at
such
a
height
that
one
would
have
thought
that
they
passed
from
one
tree
to
another
like
squirrels
kangaroos
cried
herbert
are
they
good
to
eat
asked
pencroft
stewed
replied
the
reporter
their
flesh
is
equal
to
the
best
venison
gideon
spilett
had
not
finished
this
exciting
sentence
when
the
sailor
followed
by
neb
and
herbert
darted
on
the
kangaroos
tracks
cyrus
harding
called
them
back
in
vain
but
it
was
in
vain
too
for
the
hunters
to
pursue
such
agile
game
which
went
bounding
away
like
balls
after
a
chase
of
five
minutes
they
lost
their
breath
and
at
the
same
time
all
sight
of
the
creatures
which
disappeared
in
the
wood
top
was
not
more
successful
than
his
masters
captain
said
pencroft
when
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
had
rejoined
them
captain
you
see
quite
well
we
cant
get
on
unless
we
make
a
few
guns
will
that
be
possible
perhaps
replied
the
engineer
but
we
will
begin
by
first
manufacturing
some
bows
and
arrows
and
i
dont
doubt
that
you
will
become
as
clever
in
the
use
of
them
as
the

replied
the

bows
and
arrows
were
sufficient
for
centuries
to
stain
the
earth
with
blood
powder

but
a
thing
of

is

thats
true
mr
spilett
replied
the
sailor
and
i
always
speak
too
quickly
you
must
excuse
me
meanwhile
herbert
constant
to
his
favorite
science
natural
history
reverted
to
the
kangaroos
saying
besides
we
had
to
deal
just
now
with
the
species
which
is
most
difficult
to
catch
they
were
giants
with
long
gray
fur
but
if
i
am
not
mistaken
there
exist
black
and
red
kangaroos
rock
kangaroos
and
rat
kangaroos
which
are
more
easy
to
get
hold
of
it
is
reckoned
that
there
are
about
a
dozen
species
herbert
replied
the
sailor
sententiously
there
is
only
one
species
of
kangaroos
to
me
that
is
kangaroo
on
the
spit
and
its
just
the
one
we
havent
got
this
evening
they
could
not
help
laughing
at
master
pencrofts
new
classification
the
honest
sailor
did
not
hide
his
regret
at
being
reduced
for
dinner
to
the
singing
pheasants
but
fortune
once
more
showed
itself
obliging
to
him
in
fact
top
who
felt
that
his
interest
was
concerned
went
and
ferreted
everywhere
with
an
instinct
doubled
by
a
ferocious
appetite
it
was
even
probable
that
if
some
piece
of
game
did
fall
into
his
clutches
none
would
be
left
for
the
hunters
if
top
was
hunting
on
his
own
account
but
neb
watched
him
and
he
did
well
towards
three
oclock
the
dog
disappeared
in
the
brushwood
and
gruntings
showed
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
some
animal
neb
rushed
after
him
and
soon
saw
top
eagerly
devouring
a
quadruped
which
ten
seconds
later
would
have
been
past
recognizing
in
tops
stomach
but
fortunately
the
dog
had
fallen
upon
a
brood
and
besides
the
victim
he
was
devouring
two
other
rodentsthe

strangled
on
the
turf
neb
reappeared
triumphantly
holding
one
of
the
rodents
in
each
hand
their
size
exceeded
that
of
a
rabbit
their
hair
was
yellow
mingled
with
green
spots
and
they
had
the
merest
rudiments
of
tails
the
citizens
of
the
union
were
at
no
loss
for
the
right
name
of
these
rodents
they
were
maras
a
sort
of
agouti
a
little
larger

their
congeners
of

pencroft
the

arrived
and
now
we
can

the

interrupted
for
an
instant
was
resumed
the
limpid

bent
over
the
stream
which
could
be
heard
murmuring
beneath
the
bowers
of
verdure
meanwhile
the
stream
grew
much
wider
and
cyrus
harding
supposed
that
they
would
soon
reach
its
mouth
in
fact
on
emerging
from
beneath
a
thick
clump
of
beautiful
trees
it
suddenly
appeared
before
their
eyes
the
explorers
had
arrived
on
the
western
shore
of
lake
grant
the
place
was
well
worth
looking
at
this
extent
of
water
of
a
circumference
of
nearly
seven
miles
and
an
area
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
acres
reposed
in
a
border
of
diversified
trees
towards
the
east
through
a
curtain
of
verdure
picturesquely
raised
in
some
places
sparkled
an
horizon
of
sea
the
lake
was
curved
at
the
north
which
contrasted
with
the
sharp
outline
of
its
lower
part
numerous
aquatic
birds
frequented
the
shores
of
this
little
ontario
in
which
the
thousand
isles
of
its
american
namesake
were
represented
by
a
rock
which
emerged
from
its
surface
some
hundred
feet
from
the
southern
shore
there
lived
in
harmony
several
couples
of
kingfishers
perched
on
a
stone
grave
motionless
watching
for
fish
then
darting
down
they
plunged
in
with
a
sharp
cry
and
reappeared
with
their
prey
in
their
beaks
on
the
shores
and
on
the
islets
strutted
wild
ducks
pelicans
waterhens
redbeaks
philedons
furnished
with
a
tongue
like
a
brush
and
one
or
two
specimens
of
the
splendid
menura
the
tail
of
which
expands
gracefully
like
a
lyre
as
to
the
water
of
the
lake
it
was
sweet
limpid
rather
dark
and
from
certain
bubblings
and
the
concentric
circles
which
crossed
each
other
on
the
surface
it
could
not
be
doubted
that
it
abounded
in
fish
this
lake
is
really
beautiful
said
gideon
spilett
we
could
live
on
its
borders
we
will
live
there
replied
harding
the
settlers
wishing
to
return
to
the
chimneys
by
the
shortest
way
descended
towards
the
angle
formed
on
the
south
by
the
junction
of
the
lakes
bank
it
was
not
without
difficulty
that
they
broke
a
path
through
the
thickets
and
brushwood
which
had
never
been
put
aside
by
the
hand
of
men
and
they
thus
went
towards
the
shore
so
as
to
arrive
at
the
north
of
prospect
heights
two
miles
were
cleared
in
this
direction
and
then
after
they
had
passed
the
last
curtain
of
trees
appeared
the
plateau
carpeted
with
thick
turf
and
beyond
that
the
infinite
sea
to
return
to
the
chimneys
it
was
enough
to
cross
the
plateau
obliquely
for
the
space
of
a
mile
and
then
to
descend
to
the
elbow
formed
by
the
first
detour
of
the
mercy
but
the
engineer
desired
to
know
how
and
where
the
overplus
of
the
water
from
the
lake
escaped
and
the
exploration
was
prolonged
under
the
trees
for
a
mile
and
a
half
towards
the
north
it
was
most
probable
that
an
overfall
existed
somewhere
and
doubtless
through
a
cleft
in
the
granite
this
lake
was
only
in
short
an
immense
center
basin
which
was
filled
by
degrees
by
the
creek
and
its
waters
must
necessarily
pass
to
the
sea
by
some
fall
if
it
was
so
the
engineer
thought
that
it
might
perhaps
be
possible
to
utilize
this
fall
and
borrow
its
power
actually
lost
without
profit
to
any
one
they
continued
then
to
follow
the
shores
of
lake
grant
by
climbing
the
plateau
but
after
having
gone
a
mile
in
this
direction
cyrus
harding
had
not
been
able
to
discover
the
overfall
which
however
must
exist
somewhere
it
was
then
halfpast
four
in
order
to
prepare
for
dinner
it
was
necessary
that
the
settlers
should
return
to
their
dwelling
the
little
band
retraced
their
steps
therefore
and
by
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
arrived
at
the
chimneys
the
fire
was
lighted
and
neb
and
pencroft
on
whom
the
functions
of
cooks
naturally
devolved
to
the
one
in
his
quality
of
negro
to
the
other
in
that
of
sailor
quickly
prepared
some
broiled
agouti
to
which
they
did
great
justice
the
repast
at
length
terminated
at
the
moment
when
each
one
was
about
to
give
himself
up
to
sleep
cyrus
harding
drew
from
his
pocket
little
specimens
of
different
sorts
of
minerals
and
just
said
my
friends
this
is
iron

this

us
these

them

well
captain
where
are
we
going
to
begin
asked
pencroft
next
morning
of
the
engineer
at
the
beginning
replied
cyrus
harding
and
in
fact
the
settlers
were
compelled
to
begin
at
the
very
beginning
they
did
not
possess
even
the
tools
necessary
for
making
tools
and
they
were
not
even
in
the
condition
of
nature
who
having
time
husbands
her
strength
they
had
no
time
since
they
had
to
provide
for
the
immediate
wants
of
their
existence
and
though
profiting
by
acquired
experience
they
had
nothing
to
invent
still
they
had
everything
to
make
their
iron
and
their
steel
were
as
yet
only
in
the
state
of
minerals
their
earthenware
in
the
state
of
clay
their
linen
and
their
clothes
in
the
state
of
textile
material
it
must
be
said
however
that
the
settlers
were
men
in
the
complete
and
higher
sense
of
the
word
the
engineer
harding
could
not
have
been
seconded
by
more
intelligent
companions
nor
with
more
devotion
and
zeal
he
had
tried
them
he
knew
their
abilities
gideon

a
talented
reporter
having
learned
everything
so
as
to
be
able
to

of
everything
would
contribute
largely
with
his
head
and
hands
to
the
colonization
of
the
island
he
would
not
draw
back
from
any
task
a
determined
sportsman
he
would
make
a
business
of
what
till
then
had
only
been
a
pleasure
to
him
herbert
a
gallant
boy
already
remarkably
well
informed
in
the
natural
sciences
would
render

to
the
common
cause
neb
was

personified
clever
intelligent
indefatigable
robust
with
iron
health
he
knew
a
little
about
the
work
of
the
forge
and
could
not
fail
to
be
very
useful
in
the

as

and
like
all

fit

he
knew
how
to

everything
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
unite
five
men
better
fitted
to

against
fate
more
certain
to
triumph
over
it
at
the
beginning
cyrus
harding
had
said
now
this
beginning
of
which
the
engineer
spoke
was
the
construction
of
an
apparatus
which
would
serve
to
transform
the
natural
substances
the
part
which
heat
plays
in
these
transformations
is
known
now
fuel
wood
or
coal
was
ready
for
immediate
use
an
oven
must
be
built
to
use
it
what
is
this
oven
for
asked
pencroft
to
make
the
pottery
which
we
have
need
of
replied
harding
and
of
what
shall
we
make
the
oven
with
bricks
and
the
bricks
with
clay
let
us
start
my
friends
to
save
trouble
we
will
establish
our
manufactory
at
the
place
of
production
neb
will
bring
provisions
and
there
will
be
no
lack
of
fire
to
cook
the
food
no
replied
the
reporter
but
if
there
is
a
lack
of
food
for
want
of
instruments
for
the
chase
ah
if
we
only
had
a
knife
cried
the
sailor
well
asked
cyrus
harding
well
i
would
soon
make
a
bow
and
arrows
and
then
there
could
be
plenty
of
game
in
the
larder
yes
a
knife
a
sharp
blade
said
the
engineer
as
if
he
was
speaking
to
himself
at
this
moment
his
eyes
fell
upon
top
who
was
running
about
on
the
shore
suddenly
hardings
face
became
animated
top
here
said
he
the
dog
came
at
his
masters
call
the
latter
took
tops
head
between
his
hands
and
unfastening
the
collar
which
the
animal
wore
round
his
neck
he
broke
it
in
two
saying
there
are
two
knives
pencroft
two
hurrahs
from
the
sailor
was
the
reply
tops
collar
was
made
of
a
thin
piece
of
tempered
steel
they
had
only
to
sharpen
it
on
a
piece
of
sandstone
then
to
raise
the
edge
on
a
finer
stone
now
sandstone
was
abundant
on
the
beach
and
two
hours
after
the
stock
of
tools
in
the
colony
consisted
of
two
sharp
blades
which
were
easily
fixed
in
solid
handles
the
production
of
these
their
first
tools
was
hailed
as
a
triumph
it
was
indeed
a
valuable
result
of
their
labor
and
a
very
opportune
one
they
set
out
cyrus
harding
proposed
that
they
should
return
to
the
western
shore
of
the
lake
where
the
day
before
he
had
noticed
the
clayey
ground
of
which
he
possessed
a
specimen
they
therefore
followed
the
bank
of
the
mercy
traversed
prospect
heights
and
after
a
walk
of
five
miles
or
more
they
reached
a
glade
situated
two
hundred
feet
from
lake
grant
on
the
way
herbert
had
discovered
a
tree
the
branches
of
which
the
indians
of
south
america
employ
for
making
their
bows
it
was
the
crejimba
of
the
palm
family
which
does
not
bear
edible
fruit
long
straight
branches
were
cut
the
leaves
stripped
off
it
was
shaped
stronger
in
the
middle
more
slender
at
the
extremities
and
nothing
remained
to
be
done
but
to
find
a
plant
fit
to
make
the
bowstring
this
was
the
hibiscus
heterophyllus
which
furnishes
fibers
of
such
remarkable
tenacity
that
they
have
been
compared
to
the
tendons
of
animals
pencroft
thus
obtained
bows
of
tolerable
strength
for
which
he
only
wanted
arrows
these
were
easily
made
with
straight
stiff
branches
without
knots
but
the
points
with
which
they
must
be
armed
that
is
to
say
a
substance
to
serve
in
lieu
of
iron
could
not
be
met
with
so
easily
but
pencroft
said
that
having
done
his
part
of
the
work
chance
would
do
the
rest
the
settlers
arrived
on
the
ground
which
had
been
discovered
the
day
before
being
composed
of
the
sort
of
clay
which
is
used
for
making
bricks
and
tiles
it
was
very
useful
for
the
work
in
question
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
it
it
was
enough
to
scour
the
clay
with
sand
then
to
mold
the
bricks
and
bake
them
by
the
heat
of
a
wood
fire
generally
bricks
are
formed
in
molds
but
the
engineer
contented
himself
with
making
them
by
hand
all
that
day
and
the
day
following
were
employed
in
this
work
the
clay
soaked
in
water
was
mixed
by
the
feet
and
hands
of
the
manipulators
and
then
divided
into
pieces
of
equal
size
a
practiced
workman
can
make
without
a
machine
about
ten
thousand
bricks
in
twelve
hours
but
in
their
two
days
work
the
five
brickmakers
on
lincoln
island
had
not
made
more
than
three
thousand
which
were
ranged
near
each
other
until
the
time
when
their
complete
desiccation
would
permit
them
to
be
used
in
building
the
oven
that
is
to
say
in
three
or
four
days
it
was
on
the
2nd
of
april
that
harding
had
employed
himself
in
fixing
the
orientation
of
the
island
or
in
other
words
the
precise
spot
where
the
sun
rose
the
day
before
he
had
noted
exactly
the
hour
when
the
sun
disappeared
beneath
the
horizon
making
allowance
for
the
refraction
this
morning
he
noted
no
less
exactly
the
hour
at
which
it
reappeared
between
this
setting
and
rising
twelve
hours
twentyfour
minutes
passed
then
six
hours
twelve
minutes
after
its
rising
the
sun
on
this
day
would
exactly
pass
the
meridian
and
the
point
of
the
sky
which
it
occupied
at
this
moment
would
be
the
north
at
the
said
hour
cyrus
marked
this
point
and
putting
in
a
line
with
the
sun
two
trees
which
would
serve
him
for
marks
he
thus
obtained
an
invariable
meridian
for
his
ulterior
operations
the
settlers
employed
the
two
days
before
the
oven
was
built
in
collecting
fuel
branches
were
cut
all
round
the
glade
and
they
picked
up
all
the
fallen
wood
under
the
trees
they
were
also
able
to
hunt
with
greater
success
since
pencroft
now
possessed
some
dozen
arrows
armed
with
sharp
points
it
was
top
who
had
furnished
these
points
by
bringing
in
a
porcupine
rather
inferior
eating
but
of
great
value
thanks
to
the
quills
with
which
it
bristled
these
quills
were
fixed
firmly
at
the
ends
of
the
arrows
the
flight
of
which
was
made
more
certain
by
some
cockatoos
feathers
the
reporter
and
herbert
soon
became
very
skilful
archers
game
of
all
sorts
in
consequence
abounded
at
the
chimneys
capybaras
pigeons
agouties
grouse
etc
the
greater
part
of
these
animals
were
killed
in
the
part
of
the
forest
on
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
jacamar
wood
in
remembrance
of
the
bird
which
pencroft
and
herbert
had
pursued
when
on
their
first
exploration
this
game
was
eaten
fresh
but
they
preserved
some
capybara
hams
by
smoking
them
above
a
fire
of
green
wood
after
having
perfumed
them
with
sweetsmelling
leaves
however
this
food
although
very
strengthening
was
always
roast
upon
roast
and
the
party
would
have
been
delighted
to
hear
some
soup
bubbling
on
the
hearth
but
they
must
wait
till
a
pot
could
be
made
and
consequently
till
the
oven
was
built
during
these
excursions
which
were
not
extended
far
from
the
brickfield
the
hunters
could
discern
the
recent
passage
of
animals
of
a
large
size
armed
with
powerful
claws
but
they
could
not
recognize
the
species
cyrus
harding
advised
them
to
be
very
careful
as
the
forest
probably
enclosed
many
dangerous
beasts
and
he
did
right
indeed
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
one
day
saw
an
animal
which
resembled
a
jaguar
happily
the
creature
did
not
attack
them
or
they
might
not
have
escaped
without
a
severe
wound
as
soon
as
he
could
get
a
regular
weapon
that
is
to
say
one
of
the
guns
which
pencroft
begged
for
gideon
spilett
resolved
to
make
desperate
war
against
the
ferocious
beasts
and
exterminate
them
from
the
island
the
chimneys
during
these
few
days
was
not
made
more
comfortable
for
the
engineer
hoped
to
discover
or
build
if
necessary
a
more
convenient
dwelling
they
contented
themselves
with
spreading
moss
and
dry
leaves
on
the
sand
of
the
passages
and
on
these
primitive
couches
the
tired
workers
slept
soundly
they
also
reckoned
the
days
they
had
passed
on
lincoln
island
and
from
that
time
kept
a
regular
account
the
5th
of
april
which
was
wednesday
was
twelve
days
from
the
time
when
the
wind
threw
the
castaways
on
this
shore
on
the
6th
of
april
at
daybreak
the
engineer
and
his
companions
were
collected
in
the
glade
at
the
place
where
they
were
going
to
perform
the
operation
of
baking
the
bricks
naturally
this
had
to
be
in
the
open
air
and
not
in
a
kiln
or
rather
the
agglomeration
of
bricks
made
an
enormous
kiln
which
would
bake
itself
the
fuel
made
of
wellprepared
fagots
was
laid
on
the
ground
and
surrounded
with
several
rows
of
dried
bricks
which
soon
formed
an
enormous
cube
to
the
exterior
of
which
they
contrived
airholes
the
work
lasted
all
day
and
it
was
not
till
the
evening
that
they
set
fire
to
the
fagots
no
one
slept
that
night
all
watching
carefully
to
keep
up
the
fire
the
operation
lasted
fortyeight
hours
and
succeeded
perfectly
it
then
became
necessary
to
leave
the
smoking
mass
to
cool
and
during
this
time
neb
and
pencroft
guided
by
cyrus
harding
brought
on
a
hurdle
made
of
interlaced
branches
loads
of
carbonate
of
lime
and
common
stones
which
were
very
abundant
to
the
north
of
the
lake
these
stones
when
decomposed
by
heat
made
a
very
strong
quicklime
greatly
increased
by
slacking
at
least
as
pure
as
if
it
had
been
produced
by
the
calcination
of
chalk
or
marble
mixed
with
sand
the
lime
made
excellent
mortar
the
result
of
these
different
works
was
that
on
the
9th
of
april
the
engineer
had
at
his
disposal
a
quantity
of
prepared
lime
and
some
thousands
of
bricks
without
losing
an
instant
therefore
they
began
the
construction
of
a
kiln
to
bake
the
pottery
which
was
indispensable
for
their
domestic
use
they
succeeded
without
much
difficulty
five
days
after
the
kiln
was
supplied
with
coal
which
the
engineer
had
discovered
lying
open
to
the
sky
towards
the
mouth
of
the
red
creek
and
the
first
smoke
escaped
from
a
chimney
twenty
feet
high
the
glade
was
transformed
into
a
manufactory
and
pencroft
was
not
far
wrong
in
believing
that
from
this
kiln
would
issue
all
the
products
of
modern
industry
in
the
meantime
what
the
settlers
first
manufactured
was
a
common
pottery
in
which
to
cook
their
food
the
chief
material
was
clay
to
which
harding
added
a
little
lime
and
quartz
this
paste
made
regular
pipeclay
with
which
they
manufactured
bowls
cups
molded
on
stones
of
a
proper
size
great
jars
and
pots
to
hold
water
etc
the
shape
of
these
objects
was
clumsy
and
defective
but
after
they
had
been
baked
in
a
high
temperature
the
kitchen
of
the
chimneys
was
provided
with
a
number
of
utensils
as
precious
to
the
settlers
as
the
most
beautifully
enameled
china
we
must
mention
here
that
pencroft
desirous
to
know
if
the
clay
thus
prepared
was
worthy
of
its
name
of
pipeclay
made
some
large
pipes
which
he
thought
charming
but
for
which
alas
he
had
no
tobacco
and
that
was
a
great
privation
to
pencroft
but
tobacco
will
come
like
everything
else
he
repeated
in
a
burst
of
absolute
confidence
this
work
lasted
till
the
15th
of
april
and
the
time
was
well
employed
the
settlers
having
become
potters
made
nothing
but
pottery
when
it
suited
cyrus
harding
to
change
them
into
smiths
they
would
become
smiths
but
the
next
day
being
sunday
and
also
easter
sunday
all
agreed
to
sanctify
the
day
by
rest
these
americans
were
religious
men
scrupulous
observers
of
the
precepts
of
the
bible
and
their
situation
could
not
but
develop
sentiments
of
confidence
towards
the
author
of
all
things
on
the
evening
of
the
15th
of
april
they
returned
to
the
chimneys
carrying
with
them
the
pottery
the
furnace
being
extinguished
until
they
could
put
it
to
a
new
use
their
return
was
marked
by
a
fortunate
incident
the
engineer
discovered
a
substance
which
replaced
tinder
it
is
known
that
a
spongy
velvety
flesh
is
procured
from
a
certain
mushroom
of
the
genus
polyporous
properly
prepared
it
is
extremely
inflammable
especially
when
it
has
been
previously
saturated
with
gunpowder
or
boiled
in
a
solution
of
nitrate
or
chlorate
of
potash
but
till
then
they
had
not
found
any
of
these
polypores
or
even
any
of
the
morels
which
could
replace
them
on
this
day
the
engineer
seeing
a
plant
belonging
to
the
wormwood
genus
the
principal
species
of
which
are
absinthe
balmmint
tarragon
etc
gathered
several
tufts
and
presenting
them
to
the
sailor
said
here
pencroft
this
will
please
you
pencroft
looked
attentively
at
the
plant
covered
with
long
silky
hair
the
leaves
being
clothed
with
soft
down
whats
that
captain
asked
pencroft
is
it
tobacco
no
replied
harding
it
is
wormwood
chinese
wormwood
to
the
learned
but
to
us
it
will
be
tinder
when
the
wormwood
was
properly
dried
it
provided
them
with
a
very
inflammable
substance
especially
afterwards
when
the
engineer
had
impregnated
it
with
nitrate
of
potash
of
which
the
island
possessed
several
beds
and
which
is
in
truth
saltpeter
the
colonists
had
a
good
supper
that
evening
neb
prepared
some
agouti
soup
a
smoked
capybara
ham
to
which
was
added
the
boiled
tubercules
of
the
caladium
macrorhizum
an
herbaceous
plant
of
the
arum
family
they
had
an
excellent
taste
and
were
very
nutritious
being
something
similar
to
the
substance
which
is
sold
in
england
under
the
name
of
portland
sago
they
were
also
a
good
substitute
for
bread
which
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
did
not
yet
possess
when
supper
was
finished
before
sleeping
harding
and
his
companions
went
to
take
the
air
on
the
beach
it
was
eight
oclock
in
the
evening
the
night
was
magnificent
the
moon
which
had
been
full
five
days
before
had
not
yet
risen
but
the
horizon
was
already
silvered
by
those
soft
pale
shades
which
might
be
called
the
dawn
of
the
moon
at
the
southern
zenith
glittered
the
circumpolar
constellations
and
above
all
the
southern
cross
which
some
days
before
the
engineer
had
greeted
on
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
cyrus
harding
gazed
for
some
time
at
this
splendid
constellation
which
has
at
its
summit
and
at
its
base
two
stars
of
the
first
magnitude
at
its
left
arm
a
star
of
the
second
and
at
its
right
arm
a
star
of
the
third
magnitude
then
after
some
minutes
thought
herbert
he
asked
of
the
lad
is
not
this
the
15th
of
april
yes
captain
replied
herbert
well
if
i
am
not
mistaken
tomorrow
will
be
one
of
the
four
days
in
the
year
in
which
the
real
time
is
identical
with
average
time
that
is
to
say
my
boy
that
tomorrow
to
within
some
seconds
the
sun
will
pass
the
meridian
just
at
midday
by
the
clocks
if
the
weather
is
fine
i
think
that
i
shall
obtain
the
longitude
of
the
island
with
an
approximation
of
some
degrees
without
instruments
without
sextant
asked
gideon
spilett
yes
replied
the
engineer
also
since
the
night
is
clear
i
will
try
this
very
evening
to
obtain
our
latitude
by
calculating
the
height
of
the
southern
cross
that
is
from
the
southern
pole
above
the
horizon
you
understand
my
friends
that
before
undertaking
the
work
of
installation
in
earnest
it
is
not
enough
to
have
found
out
that
this
land
is
an
island
we
must
as
nearly
as
possible
know
at
what
distance
it
is
situated
either
from
the
american
continent
or
australia
or
from
the
principal
archipelagoes
of
the
pacific
in
fact
said
the
reporter
instead
of
building
a
house
it
would
be
more
important
to
build
a
boat
if
by
chance
we
are
not
more
than
a
hundred
miles
from
an
inhabited
coast
that
is
why
returned
harding
i
am
going
to
try
this
evening
to
calculate
the
latitude
of
lincoln
island
and
tomorrow
at
midday
i
will
try
to
calculate
the
longitude
if
the
engineer
had
possessed
a
sextant
an
apparatus
with
which
the
angular
distance
of
objects
can
be
measured
with
great
precision
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
in
the
operation
this
evening
by
the
height
of
the
pole
the
next
day
by
the
passing
of
the
sun
at
the
meridian
he
would
obtain
the
position
of
the
island
but
as
they
had
not
one
he
would
have
to
supply
the
deficiency
harding
then
entered
the
chimneys
by
the
light
of
the
fire
he
cut
two
little
flat
rulers
which
he
joined
together
at
one
end
so
as
to
form
a
pair
of
compasses
whose
legs
could
separate
or
come
together
the
fastening
was
fixed
with
a
strong
acacia
thorn
which
was
found
in
the
wood
pile
this
instrument
finished
the
engineer
returned
to
the
beach
but
as
it
was
necessary
to
take
the
height
of
the
pole
from
above
a
clear
horizon
that
is
a
sea
horizon
and
as
claw
cape
hid
the
southern
horizon
he
was
obliged
to
look
for
a
more
suitable
station
the
best
would
evidently
have
been
the
shore
exposed
directly
to
the
south
but
the
mercy
would
have
to
be
crossed
and
that
was
a
difficulty
harding
resolved
in
consequence
to
make
his
observation
from
prospect
heights
taking
into
consideration
its
height
above
the
level
of
the
seaa
height
which
he
intended
to
calculate
next
day
by
a
simple
process
of
elementary
geometry
the
settlers
therefore
went
to
the
plateau
ascending
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
and
placed
themselves
on
the
edge
which
looked
northwest
and
southeast
that
is
above
the
curiouslyshaped
rocks
which
bordered
the
river
this
part
of
the
plateau
commanded
the
heights
of
the
left
bank
which
sloped
away
to
the
extremity
of
claw
cape
and
to
the
southern
side
of
the
island
no
obstacle
intercepted
their
gaze
which
swept
the
horizon
in
a
semicircle
from
the
cape
to
reptile
end
to
the
south
the
horizon
lighted
by
the
first
rays
of
the
moon
was
very
clearly
defined
against
the
sky
at
this
moment
the
southern
cross
presented
itself
to
the
observer
in
an
inverted
position
the
star
alpha
marking
its
base
which
is
nearer
to
the
southern
pole
this
constellation
is
not
situated
as
near
to
the
antarctic
pole
as
the
polar
star
is
to
the
arctic
pole
the
star
alpha
is
about
twentyseven
degrees
from
it
but
cyrus
harding
knew
this
and
made
allowance
for
it
in
his
calculation
he
took
care
also
to
observe
the
moment
when
it
passed
the
meridian
below
the
pole
which
would
simplify
the
operation
cyrus
harding
pointed
one
leg
of
the
compasses
to
the
horizon
the
other
to
alpha
and
the
space
between
the
two
legs
gave
him
the
angular
distance
which
separated
alpha
from
the
horizon
in
order
to
fix
the
angle
obtained
he
fastened
with
thorns
the
two
pieces
of
wood
on
a
third
placed
transversely
so
that
their
separation
should
be
properly
maintained
that
done
there
was
only
the
angle
to
calculate
by
bringing
back
the
observation
to
the
level
of
the
sea
taking
into
consideration
the
depression
of
the
horizon
which
would
necessitate
measuring
the
height
of
the
cliff
the
value
of
this
angle
would
give
the
height
of
alpha
and
consequently
that
of
the
pole
above
the
horizon
that
is
to
say
the
latitude
of
the
island
since
the
latitude
of
a
point
of
the
globe
is
always
equal
to
the
height
of
the
pole
above
the
horizon
of
this
point
the
calculations
were
left
for
the
next
day
and
at
ten
oclock
every
one
was
sleeping
soundly

the
next
day
the
16th
of

easter
sunday
the
settlers
issued
from
the
chimneys
at
daybreak
and
proceeded
to
wash
their
linen
the
engineer
intended
to
manufacture
soap
as
soon
as
he
could
procure
the
necessary
materialssoda
or
potash
fat
or
oil
the
important
question
of
renewing
their
wardrobe
would
be
treated
of
in
the
proper
time
and
place
at
any
rate
their
clothes
would
last
at
least
six
months
longer
for
they
were
strong
and
could
resist
the
wear
of
manual
labor
but
all
would
depend
on
the
situation
of
the
island
with
regard
to
inhabited
land
this
would
be
settled
today
if
the
weather
permitted
the
sun
rising
above
a
clear
horizon
announced
a
magnificent
day
one
of
those
beautiful
autumn
days
which
are
like
the
last
farewells
of
the
warm
season
it
was
now
necessary
to
complete
the
observations
of
the
evening
before
by
measuring
the
height
of
the
cliff
above
the
level
of
the
sea
shall
you
not
need
an
instrument
similar
to
the
one
which
you
used
yesterday
said
herbert
to
the
engineer
no
my
boy
replied
the
latter
we
are
going
to
proceed
differently
but
in
as
precise
a
way
herbert
wishing
to
learn
everything
he
could
followed
the
engineer
to
the
beach
pencroft
neb
and
the
reporter
remained
behind
and
occupied
themselves
in
different
ways
cyrus
harding
had
provided
himself
with
a
straight
stick
twelve
feet
long
which
he
had
measured
as
exactly
as
possible
by
comparing
it
with
his
own
height
which
he
knew
to
a
hair
herbert
carried
a
plumbline
which
harding
had
given
him
that
is
to
say
a
simple
stone
fastened
to
the
end
of
a
flexible
fiber
having
reached
a
spot
about
twenty
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
beach
and
nearly
five
hundred
feet
from
the
cliff
which
rose
perpendicularly
harding
thrust
the
pole
two
feet
into
the
sand
and
wedging
it
up
carefully
he
managed
by
means
of
the
plumbline
to
erect
it
perpendicularly
with
the
plane
of
the
horizon
that
done
he
retired
the
necessary
distance
when
lying
on
the
sand
his
eye
glanced
at
the
same
time
at
the
top
of
the
pole
and
the
crest
of
the
cliff
he
carefully
marked
the
place
with
a
little
stick
then
addressing
herbertdo
you
know
the
first
principles
of
geometry
he
asked
slightly
captain
replied
herbert
who
did
not
wish
to
put
himself
forward
you
remember
what
are
the
properties
of
two
similar
triangles
yes
replied
herbert
their
homologous
sides
are
proportional
well
my
boy
i
have
just
constructed
two
similar
rightangled
triangles
the
first
the
smallest
has
for
its
sides
the
perpendicular
pole
the
distance
which
separates
the
little
stick
from
the
foot
of
the
pole
and
my
visual
ray
for
hypothenuse
the
second
has
for
its
sides
the
perpendicular
cliff
the
height
of
which
we
wish
to
measure
the
distance
which
separates
the
little
stick
from
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
and
my
visual
ray
also
forms
its
hypothenuse
which
proves
to
be
prolongation
of
that
of
the
first
triangle
ah
captain
i
understand
cried
herbert
as
the
distance
from
the
stick
to
the
pole
is
to
the
distance
from
the
stick
to
the
base
of
the
cliff
so
is
the
height
of
the
pole
to
the
height
of
the
cliff
just
so
herbert
replied
the
engineer
and
when
we
have
measured
the
two
first
distances
knowing
the
height
of
the
pole
we
shall
only
have
a
sum
in
proportion
to
do
which
will
give
us
the
height
of
the
cliff
and
will
save
us
the
trouble
of
measuring
it
directly
the
two
horizontal
distances
were
found
out
by
means
of
the
pole
whose
length
above
the
sand
was
exactly
ten
feet
the
first
distance
was
fifteen
feet
between
the
stick
and
the
place
where
the
pole
was
thrust
into
the
sand
the
second
distance
between
the
stick
and
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
was
five
hundred
feet
these
measurements
finished
cyrus
harding
and
the
lad
returned
to
the
chimneys
the
engineer
then
took
a
flat
stone
which
he
had
brought
back
from
one
of
his
previous
excursions
a
sort
of
slate
on
which
it
was
easy
to
trace
figures
with
a
sharp
shell
he
then
proved
the
following
proportions
1550010x
500
x
10

5000
5000

15

3333
from
which
it
was
proved
that
the
granite
cliff
measured
333
feet
in
height
cyrus
harding
then
took
the
instrument
which
he
had
made
the
evening
before
the
space
between
its
two
legs
giving
the
angular
distance
between
the
star
alpha
and
the
horizon
he
measured
very
exactly
the
opening
of
this
angle
on
a
circumference
which
he
divided
into
360
equal
parts
now
this
angle
by
adding
to
it
the
twentyseven
degrees
which
separated
alpha
from
the
antarctic
pole
and
by
reducing
to
the
level
of
the
sea
the
height
of
the
cliff
on
which
the
observation
had
been
made
was
found
to
be
fiftythree
degrees
these
fiftythree
degrees
being
subtracted
from
ninety
degreesthe
distance
from
the
pole
to
the
equatorthere
remained
thirtyseven
degrees
cyrus
harding
concluded
therefore
that
lincoln
island
was
situated
on
the
thirtyseventh
degree
of
the
southern
latitude
or
taking
into
consideration
through
the
imperfection
of
the
performance
an
error
of
five
degrees
that
it
must
be
situated
between
the
thirtyfifth
and
the
fortieth
parallel
there
was
only
the
longitude
to
be
obtained
and
the
position
of
the
island
would
be
determined
the
engineer
hoped
to
attempt
this
the
same
day
at
twelve
oclock
at
which
moment
the
sun
would
pass
the
meridian
it
was
decided
that
sunday
should
be
spent
in
a
walk
or
rather
an
exploring
expedition
to
that
side
of
the
island
between
the
north
of
the
lake
and
shark
gulf
and
if
there
was
time
they
would
push
their
discoveries
to
the
northern
side
of
cape
south
mandible
they
would
breakfast
on
the
downs
and
not
return
till
evening
at
halfpast
eight
the
little
band
was
following
the
edge
of
the
channel
on
the
other
side
on
safety
islet
numerous
birds
were
gravely
strutting
they
were
divers
easily
recognized
by
their
cry
which
much
resembles
the
braying
of
a
donkey
pencroft
only
considered
them
in
an
eatable
point
of
view
and
learnt
with
some
satisfaction
that
their
flesh
though
blackish
is
not
bad
food
great
amphibious
creatures
could
also
be
seen
crawling
on
the
sand
seals
doubtless
who
appeared
to
have
chosen
the
islet
for
a
place
of
refuge
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
those
animals
in
an
alimentary
point
of
view
for
their
oily
flesh
is
detestable
however
cyrus
harding
observed
them
attentively
and
without
making
known
his
idea
he
announced
to
his
companions
that
very
soon
they
would
pay
a
visit
to
the
islet
the
beach
was
strewn
with
innumerable
shells
some
of
which
would
have
rejoiced
the
heart
of
a
conchologist
there
were
among
others
the
phasianella
the
terebratual
etc
but
what
would
be
of
more
use
was
the
discovery
by
neb
at
low
tide
of
a
large
oysterbed
among
the
rocks
nearly
five
miles
from
the
chimneys
neb
will
not
have
lost
his
day
cried
pencroft
looking
at
the
spacious
oysterbed
it
is
really
a
fortunate
discovery
said
the
reporter
and
as
it
is
said
that
each
oyster
produces
yearly
from
fifty
to
sixty
thousand
eggs
we
shall
have
an
inexhaustible
supply
there
only
i
believe
that
the
oyster
is
not
very
nourishing
said
herbert
no
replied
harding
the
oyster
contains
very
little
nitrogen
and
if
a
man
lived
exclusively
on
them
he
would
have
to
eat
not
less
than
fifteen
to
sixteen
dozen
a
day
capital
replied
pencroft
we
might
swallow
dozens
and
dozens
without
exhausting
the
bed
shall
we
take
some
for
breakfast
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
to
this
proposal
knowing
that
it
would
be
approved
of
the
sailor
and
neb
detached
a
quantity
of
the
molluscs
they
put
them
in
a
sort
of
net
of
hibiscus
fiber
which
neb
had
manufactured
and
which
already
contained
food
they
then
continued
to
climb
the
coast
between
the
downs
and
the
sea
from
time
to
time
harding
consulted
his
watch
so
as
to
be
prepared
in
time
for
the
solar
observation
which
had
to
be
made
exactly
at
midday
all
that
part
of
the
island
was
very
barren
as
far
as
the
point
which
closed
union
bay
and
which
had
received
the
name
of
cape
south
mandible
nothing
could
be
seen
there
but
sand
and
shells
mingled
with
debris
of
lava
a
few
seabirds
frequented
this
desolate
coast
gulls
great
albatrosses
as
well
as
wild
duck
for
which
pencroft
had
a
great
fancy
he
tried
to
knock
some
over
with
an
arrow
but
without
result
for
they
seldom
perched
and
he
could
not
hit
them
on
the
wing
this
led
the
sailor
to
repeat
to
the
engineer
you
see
captain
so
long
as
we
have
not
one
or
two
fowlingpieces
we
shall
never
get
anything
doubtless
pencroft
replied
the
reporter
but
it
depends
on
you
procure
us
some
iron
for
the
barrels
steel
for
the
hammers
saltpeter
coal
and
sulphur
for
powder
mercury
and
nitric
acid
for
the
fulminate
and
lead
for
the
shot
and
the
captain
will
make
us
firstrate
guns
oh
replied
the
engineer
we
might
no
doubt
find
all
these
substances
on
the
island
but
a
gun
is
a
delicate
instrument
and
needs
very
particular
tools
however
we
shall
see
later
why
cried
pencroft
were
we
obliged
to
throw
overboard
all
the
weapons
we
had
with
us
in
the
car
all
our
implements
even
our
pocketknives
but
if
we
had
not
thrown
them
away
pencroft
the
balloon
would
have
thrown
us
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
said
herbert
what
you
say
is
true
my
boy
replied
the
sailor
then
passing
to
another
ideathink
said
he
how
astounded
jonathan
forster
and
his
companions
must
have
been
when
next
morning
they
found
the
place
empty
and
the
machine
flown
away
i
am
utterly
indifferent
about
knowing
what
they
may
have
thought
said
the
reporter
it
was
all
my
idea
that
said
pencroft
with
a
satisfied
air
a
splendid
idea
pencroft
replied
gideon
spilett
laughing
and
which
has
placed
us
where
we
are
i
would
rather
be
here
than
in
the
hands
of
the
southerners
cried
the
sailor
especially
since
the
captain
has
been
kind
enough
to
come
and
join
us
again
so
would
i
truly
replied
the
reporter
besides
what
do
we
want
nothing
if
that
is
noteverything
replied
pencroft
laughing
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
but
some
day
or
other
we
shall
find
means
of
going
away
sooner
perhaps
than
you
imagine
my
friends
remarked
the
engineer
if
lincoln
island
is
but
a
medium
distance
from
an
inhabited
island
or
from
a
continent
we
shall
know
in
an
hour
i
have
not
a
map
of
the
pacific
but
my
memory
has
preserved
a
very
clear
recollection
of
its
southern
part
the
latitude
which
i
obtained
yesterday
placed
new
zealand
to
the
west
of
lincoln
island
and
the
coast
of
chile
to
the
east
but
between
these
two
countries
there
is
a
distance
of
at
least
six
thousand
miles
it
has
therefore
to
be
determined
what
point
in
this
great
space
the
island
occupies
and
this
the
longitude
will
give
us
presently
with
a
sufficient
approximation
i
hope
is
not
the
archipelago
of
the
pomoutous
the
nearest
point
to
us
in
latitude
asked
herbert
yes
replied
the
engineer
but
the
distance
which
separates
us
from
it
is
more
than
twelve
hundred
miles
and
that
way
asked
neb
who
followed
the
conversation
with
extreme
interest
pointing
to
the
south
that
way
nothing
replied
pencroft
nothing
indeed
added
the
engineer
well
cyrus
asked
the
reporter
if
lincoln
island
is
not
more
than
two
or
three
thousand
miles
from
new
zealand
or
chile
well
replied
the
engineer
instead
of
building
a
house
we
will
build
a
boat
and
master
pencroft
shall
be
put
in
command
well
then
cried
the
sailor
i
am
quite
ready
to
be
captainas
soon
as
you
can
make
a
craft
thats
able
to
keep
at
sea
we
shall
do
it
if
it
is
necessary
replied
cyrus
harding
but
while
these
men
who
really
hesitated
at
nothing
were
talking
the
hour
approached
at
which
the
observation
was
to
be
made
what
cyrus
harding
was
to
do
to
ascertain
the
passage
of
the
sun
at
the
meridian
of
the
island
without
an
instrument
of
any
sort
herbert
could
not
guess
the
observers
were
then
about
six
miles
from
the
chimneys
not
far
from
that
part
of
the
downs
in
which
the
engineer
had
been
found
after
his
enigmatical
preservation
they
halted
at
this
place
and
prepared
for
breakfast
for
it
was
halfpast
eleven
herbert
went
for
some
fresh
water
from
a
stream
which
ran
near
and
brought
it
back
in
a
jug
which
neb
had
provided
during
these
preparations
harding
arranged
everything
for
his
astronomical
observation
he
chose
a
clear
place
on
the
shore
which
the
ebbing
tide
had
left
perfectly
level
this
bed
of
fine
sand
was
as
smooth
as
ice
not
a
grain
out
of
place
it
was
of
little
importance
whether
it
was
horizontal
or
not
and
it
did
not
matter
much
whether
the
stick
six
feet
high
which
was
planted
there
rose
perpendicularly
on
the
contrary
the
engineer
inclined
it
towards
the
south
that
is
to
say
in
the
direction
of
the
coast
opposite
to
the
sun
for
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
as
the
island
was
situated
in
the
southern
hemisphere
saw
the
radiant
planet
describe
its
diurnal
arc
above
the
northern
and
not
above
the
southern
horizon
herbert
now
understood
how
the
engineer
was
going
to
proceed
to
ascertain
the
culmination
of
the
sun
that
is
to
say
its
passing
the
meridian
of
the
island
or
in
other
words
determine
due
south
it
was
by
means
of
the
shadow
cast
on
the
sand
by
the
stick
a
way
which
for
want
of
an
instrument
would
give
him
a
suitable
approach
to
the
result
which
he
wished
to
obtain
in
fact
the
moment
when
this
shadow
would
reach
its
minimum
of
length
would
be
exactly
twelve
oclock
and
it
would
be
enough
to
watch
the
extremity
of
the
shadow
so
as
to
ascertain
the
instant
when
after
having
successively
diminished
it
began
to
lengthen
by
inclining
his
stick
to
the
side
opposite
to
the
sun
cyrus
harding
made
the
shadow
longer
and
consequently
its
modifications
would
be
more
easily
ascertained
in
fact
the
longer
the
needle
of
a
dial
is
the
more
easily
can
the
movement
of
its
point
be
followed
the
shadow
of
the
stick
was
nothing
but
the
needle
of
a
dial
the
moment
had
come
and
cyrus
harding
knelt
on
the
sand
and
with
little
wooden
pegs
which
he
stuck
into
the
sand
he
began
to
mark
the
successive
diminutions
of
the
sticks
shadow
his
companions
bending
over
him
watched
the
operation
with
extreme
interest
the
reporter
held
his
chronometer
in
his
hand
ready
to
tell
the
hour
which
it
marked
when
the
shadow
would
be
at
its
shortest
moreover
as
cyrus
harding
was
working
on
the
16th
of
april
the
day
on
which
the
true
and
the
average
time
are
identical
the
hour
given
by
gideon
spilett
would
be
the
true
hour
then
at
washington
which
would
simplify
the
calculation
meanwhile
as
the
sun
slowly
advanced
the
shadow
slowly
diminished
and
when
it
appeared
to
cyrus
harding
that
it
was
beginning
to
increase
he
asked
what
oclock
is
it
one
minute
past
five
replied
gideon
spilett
directly
they
had
now
only
to
calculate
the
operation
nothing
could
be
easier
it
could
be
seen
that
there
existed
in
round
numbers
a
difference
of
five
hours
between
the
meridian
of
washington
and
that
of
lincoln
island
that
is
to
say
it
was
midday
in
lincoln
island
when
it
was
already
five
oclock
in
the
evening
in
washington
now
the
sun
in
its
apparent
movement
round
the
earth
traverses
one
degree
in
four
minutes
or
fifteen
degrees
an
hour
fifteen
degrees
multiplied
by
five
hours
give
seventyfive
degrees
then
since
washington
is
77deg
3
11
as
much
as
to
say
seventyseven
degrees
counted
from
the
meridian
of
greenwich
which
the
americans
take
for
their
startingpoint
for
longitudes
concurrently
with
the
englishit
followed
that
the
island
must
be
situated
seventyseven
and
seventyfive
degrees
west
of
the
meridian
of
greenwich
that
is
to
say
on
the
hundred
and
fiftysecond
degree
of
west
longitude
cyrus
harding
announced
this
result
to
his
companions
and
taking
into
consideration
errors
of
observation
as
he
had
done
for
the
latitude
he
believed
he
could
positively
affirm
that
the
position
of
lincoln
island
was
between
the
thirtyfifth
and
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
and
between
the
hundred
and
fiftieth
and
the
hundred
and
fiftyfifth
meridian
to
the
west
of
the
meridian
of
greenwich
the
possible
fault
which
he
attributed
to
errors
in
the
observation
was
it
may
be
seen
of
five
degrees
on
both
sides
which
at
sixty
miles
to
a
degree
would
give
an
error
of
three
hundred
miles
in
latitude
and
longitude
for
the
exact
position
but
this
error
would
not
influence
the
determination
which
it
was
necessary
to
take
it
was
very
evident
that
lincoln
island
was
at
such
a
distance
from
every
country
or
island
that
it
would
be
too
hazardous
to
attempt
to
reach
one
in
a
frail
boat
in
fact
this
calculation
placed
it
at
least
twelve
hundred
miles
from
tahiti
and
the
islands
of
the
archipelago
of
the
pomoutous
more
than
eighteen
hundred
miles
from
new
zealand
and
more
than
four
thousand
five
hundred
miles
from
the
american
coast
and
when
cyrus
harding
consulted
his
memory
he
could
not
remember
in
any
way
that
such
an
island
occupied
in
that
part
of
the
pacific
the
situation
assigned
to
lincoln
island
chapter
15
the
next
day
the
17th
of
april
the
sailors
first
words
were
addressed
to
gideon
spilett
well
sir
he
asked
what
shall
we
do
today
what
the
captain
pleases
replied
the
reporter
till
then
the
engineers
companions
had
been
brickmakers
and
potters
now
they
were
to
become
metallurgists
the
day
before
after
breakfast
they
had
explored
as
far
as
the
point
of
mandible
cape
seven
miles
distant
from
the
chimneys
there
the
long
series
of
downs
ended
and
the
soil
had
a
volcanic
appearance
there
were
no
longer
high
cliffs
as
at
prospect
heights
but
a
strange
and
capricious
border
which
surrounded
the
narrow
gulf
between
the
two
capes
formed
of
mineral
matter
thrown
up
by
the
volcano
arrived
at
this
point
the
settlers
retraced
their
steps
and
at
nightfall
entered
the
chimneys
but
they
did
not
sleep
before
the
question
of
knowing
whether
they
could
think
of
leaving
lincoln
island
or
not
was
definitely
settled
the
twelve
hundred
miles
which
separated
the
island
from
the
pomoutous
island
was
a
considerable
distance
a
boat
could
not
cross
it
especially
at
the
approach
of
the
bad
season
pencroft
had
expressly
declared
this
now
to
construct
a
simple
boat
even
with
the
necessary
tools
was
a
difficult
work
and
the
colonists
not
having
tools
they
must
begin
by
making
hammers
axes
adzes
saws
augers
planes
etc
which
would
take
some
time
it
was
decided
therefore
that
they
would
winter
at
lincoln
island
and
that
they
would
look
for
a
more
comfortable
dwelling
than
the
chimneys
in
which
to
pass
the
winter
months
before
anything
else
could
be
done
it
was
necessary
to
make
the
iron
ore
of
which
the
engineer
had
observed
some
traces
in
the
northwest
part
of
the
island
fit
for
use
by
converting
it
either
into
iron
or
into
steel
metals
are
not
generally
found
in
the
ground
in
a
pure
state
for
the
most
part
they
are
combined
with
oxygen
or
sulphur
such
was
the
case
with
the
two
specimens
which
cyrus
harding
had
brought
back
one
of
magnetic
iron
not
carbonated
the
other
a
pyrite
also
called
sulphuret
of
iron
it
was
therefore
the
first
the
oxide
of
iron
which
they
must
reduce
with
coal
that
is
to
say
get
rid
of
the
oxygen
to
obtain
it
in
a
pure
state
this
reduction
is
made
by
subjecting
the
ore
with
coal
to
a
high
temperature
either
by
the
rapid
and
easy
catalan
method
which
has
the
advantage
of
transforming
the
ore
into
iron
in
a
single
operation
or
by
the
blast
furnace
which
first
smelts
the
ore
then
changes
it
into
iron
by
carrying
away
the
three
to
four
per
cent
of
coal
which
is
combined
with
it
now
cyrus
harding
wanted
iron
and
he
wished
to
obtain
it
as
soon
as
possible
the
ore
which
he
had
picked
up
was
in
itself
very
pure
and
rich
it
was
the
oxydulous
iron
which
is
found
in
confused
masses
of
a
deep
gray
color
it
gives
a
black
dust
crystallized
in
the
form
of
the
regular
octahedron
native
lodestones
consist
of
this
ore
and
iron
of
the
first
quality
is
made
in
europe
from
that
with
which
sweden
and
norway
are
so
abundantly
supplied
not
far
from
this
vein
was
the
vein
of
coal
already
made
use
of
by
the
settlers
the
ingredients
for
the
manufacture
being
close
together
would
greatly
facilitate
the
treatment
of
the
ore
this
is
the
cause
of
the
wealth
of
the
mines
in
great
britain
where
the
coal
aids
the
manufacture
of
the
metal
extracted
from
the
same
soil
at
the
same
time
as
itself
then
captain
said
pencroft
we
are
going
to
work
iron
ore
yes
my
friend
replied
the
engineer
and
for
thatsomething
which
will
please
youwe
must
begin
by
having
a
seal
hunt
on
the
islet
a
seal
hunt
cried
the
sailor
turning
towards
gideon
spilett
are
seals
needed
to
make
iron
since
cyrus
has
said
so
replied
the
reporter
but
the
engineer
had
already
left
the
chimneys
and
pencroft
prepared
for
the
seal
hunt
without
having
received
any
other
explanation
cyrus
harding
herbert
gideon
spilett
neb
and
the
sailor
were
soon
collected
on
the
shore
at
a
place
where
the
channel
left
a
ford
passable
at
low
tide
the
hunters
could
therefore
traverse
it
without
getting
wet
higher
than
the
knee
harding
then
put
his
foot
on
the
islet
for
the
first
and
his
companions
for
the
second
time
on
their
landing
some
hundreds
of
penguins
looked
fearlessly
at
them
the
hunters
armed
with
sticks
could
have
killed
them
easily
but
they
were
not
guilty
of
such
useless
massacre
as
it
was
important
not
to
frighten
the
seals
who
were
lying
on
the
sand
several
cable
lengths
off
they
also
respected
certain
innocentlooking
birds
whose
wings
were
reduced
to
the
state
of
stumps
spread
out
like
fins
ornamented
with
feathers
of
a
scaly
appearance
the
settlers
therefore
prudently
advanced
towards
the
north
point
walking
over
ground
riddled
with
little
holes
which
formed
nests
for
the
seabirds
towards
the
extremity
of
the
islet
appeared
great
black
heads
floating
just
above
the
water
having
exactly
the
appearance
of
rocks
in
motion
these
were
the
seals
which
were
to
be
captured
it
was
necessary
however
first
to
allow
them
to
land
for
with
their
close
short
hair
and
their
fusiform
conformation
being
excellent
swimmers
it
is
difficult
to
catch
them
in
the
sea
while
on
land
their
short
webbed
feet
prevent
their
having
more
than
a
slow
waddling
movement
pencroft
knew
the
habits
of
these
creatures
and
he
advised
waiting
till
they
were
stretched
on
the
sand
when
the
sun
before
long
would
send
them
to
sleep
they
must
then
manage
to
cut
off
their
retreat
and
knock
them
on
the
head
the
hunters
having
concealed
themselves
behind
the
rocks
waited
silently
an
hour
passed
before
the
seals
came
to
play
on
the
sand
they
could
count
half
a
dozen
pencroft
and
herbert
then
went
round
the
point
of
the
islet
so
as
to
take
them
in
the
rear
and
cut
off
their
retreat
during
this
time
cyrus
harding
spilett
and
neb
crawling
behind
the
rocks
glided
towards
the
future
scene
of
combat
all
at
once
the
tall
figure
of
the
sailor
appeared
pencroft
shouted
the
engineer
and
his
two
companions
threw
themselves
between
the
sea
and
the
seals
two
of
the
animals
soon
lay
dead
on
the
sand
but
the
rest
regained
the
sea
in
safety
here
are
the
seals
required
captain
said
the
sailor
advancing
towards
the
engineer
capital
replied
harding
we
will
make
bellows
of
them
bellows
cried
pencroft
well
these
are
lucky
seals
it
was
in
fact
a
blowingmachine
necessary
for
the
treatment
of
the
ore
that
the
engineer
wished
to
manufacture
with
the
skins
of
the
amphibious
creatures
they
were
of
a
medium
size
for
their
length
did
not
exceed
six
feet
they
resembled
a
dog
about
the
head
as
it
was
useless
to
burden
themselves
with
the
weight
of
both
the
animals
neb
and
pencroft
resolved
to
skin
them
on
the
spot
while
cyrus
harding
and
the
reporter
continued
to
explore
the
islet
the
sailor
and
the
negro
cleverly
performed
the
operation
and
three
hours
afterwards
cyrus
harding
had
at
his
disposal
two
seals
skins
which
he
intended
to
use
in
this
state
without
subjecting
them
to
any
tanning
process
the
settlers
waited
till
the
tide
was
again
low
and
crossing
the
channel
they
entered
the
chimneys
the
skins
had
then
to
be
stretched
on
a
frame
of
wood
and
sewn
by
means
of
fibers
so
as
to
preserve
the
air
without
allowing
too
much
to
escape
cyrus
harding
had
nothing
but
the
two
steel
blades
from
tops
collar
and
yet
he
was
so
clever
and
his
companions
aided
him
with
so
much
intelligence
that
three
days
afterwards
the
little
colonys
stock
of
tools
was
augmented
by
a
blowingmachine
destined
to
inject
the
air
into
the
midst
of
the
ore
when
it
should
be
subjected
to
heatan
indispensable
condition
to
the
success
of
the
operation
on
the
morning
of
the
20th
of
april
began
the
metallic
period
as
the
reporter
called
it
in
his
notes
the
engineer
had
decided
as
has
been
said
to
operate
near
the
veins
both
of
coal
and
ore
now
according
to
his
observations
these
veins
were
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
northeast
spurs
of
mount
franklin
that
is
to
say
a
distance
of
six
miles
from
their
home
it
was
impossible
therefore
to
return
every
day
to
the
chimneys
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
little
colony
should
camp
under
a
hut
of
branches
so
that
the
important
operation
could
be
followed
night
and
day
this
settled
they
set
out
in
the
morning
neb
and
pencroft
dragged
the
bellows
on
a
hurdle
also
a
quantity
of
vegetables
and
animals
which
they
besides
could
renew
on
the
way
the
road
led
through
jacamar
wood
which
they
traversed
obliquely
from
southeast
to
northwest
and
in
the
thickest
part
it
was
necessary
to
beat
a
path
which
would
in
the
future
form
the
most
direct
road
to
prospect
heights
and
mount
franklin
the
trees
belonging
to
the
species
already
discovered
were
magnificent
herbert
found
some
new
ones
among
others
some
which
pencroft
called
sham
leeks
for
in
spite
of
their
size
they
were
of
the
same
liliaceous
family
as
the
onion
chive
shallot
or
asparagus
these
trees
produce
ligneous
roots
which
when
cooked
are
excellent
from
them
by
fermentation
a
very
agreeable
liquor
is
made
they
therefore
made
a
good
store
of
the
roots
the
journey
through
the
wood
was
long
it
lasted
the
whole
day
and
so
allowed
plenty
of
time
for
examining
the
flora
and
fauna
top
who
took
special
charge
of
the
fauna
ran
through
the
grass
and
brushwood
putting
up
all
sorts
of
game
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
killed
two
kangaroos
with
bows
and
arrows
and
also
an
animal
which
strongly
resembled
both
a
hedgehog
and
an
anteater
it
was
like
the
first
because
it
rolled
itself
into
a
ball
and
bristled
with
spines
and
the
second
because
it
had
sharp
claws
a
long
slender
snout
which
terminated
in
a
birds
beak
and
an
extendible
tongue
covered
with
little
thorns
which
served
to
hold
the
insects
and
when
it
is
in
the
pot
asked
pencroft
naturally
what
will
it
be
like
an
excellent
piece
of
beef
replied
herbert
we
will
not
ask
more
from
it
replied
the
sailor
during
this
excursion
they
saw
several
wild
boars
which
however
did
not
offer
to
attack
the
little
band
and
it
appeared
as
if
they
would
not
meet
with
any
dangerous
beasts
when
in
a
thick
part
of
the
wood
the
reporter
thought
he
saw
some
paces
from
him
among
the
lower
branches
of
a
tree
an
animal
which
he
took
for
a
bear
and
which
he
very
tranquilly
began
to
draw
happily
for
gideon
spilett
the
animal
in
question
did
not
belong
to
the
redoubtable
family
of
the
plantigrades
it
was
only
a
koala
better
known
under
the
name
of
the
sloth
being
about
the
size
of
a
large
dog
and
having
stiff
hair
of
a
dirty
color
the
paws
armed
with
strong
claws
which
enabled
it
to
climb
trees
and
feed
on
the
leaves
having
identified
the
animal
which
they
did
not
disturb
gideon
spilett
erased
bear
from
the
title
of
his
sketch
putting
koala
in
its
place
and
the
journey
was
resumed
at
five
oclock
in
the
evening
cyrus
harding
gave
the
signal
to
halt
they
were
now
outside
the
forest
at
the
beginning
of
the
powerful
spurs
which
supported
mount
franklin
towards
the
west
at
a
distance
of
some
hundred
feet
flowed
the
red
creek
and
consequently
plenty
of
fresh
water
was
within
their
reach
the
camp
was
soon
organized
in
less
than
an
hour
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
among
the
trees
a
hut
of
branches
interlaced
with
creepers
and
pasted
over
with
clay
offered
a
tolerable
shelter
their
geological
researches
were
put
off
till
the
next
day
supper
was
prepared
a
good
fire
blazed
before
the
hut
the
roast
turned
and
at
eight
oclock
while
one
of
the
settlers
watched
to
keep
up
the
fire
in
case
any
wild
beasts
should
prowl
in
the
neighborhood
the
others
slept
soundly
the
next
day
the
21st
of
april
cyrus
harding
accompanied
by
herbert
went
to
look
for
the
soil
of
ancient
formation
on
which
he
had
already
discovered
a
specimen
of
ore
they
found
the
vein
above
ground
near
the
source
of
the
creek
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
northeastern
spurs
this
ore
very
rich
in
iron
enclosed
in
its
fusible
veinstone
was
perfectly
suited
to
the
mode
of
reduction
which
the
engineer
intended
to
employ
that
is
the
catalan
method
but
simplified
as
it
is
used
in
corsica
in
fact
the
catalan
method
properly
so
called
requires
the
construction
of
kilns
and
crucibles
in
which
the
ore
and
the
coal
placed
in
alternate
layers
are
transformed
and
reduced
but
cyrus
harding
intended
to
economize
these
constructions
and
wished
simply
to
form
with
the
ore
and
the
coal
a
cubic
mass
to
the
center
of
which
he
would
direct
the
wind
from
his
bellows
doubtless
it
was
the
proceeding
employed
by
tubalcain
and
the
first
metallurgists
of
the
inhabited
world
now
that
which
had
succeeded
with
the
grandson
of
adam
and
which
still
yielded
good
results
in
countries
rich
in
ore
and
fuel
could
not
but
succeed
with
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
the
coal
as
well
as
the
ore
was
collected
without
trouble
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
they
first
broke
the
ore
into
little
pieces
and
cleansed
them
with
the
hand
from
the
impurities
which
soiled
their
surface
then
coal
and
ore
were
arranged
in
heaps
and
in
successive
layers
as
the
charcoalburner
does
with
the
wood
which
he
wishes
to
carbonize
in
this
way
under
the
influence
of
the
air
projected
by
the
blowingmachine
the
coal
would
be
transformed
into
carbonic
acid
then
into
oxide
of
carbon
its
use
being
to
reduce
the
oxide
of
iron
that
is
to
say
to
rid
it
of
the
oxygen
thus
the
engineer
proceeded
the
bellows
of
sealskin
furnished
at
its
extremity
with
a
nozzle
of
clay
which
had
been
previously
fabricated
in
the
pottery
kiln
was
established
near
the
heap
of
ore
using
the
mechanism
which
consisted
of
a
frame
cords
of
fiber
and
counterpoise
he
threw
into
the
mass
an
abundance
of
air
which
by
raising
the
temperature
also
concurred
with
the
chemical
transformation
to
produce
in
time
pure
iron
the
operation
was
difficult
all
the
patience
all
the
ingenuity
of
the
settlers
was
needed
but
at
last
it
succeeded
and
the
result
was
a
lump
of
iron
reduced
to
a
spongy
state
which
it
was
necessary
to
shingle
and
fagot
that
is
to
say
to
forge
so
as
to
expel
from
it
the
liquefied
veinstone
these
amateur
smiths
had
of
course
no
hammer
but
they
were
in
no
worse
a
situation
than
the
first
metallurgist
and
therefore
did
what
no
doubt
he
had
to
do
a
handle
was
fixed
to
the
first
lump
and
was
used
as
a
hammer
to
forge
the
second
on
a
granite
anvil
and
thus
they
obtained
a
coarse
but
useful
metal
at
length
after
many
trials
and
much
fatigue
on
the
25th
of
april
several
bars
of
iron
were
forged
and
transformed
into
tools
crowbars
pincers
pickaxes
spades
etc
which
pencroft
and
neb
declared
to
be
real
jewels
but
the
metal
was
not
yet
in
its
most
serviceable
state
that
is
of
steel
now
steel
is
a
combination
of
iron
and
coal
which
is
extracted
either
from
the
liquid
ore
by
taking
from
it
the
excess
of
coal
or
from
the
iron
by
adding
to
it
the
coal
which
was
wanting
the
first
obtained
by
the
decarburation
of
the
metal
gives
natural
or
puddled
steel
the
second
produced
by
the
carburation
of
the
iron
gives
steel
of
cementation
it
was
the
last
which
cyrus
harding
intended
to
forge
as
he
possessed
iron
in
a
pure
state
he
succeeded
by
heating
the
metal
with
powdered
coal
in
a
crucible
which
had
previously
been
manufactured
from
clay
suitable
for
the
purpose
he
then
worked
this
steel
which
is
malleable
both
when
hot
or
cold
with
the
hammer
neb
and
pencroft
cleverly
directed
made
hatchets
which
heated
redhot
and
plunged
suddenly
into
cold
water
acquired
an
excellent
temper
other
instruments
of
course
roughly
fashioned
were
also
manufactured
blades
for
planes
axes
hatchets
pieces
of
steel
to
be
transformed
into
saws
chisels
then
iron
for
spades
pickaxes
hammers
nails
etc
at
last
on
the
5th
of
may
the
metallic
period
ended
the
smiths
returned
to
the
chimneys
and
new
work
would
soon
authorize
them
to
take
a
fresh
title
chapter
16
it
was
the
6th
of
may
a
day
which
corresponds
to
the
6th
of
november
in
the
countries
of
the
northern
hemisphere
the
sky
had
been
obscured
for
some
days
and
it
was
of
importance
to
make
preparations
for
the
winter
however
the
temperature
was
not
as
yet
much
lower
and
a
centigrade
thermometer
transported
to
lincoln
island
would
still
have
marked
an
average
of
ten
to
twelve
degrees
above
zero
this
was
not
surprising
since
lincoln
island
probably
situated
between
the
thirtyfifth
and
fortieth
parallel
would
be
subject
in
the
southern
hemisphere
to
the
same
climate
as
sicily
or
greece
in
the
northern
hemisphere
but
as
greece
and
sicily
have
severe
cold
producing
snow
and
ice
so
doubtless
would
lincoln
island
in
the
severest
part
of
the
winter
and
it
was
advisable
to
provide
against
it
in
any
case
if
cold
did
not
yet
threaten
them
the
rainy
season
would
begin
and
on
this
lonely
island
exposed
to
all
the
fury
of
the
elements
in
midocean
bad
weather
would
be
frequent
and
probably
terrible
the
question
of
a
more
comfortable
dwelling
than
the
chimneys
must
therefore
be
seriously
considered
and
promptly
resolved
on
pencroft
naturally
had
some
predilection
for
the
retreat
which
he
had
discovered
but
he
well
understood
that
another
must
be
found
the
chimneys
had
been
already
visited
by
the
sea
under
circumstances
which
are
known
and
it
would
not
do
to
be
exposed
again
to
a
similar
accident
besides
added
cyrus
harding
who
this
day
was
talking
of
these
things
with
his
companions
we
have
some
precautions
to
take
why
the
island
is
not
inhabited
said
the
reporter
that
is
probable
replied
the
engineer
although
we
have
not
yet
explored
the
interior
but
if
no
human
beings
are
found
i
fear
that
dangerous
animals
may
abound
it
is
necessary
to
guard
against
a
possible
attack
so
that
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
watch
every
night
or
to
keep
up
a
fire
and
then
my
friends
we
must
foresee
everything
we
are
here
in
a
part
of
the
pacific
often
frequented
by
malay
pirates
what
said
herbert
at
such
a
distance
from
land
yes
my
boy
replied
the
engineer
these
pirates
are
bold
sailors
as
well
as
formidable
enemies
and
we
must
take
measures
accordingly
well
replied
pencroft
we
will
fortify
ourselves
against
savages
with
two
legs
as
well
as
against
savages
with
four
but
captain
will
it
not
be
best
to
explore
every
part
of
the
island
before
undertaking
anything
else
that
would
be
best
added
gideon
spilett
who
knows
if
we
might
not
find
on
the
opposite
side
one
of
the
caverns
which
we
have
searched
for
in
vain
here
that
is
true
replied
the
engineer
but
you
forget
my
friends
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
establish
ourselves
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
watercourse
and
that
from
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
we
could
not
see
towards
the
west
either
stream
or
river
here
on
the
contrary
we
are
placed
between
the
mercy
and
lake
grant
an
advantage
which
must
not
be
neglected
and
besides
this
side
looking
towards
the
east
is
not
exposed
as
the
other
is
to
the
tradewinds
which
in
this
hemisphere
blow
from
the
northwest
then
captain
replied
the
sailor
let
us
build
a
house
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
neither
bricks
nor
tools
are
wanting
now
after
having
been
brickmakers
potters
smelters
and
smiths
we
shall
surely
know
how
to
be
masons
yes
my
friend
but
before
coming
to
any
decision
we
must
consider
the
matter
thoroughly
a
natural
dwelling
would
spare
us
much
work
and
would
be
a
surer
retreat
for
it
would
be
as
well
defended
against
enemies
from
the
interior
as
those
from
outside
that
is
true
cyrus
replied
the
reporter
but
we
have
already
examined
all
that
mass
of
granite
and
there
is
not
a
hole
not
a
cranny
no
not
one
added
pencroft
ah
if
we
were
able
to
dig
out
a
dwelling
in
that
cliff
at
a
good
height
so
as
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
harm
that
would
be
capital
i
can
see
that
on
the
front
which
looks
seaward
five
or
six
rooms
with
windows
to
light
them
said
herbert
laughing
and
a
staircase
to
climb
up
to
them
added
neb
you
are
laughing
cried
the
sailor
and
why
what
is
there
impossible
in
what
i
propose
havent
we
got
pickaxes
and
spades
wont
captain
harding
be
able
to
make
powder
to
blow
up
the
mine
isnt
it
true
captain
that
you
will
make
powder
the
very
day
we
want
it
cyrus
harding
listened
to
the
enthusiastic
pencroft
developing
his
fanciful
projects
to
attack
this
mass
of
granite
even
by
a
mine
was
herculean
work
and
it
was
really
vexing
that
nature
could
not
help
them
at
their
need
but
the
engineer
did
not
reply
to
the
sailor
except
by
proposing
to
examine
the
cliff
more
attentively
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
to
the
angle
which
terminated
it
on
the
north
they
went
out
therefore
and
the
exploration
was
made
with
extreme
care
over
an
extent
of
nearly
two
miles
but
in
no
place
in
the
bare
straight
cliff
could
any
cavity
be
found
the
nests
of
the
rock
pigeons
which
fluttered
at
its
summit
were
only
in
reality
holes
bored
at
the
very
top
and
on
the
irregular
edge
of
the
granite
it
was
a
provoking
circumstance
and
as
to
attacking
this
cliff
either
with
pickaxe
or
with
powder
so
as
to
effect
a
sufficient
excavation
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
it
so
happened
that
on
all
this
part
of
the
shore
pencroft
had
discovered
the
only
habitable
shelter
that
is
to
say
the
chimneys
which
now
had
to
be
abandoned
the
exploration
ended
the
colonists
found
themselves
at
the
north
angle
of
the
cliff
where
it
terminated
in
long
slopes
which
died
away
on
the
shore
from
this
place
to
its
extreme
limit
in
the
west
it
only
formed
a
sort
of
declivity
a
thick
mass
of
stones
earth
and
sand
bound
together
by
plants
bushes
and
grass
inclined
at
an
angle
of
only
fortyfive
degrees
clumps
of
trees
grew
on
these
slopes
which
were
also
carpeted
with
thick
grass
but
the
vegetation
did
not
extend
far
and
a
long
sandy
plain
which
began
at
the
foot
of
these
slopes
reached
to
the
beach
cyrus
harding
thought
not
without
reason
that
the
overplus
of
the
lake
must
overflow
on
this
side
the
excess
of
water
furnished
by
the
red
creek
must
also
escape
by
some
channel
or
other
now
the
engineer
had
not
yet
found
this
channel
on
any
part
of
the
shore
already
explored
that
is
to
say
from
the
mouth
of
the
stream
on
the
west
of
prospect
heights
the
engineer
now
proposed
to
his
companions
to
climb
the
slope
and
to
return
to
the
chimneys
by
the
heights
while
exploring
the
northern
and
eastern
shores
of
the
lake
the
proposal
was
accepted
and
in
a
few
minutes
herbert
and
neb
were
on
the
upper
plateau
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
and
pencroft
followed
with
more
sedate
steps
the
beautiful
sheet
of
water
glittered
through
the
trees
under
the
rays
of
the
sun
in
this
direction
the
country
was
charming
the
eye
feasted
on
the
groups
of
trees
some
old
trunks
bent
with
age
showed
black
against
the
verdant
grass
which
covered
the
ground
crowds
of
brilliant
cockatoos
screamed
among
the
branches
moving
prisms
hopping
from
one
bough
to
another
the
settlers
instead
of
going
directly
to
the
north
bank
of
the
lake
made
a
circuit
round
the
edge
of
the
plateau
so
as
to
join
the
mouth
of
the
creek
on
its
left
bank
it
was
a
detour
of
more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
walking
was
easy
for
the
trees
widely
spread
left
a
considerable
space
between
them
the
fertile
zone
evidently
stopped
at
this
point
and
vegetation
would
be
less
vigorous
in
the
part
between
the
course
of
the
creek
and
the
mercy
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
walked
over
this
new
ground
with
great
care
bows
arrows
and
sticks
with
sharp
iron
points
were
their
only
weapons
however
no
wild
beast
showed
itself
and
it
was
probable
that
these
animals
frequented
rather
the
thick
forests
in
the
south
but
the
settlers
had
the
disagreeable
surprise
of
seeing
top
stop
before
a
snake
of
great
size
measuring
from
fourteen
to
fifteen
feet
in
length
neb
killed
it
by
a
blow
from
his
stick
cyrus
harding
examined
the
reptile
and
declared
it
not
venomous
for
it
belonged
to
that
species
of
diamond
serpents
which
the
natives
of
new
south
wales
rear
but
it
was
possible
that
others
existed
whose
bite
was
mortal
such
as
the
deaf
vipers
with
forked
tails
which
rise
up
under
the
feet
or
those
winged
snakes
furnished
with
two
ears
which
enable
them
to
proceed
with

a
reptile
chase
with
such
eagerness
that
they
feared
for
his
safety
his
master
called
him
back
directly
the
mouth
of
the
red
creek
at
the
place
where
it
entered
into
the
lake
was
soon
reached
the
explorers
recognized
on
the
opposite
shore
the
point
which
they
had
visited
on
their
descent
from
mount
franklin
cyrus
harding
ascertained
that
the
flow
of
water
into
it
from
the
creek
was
considerable
nature
must
therefore
have
provided
some
place
for
the
escape
of
the
overplus
this
doubtless
formed
a
fall
which
if
it
could
be
discovered
would
be
of
great
use
the
colonists
walking
apart
but
not
straying
far
from
each
other
began
to
skirt
the
edge
of
the
lake
which
was
very
steep
the
water
appeared
to
be
full
of
fish
and
pencroft
resolved
to
make
some
fishingrods
so
as
to
try
and
catch
some
the
northeast
point
was
first
to
be
doubled
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
the
discharge
of
water
was
at
this
place
for
the
extremity
of
the
lake
was
almost
on
a
level
with
the
edge
of
the
plateau
but
no
signs
of
this
were
discovered
and
the
colonists
continued
to
explore
the
bank
which
after
a
slight
bend
descended
parallel
to
the
shore
on
this
side
the
banks
were
less
woody
but
clumps
of
trees
here
and
there
added
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
country
lake
grant
was
viewed
from
thence
in
all
its
extent
and
no
breath
disturbed
the
surface
of
its
waters
top
in
beating
the
bushes
put
up
flocks
of
birds
of
different
kinds
which
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
saluted
with
arrows
one
was
hit
by
the
lad
and
fell
into
some
marshy
grass
top
rushed
forward
and
brought
a
beautiful
swimming
bird
of
a
slate
color
short
beak
very
developed
frontal
plate
and
wings
edged
with
white
it
was
a
coot
the
size
of
a
large
partridge
belonging
to
the
group
of
macrodactyls
which
form
the
transition
between
the
order
of
wading
birds
and
that
of
palmipeds
sorry
game
in
truth
and
its
flavor
is
far
from
pleasant
but
top
was
not
so
particular
in
these
things
as
his
masters
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
coot
should
be
for
his
supper
the
settlers
were
now
following
the
eastern
bank
of
the
lake
and
they
would
not
be
long
in
reaching
the
part
which
they
already
knew
the
engineer
was
much
surprised
at
not
seeing
any
indication
of
the
discharge
of
water
the
reporter
and
the
sailor
talked
with
him
and
he
could
not
conceal
his
astonishment
at
this
moment
top
who
had
been
very
quiet
till
then
gave
signs
of
agitation
the
intelligent
animal
went
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
shore
stopped
suddenly
and
looked
at
the
water
one
paw
raised
as
if
he
was
pointing
at
some
invisible
game
then
he
barked
furiously
and
was
suddenly
silent
neither
cyrus
harding
nor
his
companions
had
at
first
paid
any
attention
to
tops
behavior
but
the
dogs
barking
soon
became
so
frequent
that
the
engineer
noticed
it
what
is
there
top
he
asked
the
dog
bounded
towards
his
master
seeming
to
be
very
uneasy
and
then
rushed
again
towards
the
bank
then
all
at
once
he
plunged
into
the
lake
here
top
cried
cyrus
harding
who
did
not
like
his
dog
to
venture
into
the
treacherous
water
whats
happening
down
there
asked
pencroft
examining
the
surface
of
the
lake
top
smells
some
amphibious
creature
replied
herbert
an
alligator
perhaps
said
the
reporter
i
do
not
think
so
replied
harding
alligators
are
only
met
with
in
regions
less
elevated
in
latitude
meanwhile
top
had
returned
at
his
masters
call
and
had
regained
the
shore
but
he
could
not
stay
quiet
he
plunged
in
among
the
tall
grass
and
guided
by
instinct
he
appeared
to
follow
some
invisible
being
which
was
slipping
along
under
the
surface
of
the
water
however
the
water
was
calm
not
a
ripple
disturbed
its
surface
several
times
the
settlers
stopped
on
the
bank
and
observed
it
attentively
nothing
appeared
there
was
some
mystery
there
the
engineer
was
puzzled
let
us
pursue
this
exploration
to
the
end
said
he
half
an
hour
after
they
had
all
arrived
at
the
southeast
angle
of
the
lake
on
prospect
heights
at
this
point
the
examination
of
the
banks
of
the
lake
was
considered
finished
and
yet
the
engineer
had
not
been
able
to
discover
how
and
where
the
waters
were
discharged
there
is
no
doubt
this
overflow
exists
he
repeated
and
since
it
is
not
visible
it
must
go
through
the
granite
cliff
at
the
west
but
what
importance
do
you
attach
to
knowing
that
my
dear
cyrus
asked
gideon
spilett
considerable
importance
replied
the
engineer
for
if
it
flows
through
the
cliff
there
is
probably
some
cavity
which
it
would
be
easy
to
render
habitable
after
turning
away
the
water
but
is
it
not
possible
captain
that
the
water
flows
away
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
said
herbert
and
that
it
reaches
the
sea
by
some
subterranean
passage
that
might
be
replied
the
engineer
and
should
it
be
so
we
shall
be
obliged
to
build
our
house
ourselves
since
nature
has
not
done
it
for
us
the
colonists
were
about
to
begin
to
traverse
the
plateau
to
return
to
the
chimneys
when
top
gave
new
signs
of
agitation
he
barked
with
fury
and
before
his
master
could
restrain
him
he
had
plunged
a
second
time
into
the
lake
all
ran
towards
the
bank
the
dog
was
already
more
than
twenty
feet
off
and
cyrus
was
calling
him
back
when
an
enormous
head
emerged
from
the
water
which
did
not
appear
to
be
deep
in
that
place
herbert
recognized
directly
the
species
of
amphibian
to
which
the
tapering
head
with
large
eyes
and
adorned
with
long
silky
mustaches
belonged
a
lamantin
he
cried
it
was
not
a
lamantin
but
one
of
that
species
of
the
order
of
cetaceans
which
bear
the
name
of
the
dugong
for
its
nostrils
were
open
at
the
upper
part
of
its
snout
the
enormous
animal
rushed
on
the
dog
who
tried
to
escape
by
returning
towards
the
shore
his
master
could
do
nothing
to
save
him
and
before
gideon
spilett
or
herbert
thought
of
bending
their
bows
top
seized
by
the
dugong
had
disappeared
beneath
the
water
neb
his
irontipped
spear
in
his
hand
wished
to
go
to
tops
help
and
attack
the
dangerous
animal
in
its
own
element
no
neb
said
the
engineer
restraining
his
courageous
servant
meanwhile
a
struggle
was
going
on
beneath
the
water
an
inexplicable
struggle
for
in
his
situation
top
could
not
possibly
resist
and
judging
by
the
bubbling
of
the
surface
it
must
be
also
a
terrible
struggle
and
could
not
but
terminate
in
the
death
of
the
dog
but
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
foaming
circle
top
reappeared
thrown
in
the
air
by
some
unknown
power
he
rose
ten
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
lake
fell
again
into
the
midst
of
the
agitated
waters
and
then
soon
gained
the
shore
without
any
severe
wounds
miraculously
saved
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
could
not
understand
it
what
was
not
less
inexplicable
was
that
the
struggle
still
appeared
to
be
going
on
doubtless
the
dugong
attacked
by
some
powerful
animal
after
having
released
the
dog
was
fighting
on
its
own
account
but
it
did
not
last
long
the
water
became
red
with
blood
and
the
body
of
the
dugong
emerging
from
the
sheet
of
scarlet
which
spread
around
soon
stranded
on
a
little
beach
at
the
south
angle
of
the
lake
the
colonists
ran
towards
it
the
dugong
was
dead
it
was
an
enormous
animal
fifteen
or
sixteen
feet
long
and
must
have
weighed
from
three
to
four
thousand
pounds
at
its
neck
was
a
wound
which
appeared
to
have
been
produced
by
a
sharp
blade
what
could
the
amphibious
creature
have
been
who
by
this
terrible
blow
had
destroyed
the
formidable
dugong
no
one
could
tell
and
much
interested
in
this
incident
harding
and
his
companions
returned
to
the
chimneys
chapter
17
the
next
day
the
7th
of
may
harding
and
gideon
spilett
leaving
neb
to
prepare
breakfast
climbed
prospect
heights
while
herbert
and
pencroft
ascended
by
the
river
to
renew
their
store
of
wood
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
soon
reached
the
little
beach
on
which
the
dugong
had
been
stranded
already
flocks
of
birds
had
attacked
the
mass
of
flesh
and
had
to
be
driven
away
with
stones
for
cyrus
wished
to
keep
the
fat
for
the
use
of
the
colony
as
to
the
animals
flesh
it
would
furnish
excellent
food
for
in
the
islands
of
the
malay
archipelago
and
elsewhere
it
is
especially
reserved
for
the
table
of
the
native
princes
but
that
was
nebs
affair
at
this
moment
cyrus
harding
had
other
thoughts
he
was
much
interested
in
the
incident
of
the
day
before
he
wished
to
penetrate
the
mystery
of
that
submarine
combat
and
to
ascertain
what
monster
could
have
given
the
dugong
so
strange
a
wound
he
remained
at
the
edge
of
the
lake
looking
observing
but
nothing
appeared
under
the
tranquil
waters
which
sparkled
in
the
first
rays
of
the
rising
sun
at
the
beach
on
which
lay
the
body
of
the
dugong
the
water
was
tolerably
shallow
but
from
this
point
the
bottom
of
the
lake
sloped
gradually
and
it
was
probable
that
the
depth
was
considerable
in
the
center
the
lake
might
be
considered
as
a
large
center
basin
which
was
filled
by
the
water
from
the
red
creek
well
cyrus
said
the
reporter
there
seems
to
be
nothing
suspicious
in
this
water
no
my
dear
spilett
replied
the
engineer
and
i
really
do
not
know
how
to
account
for
the
incident
of
yesterday
i
acknowledge
returned
spilett
that
the
wound
given
this
creature
is
at
least
very
strange
and
i
cannot
explain
either
how
top
was
so
vigorously
cast
up
out
of
the
water
one
could
have
thought
that
a
powerful
arm
hurled
him
up
and
that
the
same
arm
with
a
dagger
killed
the
dugong
yes
replied
the
engineer
who
had
become
thoughtful
there
is
something
there
that
i
cannot
understand
but
do
you
better
understand
either
my
dear
spilett
in
what
way
i
was
saved
myselfhow
i
was
drawn
from
the
waves
and
carried
to
the
downs
no
is
it
not
true
now
i
feel
sure
that
there
is
some
mystery
there
which
doubtless
we
shall
discover
some
day
let
us
observe
but
do
not
dwell
on
these
singular
incidents
before
our
companions
let
us
keep
our
remarks
to
ourselves
and
continue
our
work
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
engineer
had
not
as
yet
been
able
to
discover
the
place
where
the
surplus
water
escaped
but
he
knew
it
must
exist
somewhere
he
was
much
surprised
to
see
a
strong
current
at
this
place
by
throwing
in
some
bits
of
wood
he
found
that
it
set
towards
the
southern
angle
he
followed
the
current
and
arrived
at
the
south
point
of
the
lake
there
was
there
a
sort
of
depression
in
the
water
as
if
it
was
suddenly
lost
in
some
fissure
in
the
ground
harding
listened
placing
his
ear
to
the
level
of
the
lake
he
very
distinctly
heard
the
noise
of
a
subterranean
fall
there
said
he
rising
is
the
discharge
of
the
water
there
doubtless
by
a
passage
in
the
granite
cliff
it
joins
the
sea
through
cavities
which
we
can
use
to
our
profit
well
i
can
find
it
the
engineer
cut
a
long
branch
stripped
it
of
its
leaves
and
plunging
it
into
the
angle
between
the
two
banks
he
found
that
there
was
a
large
hole
one
foot
only
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
this
hole
was
the
opening
so
long
looked
for
in
vain
and
the
force
of
the
current
was
such
that
the
branch
was
torn
from
the
engineers
hands
and
disappeared
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
now
repeated
harding
there
is
the
outlet
and
i
will
lay
it
open
to
view
how
asked
gideon
spilett
by
lowering
the

of
the
water
of
the
lake
three
feet
and
how
will
you
lower
the
level
by
opening
another
outlet
larger
than
this
at
what
place
cyrus
at
the
part
of
the
bank
nearest
the
coast
but
it
is
a
mass
of
granite
observed
spilett
well
replied
cyrus
harding
i
will
blow
up
the
granite
and
the
water
escaping
will
subside
so
as
to
lay
bare
this
opening
and
make
a
waterfall
by
falling
on
to
the
beach
added
the
reporter
a
fall
that
we
shall
make
use
of
replied
cyrus
come
come
the
engineer
hurried
away
his
companion
whose
confidence
in
harding
was
such
that
he
did
not
doubt
the
enterprise
would
succeed
and
yet
how
was
this
granite
wall
to
be
opened
without
powder
and
with
imperfect
instruments
was
not
this
work
upon
which
the
engineer
was
so
bent
above
their
strength
when
harding
and
the
reporter
entered
the
chimneys
they
found
herbert
and
pencroft
unloading
their
raft
of
wood
the
woodmen
have
just
finished
captain
said
the
sailor
laughing
and
when
you
want
masons
masonsno
but
chemists
replied
the
engineer
yes
added
the
reporter
we
are
going
to
blow
up
the
island
blow
up
the
island
cried
pencroft
part
of
it
at
least
replied
spilett
listen
to
me
my
friends
said
the
engineer
and
he
made
known
to
them
the
result
of
his
observations
according
to
him
a
cavity
more
or
less
considerable
must
exist
in
the
mass
of
granite
which
supported
prospect
heights
and
he
intended
to
penetrate
into
it
to
do
this
the
opening
through
which
the
water
rushed
must
first
be
cleared
and
the
level
lowered
by
making
a
larger
outlet
therefore
an
explosive
substance
must
be
manufactured
which
would
make
a
deep
trench
in
some
other
part
of
the
shore
this
was
what
harding
was
going
to
attempt
with
the
minerals
which
nature
placed
at
his
disposal
it
is
useless
to
say
with
what
enthusiasm
all
especially
pencroft
received
this
project
to
employ
great
means
open
the
granite
create
a
cascade
that
suited
the
sailor
and
he
would
just
as
soon
be
a
chemist
as
a
mason
or
bootmaker
since
the
engineer
wanted
chemicals
he
would
be
all
that
they
liked
even
a
professor
of
dancing
and
deportment
said
he
to
neb
if
that
was
ever
necessary
neb
and
pencroft
were
first
of
all
told
to
extract
the
grease
from
the
dugong
and
to
keep
the
flesh
which
was
destined
for
food
such
perfect
confidence
had
they
in
the
engineer
that
they
set
out
directly
without
even
asking
a
question
a
few
minutes
after
them
cyrus
harding
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
dragging
the
hurdle
went
towards
the
vein
of
coals
where
those
shistose
pyrites
abound
which
are
met
with
in
the
most
recent
transition
soil
and
of
which
harding
had
already
found
a
specimen
all
the
day
being
employed
in
carrying
a
quantity
of
these
stones
to
the
chimneys
by
evening
they
had
several
tons
the
next
day
the
8th
of
may
the
engineer
began
his
manipulations
these
shistose
pyrites
being
composed
principally
of
coal
flint
alumina
and
sulphuret
of
ironthe
latter
in
excessit
was
necessary
to
separate
the
sulphuret
of
iron
and
transform
it
into
sulphate
as
rapidly
as
possible
the
sulphate
obtained
the
sulphuric
acid
could
then
be
extracted
this
was
the
object
to
be
attained
sulphuric
acid
is
one
of
the
agents
the
most
frequently
employed
and
the
manufacturing
importance
of
a
nation
can
be
measured
by
the
consumption
which
is
made
of
it
this
acid
would
later
be
of
great
use
to
the
settlers
in
the
manufacturing
of
candles
tanning
skins
etc
but
this
time
the
engineer
reserved
it
for
another
use
cyrus
harding
chose
behind
the
chimneys
a
site
where
the
ground
was
perfectly
level
on
this
ground
he
placed
a
layer
of
branches
and
chopped
wood
on
which
were
piled
some
pieces
of
shistose
pyrites
buttressed
one
against
the
other
the
whole
being
covered
with
a
thin
layer
of
pyrites
previously
reduced
to
the
size
of
a
nut
this
done
they
set
fire
to
the
wood
the
heat
was
communicated
to
the
shist
which
soon
kindled
since
it
contains
coal
and
sulphur
then
new
layers
of
bruised
pyrites
were
arranged
so
as
to
form
an
immense
heap
the
exterior
of
which
was
covered
with
earth
and
grass
several
airholes
being
left
as
if
it
was
a
stack
of
wood
which
was
to
be
carbonized
to
make
charcoal
they
then
left
the
transformation
to
complete
itself
and
it
would
not
take
less
than
ten
or
twelve
days
for
the
sulphuret
of
iron
to
be
changed
to
sulphate
of
iron
and
the
alumina
into
sulphate
of
alumina
two
equally
soluble
substances
the
others
flint
burnt
coal
and
cinders
not
being
so
while
this
chemical
work
was
going
on
cyrus
harding
proceeded
with
other
operations
which
were
pursued
with
more
than
zealit
was
eagerness
neb
and
pencroft
had
taken
away
the
fat
from
the
dugong
and
placed
it
in
large
earthen
pots
it
was
then
necessary
to
separate
the
glycerine
from
the
fat
by
saponifying
it
now
to
obtain
this
result
it
had
to
be
treated
either
with
soda
or
lime
in
fact
one
or
other
of
these
substances
after
having
attacked
the
fat
would
form
a
soap
by
separating
the
glycerine
and
it
was
just
this
glycerine
which
the
engineer
wished
to
obtain
there
was
no
want
of
lime
only
treatment
by
lime
would
give
calcareous
soap
insoluble
and
consequently
useless
while
treatment
by
soda
would
furnish
on
the
contrary
a
soluble
soap
which
could
be
put
to
domestic
use
now
a
practical
man
like
cyrus
harding
would
rather
try
to
obtain
soda
was
this
difficult
no
for
marine
plants
abounded
on
the
shore
glasswort
ficoides
and
all
those
fucaceae
which
form
wrack
a
large
quantity
of
these
plants
was
collected
first
dried
then
burnt
in
holes
in
the
open
air
the
combustion
of
these
plants
was
kept
up
for
several
days
and
the
result
was
a
compact
gray
mass
which
has
been
long
known
under
the
name
of
natural
soda
this
obtained
the
engineer
treated
the
fat
with
soda
which
gave
both
a
soluble
soap
and
that
neutral
substance
glycerine
but
this
was
not
all
cyrus
harding
still
needed
in
view
of
his
future
preparation
another
substance
nitrate
of
potash
which
is
better
known
under
the
name
of
salt
niter
or
of
saltpeter
cyrus
harding
could
have
manufactured
this
substance
by
treating
the
carbonate
of
potash
which
would
be
easily
extracted
from
the
cinders
of
the
vegetables
by
azotic
acid
but
this
acid
was
wanting
and
he
would
have
been
in
some
difficulty
if
nature
had
not
happily
furnished
the
saltpeter
without
giving
them
any
other
trouble
than
that
of
picking
it
up
herbert
found
a
vein
of
it
at
the
foot
of
mount
franklin
and
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
purify
this
salt
these
different
works
lasted
a
week
they
were
finished
before
the
transformation
of
the
sulphuret
into
sulphate
of
iron
had
been
accomplished
during
the
following
days
the
settlers
had
time
to
construct
a
furnace
of
bricks
of
a
particular
arrangement
to
serve
for
the
distillation
of
the
sulphate
or
iron
when
it
had
been
obtained
all
this
was
finished
about
the
18th
of
may
nearly
at
the
time
when
the
chemical
transformation
terminated
gideon
spilett
herbert
neb
and
pencroft
skillfully
directed
by
the
engineer
had
become
most
clever
workmen
before
all
masters
necessity
is
the
one
most
listened
to
and
who
teaches
the
best
when
the
heap
of
pyrites
had
been
entirely
reduced
by
fire
the
result
of
the
operation
consisting
of
sulphate
of
iron
sulphate
of
alumina
flint
remains
of
coal
and
cinders
was
placed
in
a
basinful
of
water
they
stirred
this
mixture
let
it
settle
then
decanted
it
and
obtained
a
clear
liquid
containing
in
solution
sulphate
of
iron
and
sulphate
of
alumina
the
other
matters
remaining
solid
since
they
are
insoluble
lastly
this
liquid
being
partly
evaporated
crystals
of
sulphate
of
iron
were
deposited
and
the
not
evaporated
liquid
which
contained
the
sulphate
of
alumina
was
thrown
away
cyrus
harding
had
now
at
his
disposal
a
large
quantity
of
these
sulphate
of
iron
crystals
from
which
the
sulphuric
acid
had
to
be
extracted
the
making
of
sulphuric
acid
is
a
very
expensive
manufacture
considerable
works
are
necessarya
special
set
of
tools
an
apparatus
of
platina
leaden
chambers
unassailable
by
the
acid
and
in
which
the
transformation
is
performed
etc
the
engineer
had
none
of
these
at
his
disposal
but
he
knew
that
in
bohemia
especially
sulphuric
acid
is
manufactured
by
very
simple
means
which
have
also
the
advantage
of
producing
it
to
a
superior
degree
of
concentration
it
is
thus
that
the
acid
known
under
the
name
of
nordhausen
acid
is
made
to
obtain
sulphuric
acid
cyrus
harding
had
only
one
operation
to
make
to
calcine
the
sulphate
of
iron
crystals
in
a
closed
vase
so
that
the
sulphuric
acid
should
distil
in
vapor
which
vapor
by
condensation
would
produce
the
acid
the
crystals
were
placed
in
pots
and
the
heat
from
the
furnace
would
distil
the
sulphuric
acid
the
operation
was
successfully
completed
and
on
the
20th
of
may
twelve
days
after
commencing
it
the
engineer
was
the
possessor
of
the
agent
which
later
he
hoped
to
use
in
so
many
different
ways
now
why
did
he
wish
for
this
agent
simply
to
produce
azotic
acid
and
that
was
easy
since
saltpeter
attacked
by
sulphuric
acid
gives
azotic
or
nitric
acid
by
distillation
but
after
all
how
was
he
going
to
employ
this
azotic
acid
his
companions
were
still
ignorant
of
this
for
he
had
not
informed
them
of
the
result
at
which
he
aimed
however
the
engineer
had
nearly
accomplished
his
purpose
and
by
a
last
operation
he
would
procure
the
substance
which
had
given
so
much
trouble
taking
some
azotic
acid
he
mixed
it
with
glycerine
which
had
been
previously
concentrated
by
evaporation
subjected
to
the
waterbath
and
he
obtained
without
even
employing
a
refrigerant
mixture
several
pints
of
an
oily
yellow
mixture
this
last
operation
cyrus
harding
had
made
alone
in
a
retired
place
at
a
distance
from
the
chimneys
for
he
feared
the
danger
of
an
explosion
and
when
he
showed
a
bottle
of
this
liquid
to
his
friends
he
contented
himself
with
saying
here
is
nitroglycerine
it
was
really
this
terrible
production
of
which
the
explosive
power
is
perhaps
tenfold
that
of
ordinary
powder
and
which
has
already
caused
so
many
accidents
however
since
a
way
has
been
found
to
transform
it
into
dynamite
that
is
to
say
to
mix
with
it
some
solid
substance
clay
or
sugar
porous
enough
to
hold
it
the
dangerous
liquid
has
been
used
with
some
security
but
dynamite
was
not
yet
known
at
the
time
when
the
settlers
worked
on
lincoln
island
and
is
it
that
liquid
that
is
going
to
blow
up
our
rocks
said
pencroft
incredulously
yes
my
friend
replied
the
engineer
and
this
nitroglycerine
will
produce
so
much
the
more
effect
as
the
granite
is
extremely
hard
and
will
oppose
a
greater
resistance
to
the
explosion
and
when
shall
we
see
this
captain
tomorrow
as
soon
as
we
have
dug
a
hole
for
the
mine
replied
the
engineer
the
next
day
the
21st
of
may
at
daybreak
the
miners
went
to
the
point
which
formed
the
eastern
shore
of
lake
grant
and
was
only
five
hundred
feet
from
the
coast
at
this
place
the
plateau
inclined
downwards
from
the
waters
which
were
only
restrained
by
their
granite
case
therefore
if
this
case
was
broken
the
water
would
escape
by
the
opening
and
form
a
stream
which
flowing
over
the
inclined
surface
of
the
plateau
would
rush
on
to
the
beach
consequently
the
level
of
the
lake
would
be
greatly
lowered
and
the
opening
where
the
water
escaped
would
be
exposed
which
was
their
final
aim
under
the
engineers
directions
pencroft
armed
with
a
pickaxe
which
he
handled
skillfully
and
vigorously
attacked
the
granite
the
hole
was
made
on
the
point
of
the
shore
slanting
so
that
it
should
meet
a
much
lower
level
than
that
of
the
water
of
the
lake
in
this
way
the
explosive
force
by
scattering
the
rock
would
open
a
large
place
for
the
water
to
rush
out
the
work
took
some
time
for
the
engineer
wishing
to
produce
a
great
effect
intended
to
devote
not
less
than
seven
quarts
of
nitroglycerine
to
the
operation
but
pencroft
relieved
by
neb
did
so
well
that
towards
four
oclock
in
the
evening
the
mine
was
finished
now
the
question
of
setting
fire
to
the
explosive
substance
was
raised
generally
nitroglycerine
is
ignited
by
caps
of
fulminate
which
in
bursting
cause
the
explosion
a
shock
is
therefore
needed
to
produce
the
explosion
for
simply
lighted
this
substance
would
burn
without
exploding
cyrus
harding
could
certainly
have
fabricated
a
percussion
cap
in
default
of
fulminate
he
could
easily
obtain
a
substance
similar
to
guncotton
since
he
had
azotic
acid
at
his
disposal
this
substance
pressed
in
a
cartridge
and
introduced
among
the
nitroglycerine
would
burst
by
means
of
a
fuse
and
cause
the
explosion
but
cyrus
harding
knew
that
nitroglycerine
would
explode
by
a
shock
he
resolved
to
employ
this
means
and
try
another
way
if
this
did
not
succeed
in
fact
the
blow
of
a
hammer
on
a
few
drops
of
nitroglycerine
spread
out
on
a
hard
surface
was
enough
to
create
an
explosion
but
the
operator
could
not
be
there
to
give
the
blow
without
becoming
a
victim
to
the
operation
harding
therefore
thought
of
suspending
a
mass
of
iron
weighing
several
pounds
by
means
of
a
fiber
to
an
upright
just
above
the
mine
another
long
fiber
previously
impregnated
with
sulphur
was
attached
to
the
middle
of
the
first
by
one
end
while
the
other
lay
on
the
ground
several
feet
distant
from
the
mine
the
second
fiber
being
set
on
fire
it
would
burn
till
it
reached
the
first
this
catching
fire
in
its
turn
would
break
and
the
mass
of
iron
would
fall
on
the
nitroglycerine
this
apparatus
being
then
arranged
the
engineer
after
having
sent
his
companions
to
a
distance
filled
the
hole
so
that
the
nitroglycerine
was
on
a
level
with
the
opening
then
he
threw
a
few
drops
of
it
on
the
surface
of
the
rock
above
which
the
mass
of
iron
was
already
suspended
this
done
harding
lit
the
end
of
the
sulphured
fiber
and
leaving
the
place
he
returned
with
his
companions
to
the
chimneys
the
fiber
was
intended
to
burn
five
and
twenty
minutes
and
in
fact
five
and
twenty
minutes
afterwards
a
most
tremendous
explosion
was
heard
the
island
appeared
to
tremble
to
its
very
foundation
stones
were
projected
in
the
air
as
if
by
the
eruption
of
a
volcano
the
shock
produced
by
the
displacing
of
the
air
was
such
that
the
rocks
of
the
chimneys
shook
the
settlers
although
they
were
more
than
two
miles
from
the
mine
were
thrown
on
the
ground
they
rose
climbed
the
plateau
and
ran
towards
the
place
where
the
bank
of
the
lake
must
have
been
shattered
by
the
explosion
a
cheer
escaped
them
a
large
rent
was
seen
in
the
granite
a
rapid
stream
of
water
rushed
foaming
across
the
plateau
and
dashed
down
a
height
of
three
hundred
feet
on
to
the
beach

according
to

showed
no

with

he
remained

in

with
joy
pencroft
nodded
his
great
head
murmuring
these
words
come
our
engineer
gets
on
capitally
the
nitroglycerine
had
indeed
acted
powerfully
the
opening
which
it
had
made
was
so
large
that
the
volume
of
water
which
escaped
through
this
new
outlet
was
at
least
treble
that
which
before
passed
through
the
old
one
the
result
was
that
a
short
time
after
the
operation
the
level
of
the
lake
would
be
lowered
two
feet
or
more
the
settlers
went
to
the
chimneys
to
take
some
pickaxes
irontipped
spears
string
made
of
fibers
flint
and
steel
they
then
returned
to
the
plateau
top
accompanying
them
on
the
way
the
sailor
could
not
help
saying
to
the
engineer
dont
you
think
captain
that
by
means
of
that
charming
liquid
you
have
made
one
could
blow
up
the
whole
of
our
island
without
any
doubt
the
island
continents
and
the
world
itself
replied
the
engineer
it
is
only
a
question
of
quantity
then
could
you
not
use
this
nitroglycerine
for
loading
firearms
asked
the
sailor
no
pencroft
for
it
is
too
explosive
a
substance
but
it
would
be
easy
to
make
some
guncotton
or
even
ordinary
powder
as
we
have
azotic
acid
saltpeter
sulphur
and
coal
unhappily
it
is
the
guns
which
we
have
not
got
oh
captain
replied
the
sailor
with
a
little
determination
pencroft
had
erased
the
word
impossible
from
the
dictionary
of
lincoln
island
the
settlers
having
arrived
at
prospect
heights
went
immediately
towards
that
point
of
the
lake
near
which
was
the
old
opening
now
uncovered
this
outlet
had
now
become
practicable
since
the
water
no
longer
rushed
through
it
and
it
would
doubtless
be
easy
to
explore
the
interior
in
a
few
minutes
the
settlers
had
reached
the
lower
point
of
the
lake
and
a
glance
showed
them
that
the
object
had
been
attained
in
fact
in
the
side
of
the
lake
and
now
above
the
surface
of
the
water
appeared
the
longlookedfor
opening
a
narrow
ridge
left
bare
by
the
retreat
of
the
water
allowed
them
to
approach
it
this
orifice
was
nearly
twenty
feet
in
width
but
scarcely
two
in
height
it
was
like
the
mouth
of
a
drain
at
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
therefore
did
not
offer
an
easy
passage
to
the
settlers
but
neb
and
pencroft
taking
their
pickaxes
soon
made
it
of
a
suitable
height
the
engineer
then
approached
and
found
that
the
sides
of
the
opening
in
its
upper
part
at
least
had
not
a
slope
of
more
than
from
thirty
to
thirtyfive
degrees
it
was
therefore
practicable
and
provided
that
the
declivity
did
not
increase
it
would
be
easy
to
descend
even
to
the
level
of
the
sea
if
then
as
was
probable
some
vast
cavity
existed
in
the
interior
of
the
granite
it
might
perhaps
be
of
great
use
well
captain
what
are
we
stopping
for
asked
the
sailor
impatient
to
enter
the
narrow
passage
you
see
top
has
got
before
us
very
well
replied
the
engineer
but
we
must
see
our
way
neb
go
and
cut
some
resinous
branches
neb
and
herbert
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
shaded
with
pines
and
other
green
trees
and
soon
returned
with
some
branches
which
they
made
into
torches
the
torches
were
lighted
with
flint
and
steel
and
cyrus
harding
leading
the
settlers
ventured
into
the
dark
passage
which
the
overplus
of
the
lake
had
formerly
filled
contrary
to
what
might
have
been
supposed
the
diameter
of
the
passage
increased
as
the
explorers
proceeded
so
that
they
very
soon
were
able
to
stand
upright
the
granite
worn
by
the
water
for
an
infinite
time
was
very
slippery
and
falls
were
to
be
dreaded
but
the
settlers
were
all
attached
to
each
other
by
a
cord
as
is
frequently
done
in
ascending
mountains
happily
some
projections
of
the
granite
forming
regular
steps
made
the
descent
less
perilous
drops
still
hanging
from
the
rocks
shone
here
and
there
under
the
light
of
the
torches
and
the
explorers
guessed
that
the
sides
were
clothed
with
innumerable
stalactites
the
engineer
examined
this
black
granite
there
was
not
a
stratum
not
a
break
in
it
the
mass
was
compact
and
of
an
extremely
close
grain
the
passage
dated
then
from
the
very
origin
of
the
island
it
was
not
the
water
which
little
by
little
had
hollowed
it
pluto
and
not
neptune
had
bored
it
with
his
own
hand
and
on
the
wall
traces
of
an
eruptive
work
could
be
distinguished
which
all
the
washing
of
the
water
had
not
been
able
totally
to
efface
the
settlers
descended
very
slowly
they
could
not
but
feel
a
certain
awe
in
this
venturing
into
these
unknown
depths
for
the
first
time
visited
by
human
beings
they
did
not
speak
but
they
thought
and
the
thought
came
to
more
than
one
that
some
polypus
or
other
gigantic
cephalopod
might
inhabit
the
interior
cavities
which
were
in
communication
with
the
sea
however
top
kept
at
the
head
of
the
little
band
and
they
could
rely
on
the
sagacity
of
the
dog
who
would
not
fail
to
give
the
alarm
if
there
was
any
need
for
it
after
having
descended
about
a
hundred
feet
following
a
winding
road
harding
who
was
walking
on
before
stopped
and
his
companions
came
up
with
him
the
place
where
they
had
halted
was
wider
so
as
to
form
a
cavern
of
moderate
dimensions
drops
of
water
fell
from
the
vault
but
that
did
not
prove
that
they
oozed
through
the
rock
they
were
simply
the
last
traces
left
by
the
torrent
which
had
so
long
thundered
through
this
cavity
and
the
air
there
was
pure
though
slightly
damp
but
producing
no
mephitic
exhalation
well
my
dear
cyrus
said
gideon
spilett
here
is
a
very
secure
retreat
well
hid
in
the
depths
of
the
rock
but
it
is
however
uninhabitable
why
uninhabitable
asked
the
sailor
because
it
is
too
small
and
too
dark
couldnt
we
enlarge
it
hollow
it
out
make
openings
to
let
in
light
and
air
replied
pencroft
who
now
thought
nothing
impossible
let
us
go
on
with
our
exploration
said
cyrus
harding
perhaps
lower
down
nature
will
have
spared
us
this
labor
we
have
only
gone
a
third
of
the
way
observed
herbert
nearly
a
third
replied
harding
for
we
have
descended
a
hundred
feet
from
the
opening
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
a
hundred
feet
farther
down
where
is
top
asked
neb
interrupting
his
master
they
searched
the
cavern
but
the
dog
was
not
there
most
likely
he
has
gone
on
said
pencroft
let
us
join
him
replied
harding
the
descent
was
continued
the
engineer
carefully
observed
all
the
deviations
of
the
passage
and
notwithstanding
so
many
detours
he
could
easily
have
given
an
account
of
its
general
direction
which
went
towards
the
sea
the
settlers
had
gone
some
fifty
feet
farther
when
their
attention
was
attracted
by
distant
sounds
which
came
up
from
the
depths
they
stopped
and
listened
these
sounds
carried
through
the
passage
as
through
an
acoustic
tube
came
clearly
to
the
ear
that
is
top
barking
cried
herbert
yes
replied
pencroft
and
our
brave
dog
is
barking
furiously
we
have
our
irontipped
spears
said
cyrus
harding
keep
on
your
guard
and
forward
it
is
becoming
more
and
more
interesting
murmured
gideon
spilett
in
the
sailors
ear
who
nodded
harding
and
his
companions
rushed
to
the
help
of
their
dog
tops
barking
became
more
and
more
perceptible
and
it
seemed
strangely
fierce
was
he
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
some
animal
whose
retreat
he
had
disturbed
without
thinking
of
the
danger
to
which
they
might
be
exposed
the
explorers
were
now
impelled
by
an
irresistible
curiosity
and
in
a
few
minutes
sixteen
feet
lower
they
rejoined
top
there
the
passage
ended
in
a
vast
and
magnificent
cavern
top
was
running
backwards
and
forwards
barking
furiously
pencroft
and
neb
waving
their
torches
threw
the
light
into
every
crevice
and
at
the
same
time
harding
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
their
spears
raised
were
ready
for
any
emergency
which
might
arise
the
enormous
cavern
was
empty
the
settlers
explored
it
in
every
direction
there
was
nothing
there
not
an
animal
not
a
human
being
and
yet
top
continued
to
bark
neither
caresses
nor
threats
could
make
him
be
silent
there
must
be
a
place
somewhere
by
which
the
waters
of
the
lake
reached
the
sea
said
the
engineer
of
course
replied
pencroft
and
we
must
take
care
not
to
tumble
into
a
hole
go

cried
harding
the
dog
excited
by
his
masters
words
ran
towards
the
extremity
of
the
cavern
and
there
redoubled
his
barking
they
followed
him
and
by
the
light
of
the
torches
perceived
the
mouth
of
a
regular
well
in
the
granite
it
was
by
this
that
the
water
escaped
and
this
time
it
was
not
an
oblique
and
practicable
passage
but
a
perpendicular
well
into
which
it
was
impossible
to
venture
the
torches
were
held
over
the
opening
nothing
could
be
seen
harding
took
a
lighted
branch
and
threw
it
into
the
abyss
the
blazing
resin
whose
illuminating
power
increased
still
more
by
the
rapidity
of
its
fall
lighted
up
the
interior
of
the
well
but
yet
nothing
appeared
the
flame
then
went
out
with
a
slight
hiss
which
showed
that
it
had
reached
the
water
that
is
to
say
the
level
of
the
sea
the
engineer
calculating
the
time
employed
in
its
fall
was
able
to
calculate
the
depth
of
the
well
which
was
found
to
be
about
ninety
feet
the
floor
of
the
cavern
must
thus
be
situated
ninety
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
here
is
our
dwelling
said
cyrus
harding
but
it
was
occupied
by
some
creature
replied
gideon
spilett
whose
curiosity
was
not
yet
satisfied
well
the
creature
amphibious
or
otherwise
has
made
off
through
this
opening
replied
the
engineer
and
has
left
the
place
for
us
never
mind
added
the
sailor
i
should
like
very
much
to
be
top
just
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
he
doesnt
bark
for
nothing
cyrus
harding
looked
at
his
dog
and
those
of
his
companions
who
were
near
him
might
have
heard
him
murmur
these
words
yes
i
believe
that
top
knows
more
than
we
do
about
a
great
many
things
however
the
wishes
of
the
settlers
were
for
the
most
part
satisfied
chance
aided
by
the
marvelous
sagacity
of
their
leader
had
done
them
great
service
they
had
now
at
their
disposal
a
vast
cavern
the
size
of
which
could
not
be
properly
calculated
by
the
feeble
light
of
their
torches
but
it
would
certainly
be
easy
to
divide
it
into
rooms
by
means
of
brick
partitions
or
to
use
it
if
not
as
a
house
at
least
as
a
spacious
apartment
the
water
which
had
left
it
could
not
return
the
place
was
free
two
difficulties
remained
firstly
the
possibility
of
lighting
this
excavation
in
the
midst
of
solid
rock
secondly
the
necessity
of
rendering
the
means
of
access
more
easy
it
was
useless
to
think
of
lighting
it
from
above
because
of
the
enormous
thickness
of
the
granite
which
composed
the
ceiling
but
perhaps
the
outer
wall
next
the
sea
might
be
pierced
cyrus
harding
during
the
descent
had
roughly
calculated
its
obliqueness
and
consequently
the
length
of
the
passage
and
was
therefore
led
to
believe
that
the
outer
wall
could
not
be
very
thick
if
light
was
thus
obtained
so
would
a
means
of
access
for
it
would
be
as
easy
to
pierce
a
door
as
windows
and
to
establish
an
exterior
ladder
harding
made
known
his
ideas
to
his
companions
then
captain
let
us
set
to
work
replied
pencroft
i
have
my
pickaxe
and
i
shall
soon
make
my
way
through
this
wall
where
shall
i
strike
here
replied
the
engineer
showing
the
sturdy
sailor
a
considerable
recess
in
the
side
which
would
much
diminish
the
thickness
pencroft
attacked
the
granite
and
for
half
an
hour
by
the
light
of
the
torches
he
made
the
splinters
fly
around
him
neb
relieved
him
then
spilett
took
nebs
place
this
work
had
lasted
two
hours
and
they
began
to
fear
that
at
this
spot
the
wall
would
not
yield
to
the
pickaxe
when
at
a
last
blow
given
by
gideon
spilett
the
instrument
passing
through
the
rock
fell
outside
hurrah
hurrah
cried
pencroft
the
wall
only
measured
there
three
feet
in
thickness
harding
applied
his
eye
to
the
aperture
which
overlooked
the
ground
from
a
height
of
eighty
feet
before
him
was
extended
the
seacoast
the
islet
and
beyond
the
open
sea
floods
of
light
entered
by
this
hole
inundating
the
splendid
cavern
and
producing
a
magic
effect
on
its
left
side
it
did
not
measure
more
than
thirty
feet
in
height
and
breadth
but
on
the
right
it
was
enormous
and
its
vaulted
roof
rose
to
a
height
of
more
than
eighty
feet
in
some
places
granite
pillars
irregularly
disposed
supported
the
vaulted
roof
as
those
in
the
nave
of
a
cathedral
here
forming
lateral
piers
there
elliptical
arches
adorned
with
pointed
moldings
losing
themselves
in
dark
bays
amid
the
fantastic
arches
of
which
glimpses
could
be
caught
in
the
shade
covered
with
a
profusion
of
projections
formed
like
so
many
pendants
this
cavern
was
a
picturesque
mixture
of
all
the
styles
of
byzantine
roman
or
gothic
architecture
ever
produced
by
the
hand
of
man
and
yet
this
was
only
the
work
of
nature
she
alone
had
hollowed
this
fairy
alhambra
in
a
mass
of
granite
the
settlers
were
overwhelmed
with
admiration
where
they
had
only
expected
to
find
a
narrow
cavity
they
had
found
a
sort
of
marvelous
palace
and
neb
had
taken
off
his
hat
as
if
he
had
been
transported
into
a
temple
cries
of
admiration
issued
from
every
mouth
hurrahs
resounded
and
the
echo
was
repeated
again
and
again
till
it
died
away
in
the
dark
naves
ah
my
friends
exclaimed
cyrus
harding
when
we
have
lighted
the
interior
of
this
place
and
have
arranged
our
rooms
and
storehouses
in
the
left
part
we
shall
still
have
this
splendid
cavern
which
we
will
make
our
study
and
our
museum
and
we
will
call
it
asked
herbert
granite
house
replied
harding
a
name
which
his
companions
again
saluted
with
a
cheer
the
torches
were
now
almost
consumed
and
as
they
were
obliged
to
return
by
the
passage
to
reach
the
summit
of
the
plateau
it
was
decided
to
put
off
the
work
necessary
for
the
arrangement
of
their
new
dwelling
till
the
next
day
before
departing
cyrus
harding
leaned
once
more
over
the
dark
well
which
descended
perpendicularly
to
the
level
of
the
sea
he
listened
attentively
no
noise
was
heard
not
even
that
of
the
water
which
the
undulations
of
the
surge
must
sometimes
agitate
in
its
depths
a
flaming
branch
was
again
thrown
in
the
sides
of
the
well
were
lighted
up
for
an
instant
but
as
at
the
first
time
nothing
suspicious
was
seen
if
some
marine
monster
had
been
surprised
unawares
by
the
retreat
of
the
water
he
would
by
this
time
have
regained
the
sea
by
the
subterranean
passage
before
the
new
opening
had
been
offered
to
him
meanwhile
the
engineer
was
standing
motionless
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
gulf
without
uttering
a
word
the
sailor
approached
him
and
touching
his
arm
captain
said
he
what
do
you
want
my
friend
asked
the
engineer
as
if
he
had
returned
from
the
land
of
dreams
the
torches
will
soon
go
out
forward
replied
cyrus
harding
the
little
band
left
the
cavern
and
began
to
ascend
through
the
dark
passage
top
closed
the
rear
still
growling
every
now
and
then
the
ascent
was
painful
enough
the
settlers
rested
a
few
minutes
in
the
upper
grotto
which
made
a
sort
of
landingplace
halfway
up
the
long
granite
staircase
then
they
began
to
climb
again
soon
fresher
air
was
felt
the
drops
of
water
dried
by
evaporation
no
longer
sparkled
on
the
walls
the
flaring
torches
began
to
grow
dim
the
one
which
neb
carried
went
out
and
if
they
did
not
wish
to
find
their
way
in
the
dark
they
must
hasten
this
was
done
and
a
little
before
four
oclock
at
the
moment
when
the
sailors
torch
went
out
in
its
turn
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
passed
out
of
the
passage
chapter
19
the
next
day
the
22nd
of
may
the
arrangement
of
their
new
dwelling
was
commenced
in
fact
the
settlers
longed
to
exchange
the
insufficient
shelter
of
the
chimneys
for
this
large
and
healthy
retreat
in
the
midst
of
solid
rock
and
sheltered
from
the
water
both
of
the
sea
and
sky
their
former
dwelling
was
not
however
to
be
entirely
abandoned
for
the
engineer
intended
to
make
a
manufactory
of
it
for
important
works
cyrus
hardings
first
care
was
to
find
out
the
position
of
the
front
of
granite
house
from
the
outside
he
went
to
the
beach
and
as
the
pickaxe
when
it
escaped
from
the
hands
of
the
reporter
must
have
fallen
perpendicularly
to
the
foot
of
the
cliff
the
finding
it
would
be
sufficient
to
show
the
place
where
the
hole
had
been
pierced
in
the
granite
the
pickaxe
was
easily
found
and
the
hole
could
be
seen
in
a
perpendicular
line
above
the
spot
where
it
was
stuck
in
the
sand
some
rock
pigeons
were
already
flying
in
and
out
of
the
narrow
opening
they
evidently
thought
that
granite
house
had
been
discovered
on
purpose
for
them
it
was
the
engineers
intention
to
divide
the
right
portion
of
the
cavern
into
several
rooms
preceded
by
an
entrance
passage
and
to
light
it
by
means
of
five
windows
and
a
door
pierced
in
the
front
pencroft
was
much
pleased
with
the
five
windows
but
he
could
not
understand
the
use
of
the
door
since
the
passage
offered
a
natural
staircase
through
which
it
would
always
be
easy
to
enter
granite
house
my
friend
replied
harding
if
it
is
easy
for
us
to
reach
our
dwelling
by
this
passage
it
will
be
equally
easy
for
others
besides
us
i
mean
on
the
contrary
to
block
up
that
opening
to
seal
it
hermetically
and
if
it
is
necessary
to
completely
hide
the
entrance
by
making
a
dam
and
thus
causing
the
water
of
the
lake
to
rise
and
how
shall
we
get
in
asked
the
sailor
by
an
outside
ladder
replied
cyrus
harding
a
rope
ladder
which
once
drawn
up
will
render
access
to
our
dwelling
impossible
but
why
so
many
precautions
asked
pencroft
as
yet
we
have
seen
no
dangerous
animals
as
to
our
island
being
inhabited
by
natives
i
dont
believe
it
are
you
quite
sure
of
that
pencroft
asked
the
engineer
looking
at
the
sailor
of
course
we
shall
not
be
quite
sure
till
we
have
explored
it
in
every
direction
replied
pencroft
yes
said
harding
for
we
know
only
a
small
portion
of
it
as
yet
but
at
any
rate
if
we
have
no
enemies
in
the
interior
they
may
come
from
the
exterior
for
parts
of
the
pacific
are
very
dangerous
we
must
be
provided
against
every
contingency
cyrus
harding
spoke
wisely
and
without
making
any
further
objection
pencroft
prepared
to
execute
his
orders
the
front
of
granite
house
was
then
to
be
lighted
by
five
windows
and
a
door
besides
a
large
bay
window
and
some
smaller
oval
ones
which
would
admit
plenty
of
light
to
enter
into
the
marvelous
nave
which
was
to
be
their
chief
room
this
facade
situated
at
a
height
of
eighty
feet
above
the
ground
was
exposed
to
the
east
and
the
rising
sun
saluted
it
with
its
first
rays
it
was
found
to
be
just
at
that
part
of
the
cliff
which
was
between
the
projection
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
and
a
perpendicular
line
traced
above
the
heap
of
rocks
which
formed
the
chimneys
thus
the
winds
from
the
northeast
would
only
strike
it
obliquely
for
it
was
protected
by
the
projection
besides
until
the
windowframes
were
made
the
engineer
meant
to
close
the
openings
with
thick
shutters
which
would
prevent
either
wind
or
rain
from
entering
and
which
could
be
concealed
in
need
the
first
work
was
to
make
the
openings
this
would
have
taken
too
long
with
the
pickaxe
alone
and
it
is
known
that
harding
was
an
ingenious
man
he
had
still
a
quantity
of
nitroglycerine
at
his
disposal
and
he
employed
it
usefully
by
means
of
this
explosive
substance
the
rock
was
broken
open
at
the
very
places
chosen
by
the
engineer
then
with
the
pickaxe
and
spade
the
windows
and
doors
were
properly
shaped
the
jagged
edges
were
smoothed
off
and
a
few
days
after
the
beginning
of
the
work
granite
house
was
abundantly
lighted
by
the
rising
sun
whose
rays
penetrated
into
its
most
secret
recesses
following
the
plan
proposed
by
cyrus
harding
the
space
was
to
be
divided
into
five
compartments
looking
out
on
the
sea
to
the
right
an
entry
with
a
door
which
would
meet
the
ladder
then
a
kitchen
thirty
feet
long
a
diningroom
measuring
forty
feet
a
sleepingroom
of
equal
size
and
lastly
a
visitors
room
petitioned
for
by
pencroft
and
which
was
next
to
the
great
hall
these
rooms
or
rather
this
suite
of
rooms
would
not
occupy
all
the
depth
of
the
cave
there
would
be
also
a
corridor
and
a
storehouse
in
which
their
tools
provisions
and
stores
would
be
kept
all
the
productions
of
the
island
the
flora
as
well
as
the
fauna
were
to
be
there
in
the
best
possible
state
of
preservation
and
completely
sheltered
from
the
damp
there
was
no
want
of
space
so
that
each
object
could
be
methodically
arranged
besides
the
colonists
had
still
at
their
disposal
the
little
grotto
above
the
great
cavern
which
was
like
the
garret
of
the
new
dwelling
this
plan
settled
it
had
only
to
be
put
into
execution
the
miners
became
brickmakers
again
then
the
bricks
were
brought
to
the
foot
of
granite
house
till
then
harding
and
his
companions
had
only
entered
the
cavern
by
the
long
passage
this
mode
of
communication
obliged
them
first
to
climb
prospect
heights
making
a
detour
by
the
rivers
bank
and
then
to
descend
two
hundred
feet
through
the
passage
having
to
climb
as
far
when
they
wished
to
return
to
the
plateau
this
was
a
great
loss
of
time
and
was
also
very
fatiguing
cyrus
harding
therefore
resolved
to
proceed
without
any
further
delay
to
the
fabrication
of
a
strong
rope
ladder
which
once
raised
would
render
granite
house
completely
inaccessible
this
ladder
was
manufactured
with
extreme
care
and
its
uprights
formed
of
the
twisted
fibers
of
a
species
of
cane
had
the
strength
of
a
thick
cable
as
to
the
rounds
they
were
made
of
a
sort
of
red
cedar
with
light
strong
branches
and
this
apparatus
was
wrought
by
the
masterly
hand
of
pencroft
other
ropes
were
made
with
vegetable
fibers
and
a
sort
of
crane
with
a
tackle
was
fixed
at
the
door
in
this
way
bricks
could
easily
be
raised
into
granite
house
the
transport
of
the
materials
being
thus
simplified
the
arrangement
of
the
interior
could
begin
immediately
there
was
no
want
of
lime
and
some
thousands
of
bricks
were
there
ready
to
be
used
the
framework
of
the
partitions
was
soon
raised
very
roughly
at
first
and
in
a
short
time
the
cave
was
divided
into
rooms
and
storehouses
according
to
the
plan
agreed
upon
these
different
works
progressed
rapidly
under
the
direction
of
the
engineer
who
himself
handled
the
hammer
and
the
trowel
no
labor
came
amiss
to
cyrus
harding
who
thus
set
an
example
to
his
intelligent
and
zealous
companions
they
worked
with
confidence
even
gaily
pencroft
always
having
some
joke
to
crack
sometimes
carpenter
sometimes
ropemaker
sometimes
mason
while
he
communicated
his
good
humor
to
all
the
members
of
their
little
world
his
faith
in
the
engineer
was
complete
nothing
could
disturb
it
he
believed
him
capable
of
undertaking
anything
and
succeeding
in
everything
the
question
of
boots
and
clothesassuredly
a
serious
questionthat
of
light
during
the
winter
months
utilizing
the
fertile
parts
of
the
island
transforming
the
wild
flora
into
cultivated
flora
it
all
appeared
easy
to
him
cyrus
harding
helping
everything
would
be
done
in
time
he
dreamed
of
canals
facilitating
the
transport
of
the
riches
of
the
ground
workings
of
quarries
and
mines
machines
for
every
industrial
manufacture
railroads
yes
railroads
of
which
a
network
would
certainly
one
day
cover
lincoln
island
the
engineer
let
pencroft
talk
he
did
not
put
down
the
aspirations
of
this
brave
heart
he
knew
how
communicable
confidence
is
he
even
smiled
to
hear
him
speak
and
said
nothing
of
the
uneasiness
for
the
future
which
he
felt
in
fact
in
that
part
of
the
pacific
out
of
the
course
of
vessels
it
was
to
be
feared
that
no
help
would
ever
come
to
them
it
was
on
themselves
on
themselves
alone
that
the
settlers
must
depend
for
the
distance
of
lincoln
island
from
all
other
land
was
such
that
to
hazard
themselves
in
a
boat
of
a
necessarily
inferior
construction
would
be
a
serious
and
perilous
thing
but
as
the
sailor
said
they
quite
took
the
wind
out
of
the
sails
of
the
robinsons
for
whom
everything
was
done
by
a
miracle
in
fact
they
were
energetic
an
energetic
man
will
succeed
where
an
indolent
one
would
vegetate
and
inevitably
perish
herbert
distinguished
himself
in
these
works
he
was
intelligent
and
active
understanding
quickly
he
performed
well
and
cyrus
harding
became
more
and
more
attached
to
the
boy
herbert
had
a
lively
and
reverent
love
for
the
engineer
pencroft
saw
the
close
sympathy
which
existed
between
the
two
but
he
was
not
in
the
least
jealous
neb
was
neb
he
was
what
he
would
be
always
courage
zeal
devotion
selfdenial
personified
he
had
the
same
faith
in
his
master
that
pencroft
had
but
he
showed
it
less
vehemently
when
the
sailor
was
enthusiastic
neb
always
looked
as
if
he
would
say
nothing
could
be
more
natural
pencroft
and
he
were
great
friends
as
to
gideon
spilett
he
took
part
in
the
common
work
and
was
not
less
skilful
in
it
than
his
companions
which
always
rather
astonished
the
sailor
a
journalist
clever
not
only
in
understanding
but
in
performing
everything
the
ladder
was
finally
fixed
on
the
28th
of
may
there
were
not
less
than
a
hundred
rounds
in
this
perpendicular
height
of
eighty
feet
harding
had
been
able
fortunately
to
divide
it
in
two
parts
profiting
by
an
overhanging
of
the
cliff
which
made
a
projection
forty
feet
above
the
ground
this
projection
carefully
leveled
by
the
pickaxe
made
a
sort
of
platform
to
which
they
fixed
the
first
ladder
of
which
the
oscillation
was
thus
diminished
onehalf
and
a
rope
permitted
it
to
be
raised
to
the
level
of
granite
house
as
to
the
second
ladder
it
was
secured
both
at
its
lower
part
which
rested
on
the
projection
and
at
its
upper
end
which
was
fastened
to
the
door
in
short
the
ascent
had
been
made
much
easier
besides
cyrus
harding
hoped
later
to
establish
an
hydraulic
apparatus
which
would
avoid
all
fatigue
and
loss
of
time
for
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
the
settlers
soon
became
habituated
to
the
use
of
this
ladder
they
were
light
and
active
and
pencroft
as
a
sailor
accustomed
to
run
up
the
masts
and
shrouds
was
able
to
give
them
lessons
but
it
was
also
necessary
to
give
them
to
top
the
poor
dog
with
his
four
paws
was
not
formed
for
this
sort
of
exercise
but
pencroft
was
such
a
zealous
master
that
top
ended
by
properly
performing
his
ascents
and
soon
mounted
the
ladder
as
readily
as
his
brethren
in
the
circus
it
need
not
be
said
that
the
sailor
was
proud
of
his
pupil
however
more
than
once
pencroft
hoisted
him
on
his
back
which
top
never
complained
of
it
must
be
mentioned
here
that
during
these
works
which
were
actively
conducted
for
the
bad
season
was
approaching
the
alimentary
question
was
not
neglected
every
day
the
reporter
and
herbert
who
had
been
voted
purveyors
to
the
colony
devoted
some
hours
to
the
chase
as
yet
they
only
hunted
in
jacamar
wood
on
the
left
of
the
river
because
for
want
of
a
bridge
or
boat
the
mercy
had
not
yet
been
crossed
all
the
immense
woods
to
which
the
name
of
the
forests
of
the
far
west
had
been
given
were
not
explored
they
reserved
this
important
excursion
for
the
first
fine
days
of
the
next
spring
but
jacamar
wood
was
full
of
game
kangaroos
and
boars
abounded
and
the
hunters
irontipped
spears
and
bows
and
arrows
did
wonders
besides
herbert
discovered
towards
the
southwest
point
of
the
lagoon
a
natural
warren
a
slightly
damp
meadow
covered
with
willows
and
aromatic
herbs
which
scented
the
air
such
as
thyme
basil
savory
all
the
sweetscented
species
of
the
labiated
plants
which
the
rabbits
appeared
to
be
particularly
fond
of
on
the
reporter
observing
that
since
the
table
was
spread
for
the
rabbits
it
was
strange
that
the
rabbits
themselves
should
be
wanting
the
two
sportsmen
carefully
explored
the
warren
at
any
rate
it
produced
an
abundance
of
useful
plants
and
a
naturalist
would
have
had
a
good
opportunity
of
studying
many
specimens
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
herbert
gathered
several
shoots
of
the
basil
rosemary
balm
betony
etc
which
possess
different
medicinal
properties
some
pectoral
astringent
febrifuge
others
antispasmodic
or
antirheumatic
when
afterwards
pencroft
asked
the
use
of
this
collection
of
herbs
for
medicine
replied
the
lad
to
treat
us
when
we
are
ill
why
should
we
be
ill
since
there
are
no
doctors
in
the
island
asked
pencroft
quite
seriously
there
was
no
reply
to
be
made
to
that
but
the
lad
went
on
with
his
collection
all
the
same
and
it
was
well
received
at
granite
house
besides
these
medicinal
herbs
he
added
a
plant
known
in
north
america
as
oswego
tea
which
made
an
excellent
beverage
at
last
by
searching
thoroughly
the
hunters
arrived
at
the
real
site
of
the
warren
there
the
ground
was
perforated
like
a
sieve
here
are
the
burrows
cried
herbert
yes
replied
the
reporter
so
i
see
but
are
they
inhabited
that
is
the
question
this
was
soon
answered
almost
immediately
hundreds
of
little
animals
similar
to
rabbits
fled
in
every
direction
with
such
rapidity
that
even
top
could
not
overtake
them
hunters
and
dog
ran
in
vain
these
rodents
escaped
them
easily
but
the
reporter
resolved
not
to
leave
the
place
until
he
had
captured
at
least
halfadozen
of
the
quadrupeds
he
wished
to
stock
their
larder
first
and
domesticate
those
which
they
might
take
later
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
do
this
with
a
few
snares
stretched
at
the
openings
of
the
burrows
but
at
this
moment
they
had
neither
snares
nor
anything
to
make
them
of
they
must
therefore
be
satisfied
with
visiting
each
hole
and
rummaging
in
it
with
a
stick
hoping
by
dint
of
patience
to
do
what
could
not
be
done
in
any
other
way
at
last
after
half
an
hour
four
rodents
were
taken
in
their
holes
they
were
similar
to
their
european
brethren
and
are
commonly
known
by
the
name
of
american
rabbits
this
produce
of
the
chase
was
brought
back
to
granite
house
and
figured
at
the
evening
repast
the
tenants
of
the
warren
were
not
at
all
to
be
despised
for
they
were
delicious
it
was
a
valuable
resource
of
the
colony
and
it
appeared
to
be
inexhaustible
on
the
31st
of
may
the
partitions
were
finished
the
rooms
had
now
only
to
be
furnished
and
this
would
be
work
for
the
long
winter
days
a
chimney
was
established
in
the
first
room
which
served
as
a
kitchen
the
pipe
destined
to
conduct
the
smoke
outside
gave
some
trouble
to
these
amateur
bricklayers
it
appeared
simplest
to
harding
to
make
it
of
brick
clay
as
creating
an
outlet
for
it
to
the
upper
plateau
was
not
to
be
thought
of
a
hole
was
pierced
in
the
granite
above
the
window
of
the
kitchen
and
the
pipe
met
it
like
that
of
an
iron
stove
perhaps
the
winds
which
blew
directly
against
the
facade
would
make
the
chimney
smoke
but
these
winds
were
rare
and
besides
master
neb
the
cook
was
not
so
very
particular
about
that
when
these
interior
arrangements
were
finished
the
engineer
occupied
himself
in
blocking
up
the
outlet
by
the
lake
so
as
to
prevent
any
access
by
that
way
masses
of
rock
were
rolled
to
the
entrance
and
strongly
cemented
together
cyrus
harding
did
not
yet
realize
his
plan
of
drowning
this
opening
under
the
waters
of
the

by
restoring
them
to
their
former
level
by
means
of
a
dam
he
contented
himself
with
hiding
the
obstruction
with
grass
and
shrubs
which
were
planted
in
the
interstices
of
the
rocks
and
which
next
spring
would
sprout
thickly
however
he
used
the
waterfall
so
as
to
lead
a
small
stream
of
fresh
water
to
the
new
dwelling
a
little
trench
made
below
their
level
produced
this
result
and
this
derivation
from
a
pure
and
inexhaustible
source
yielded
twentyfive
or
thirty
gallons
a
day
there
would
never
be
any
want
of
water
at
granite
house
at
last
all
was
finished
and
it
was
time
for
the
bad
season
was
near
thick
shutters
closed
the
windows
of
the
facade
until
the
engineer
had
time
to
make
glass
gideon
spilett
had
very
artistically
arranged
on
the
rocky
projections
around
the
windows
plants
of
different
kinds
as
well
as
long
streaming
grass
so
that
the
openings
were
picturesquely
framed
in
green
which
had
a
pleasing
effect
the
inhabitants
of
this
solid
healthy
and
secure
dwelling
could
not
but
be
charmed
with
their
work
the
view
from
the
windows
extended
over
a
boundless
horizon
which
was
closed
by
the
two
mandible

on
the

was
spread
before
them
yes
our
brave
settlers
had
reason
to
be
satisfied
and
pencroft
was
lavish
in
his
praise
of
what
he
humorously
called
his
apartments
on
the

chapter
20
the
winter
season
set
in
with
the
month
of
june
which
corresponds
with
the
month
of
december
in
the
northern
hemisphere
it
began
with
showers
and
squalls
which
succeeded
each
other
without
intermission
the
tenants
of
granite
house
could
appreciate
the
advantages
of
a
dwelling
which
sheltered
them
from
the
inclement
weather
the
chimneys
would
have
been
quite
insufficient
to
protect
them
against
the
rigor
of
winter
and
it
was
to
be
feared
that
the
high
tides
would
make
another
irruption
cyrus
harding
had
taken
precautions
against
this
contingency
so
as
to
preserve
as
much
as
possible
the
forge
and
furnace
which
were
established
there
during
the
whole
of
the
month
of
june
the
time
was
employed
in
different
occupations
which
excluded
neither
hunting
nor
fishing
the
larder
being
therefore
abundantly
supplied
pencroft
so
soon
as
he
had
leisure
proposed
to
set
some
traps
from
which
he
expected
great
results
he
soon
made
some
snares
with
creepers
by
the
aid
of
which
the
warren
henceforth
every
day
furnished
its
quota
of
rodents
neb
employed
nearly
all
his
time
in
salting
or
smoking
meat
which
insured
their
always
having
plenty
of
provisions
the
question
of
clothes
was
now
seriously
discussed
the
settlers
having
no
other
garments
than
those
they
wore
when
the
balloon
threw
them
on
the
island
these
clothes
were
warm
and
good
they
had
taken
great
care
of
them
as
well
as
of
their
linen
and
they
were
perfectly
whole
but
they
would
soon
need
to
be
replaced
moreover
if
the
winter
was
severe
the
settlers
would
suffer
greatly
from
cold
on
this
subject
the
ingenuity
of
harding
was
at
fault
they
must
provide
for
their
most
pressing
wants
settle
their
dwelling
and
lay
in
a
store
of
food
thus
the
cold
might
come
upon
them
before
the
question
of
clothes
had
been
settled
they
must
therefore
make
up
their
minds
to
pass
this
first
winter
without
additional
clothing
when
the
fine
season
came
round
again
they
would
regularly
hunt
those
musmons
which
had
been
seen
on
the
expedition
to
mount
franklin
and
the
wool
once
collected
the
engineer
would
know
how
to
make
it
into
strong
warm
stuff
how
he
would
consider
well
we
are
free
to
roast
ourselves
at
granite
house
said
pencroft
there
are
heaps
of
fuel
and
no
reason
for
sparing
it
besides
added
gideon
spilett
lincoln
island
is
not
situated
under
a
very
high
latitude
and
probably
the
winters
here
are
not
severe
did
you
not
say
cyrus
that
this
thirtyfifth
parallel
corresponded
to
that
of
spain
in
the
other
hemisphere
doubtless
replied
the
engineer
but
some
winters
in
spain
are
very
cold
no
want
of
snow
and
ice
and
perhaps
lincoln
island
is
just
as
rigorously
tried
however
it
is
an
island
and
as
such
i
hope
that
the
temperature
will
be
more
moderate
why
captain
asked
herbert
because
the
sea
my
boy
may
be
considered
as
an
immense
reservoir
in
which
is
stored
the
heat
of
the
summer
when
winter
comes
it
restores
this
heat
which
insures
for
the
regions
near
the
ocean
a
medium
temperature
less
high
in
summer
but
less
low
in
winter
we
shall
prove
that
replied
pencroft
but
i
dont
want
to
bother
myself
about
whether
it
will
be
cold
or
not
one
thing
is
certain
that
is
that
the
days
are
already
short
and
the
evenings
long
suppose
we
talk
about
the
question
of
light
nothing
is
easier
replied
harding
to
talk
about
asked
the
sailor
to
settle
and
when
shall
we
begin
tomorrow
by
having
a
seal
hunt
to
make
candles
yes
such
was
the
engineers
project
and
it
was
quite
feasible
since
he
had
lime
and
sulphuric
acid
while
the
amphibians
of
the
islet
would
furnish
the
fat
necessary
for
the
manufacture
they
were
now
at
the
4th
of
june
it
was
whit
sunday
and
they
agreed
to
observe
this
feast
all
work
was
suspended
and
prayers
were
offered
to
heaven
but
these
prayers
were
now
thanksgivings
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
were
no
longer
the
miserable
castaways
thrown
on
the
islet
they
asked
for
nothing
morethey
gave
thanks
the
next
day
the
5th
of
june
in
rather
uncertain
weather
they
set
out
for
the
islet
they
had
to
profit
by
the
low
tide
to
cross
the
channel
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
would
construct
for
this
purpose
as
well
as
they
could
a
boat
which
would
render
communication
so
much
easier
and
would
also
permit
them
to
ascend
the
mercy
at
the
time
of
their
grand
exploration
of
the
southwest
of
the
island
which
was
put
off
till
the
first
fine
days
the
seals
were
numerous
and
the
hunters
armed
with
their
irontipped
spears
easily
killed
halfadozen
neb
and
pencroft
skinned
them
and
only
brought
back
to
granite
house
their
fat
and
skin
this
skin
being
intended
for
the
manufacture
of
boots
the
result
of
the
hunt
was
this
nearly
three
hundred
pounds
of
fat
all
to
be
employed
in
the
fabrication
of
candles
the
operation
was
extremely
simple
and
if
it
did
not
yield
absolutely
perfect
results
they
were
at
least
very
useful
cyrus
harding
would
only
have
had
at
his
disposal
sulphuric
acid
but
by
heating
this
acid
with
the
neutral
fatty
bodies
he
could
separate
the
glycerine
then
from
this
new
combination
he
easily
separated
the
olein
the
margarin
and
the
stearin
by
employing
boiling
water
but
to
simplify
the
operation
he
preferred
to
saponify
the
fat
by
means
of
lime
by
this
he
obtained
a
calcareous
soap
easy
to
decompose
by
sulphuric
acid
which
precipitated
the
lime
into
the
state
of
sulphate
and
liberated
the
fatty
acids
from
these
three
acidsoleic
margaric
and
stearicthe
first
being
liquid
was
driven
out
by
a
sufficient
pressure
as
to
the
two
others
they
formed
the
very
substance
of
which
the
candles
were
to
be
molded
this
operation
did
not
last
more
than
four
and
twenty
hours
the
wicks
after
several
trials
were
made
of
vegetable
fibers
and
dipped
in
the
liquefied
substance
they
formed
regular
stearic
candles
molded
by
the
hand
which
only
wanted
whiteness
and
polish
they
would
not
doubtless
have
the
advantages
of
the
wicks
which
are
impregnated
with
boracic
acid
and
which
vitrify
as
they
burn
and
are
entirely
consumed
but
cyrus
harding
having
manufactured
a
beautiful
pair
of
snuffers
these
candles
would
be
greatly
appreciated
during
the
long
evenings
in
granite
house
during
this
month
there
was
no
want
of
work
in
the
interior
of
their
new
dwelling
the
joiners
had
plenty
to
do
they
improved
their
tools
which
were
very
rough
and
added
others
also
scissors
were
made
among
other
things
and
the
settlers
were
at
last
able
to
cut
their
hair
and
also
to
shave
or
at
least
trim
their
beards
herbert
had
none
neb
but
little
but
their
companions
were
bristling
in
a
way
which
justified
the
making
of
the
said
scissors
the
manufacture
of
a
handsaw
cost
infinite
trouble
but
at
last
an
instrument
was
obtained
which
when
vigorously
handled
could
divide
the
ligneous
fibers
of
the
wood
they
then
made
tables
seats
cupboards
to
furnish
the
principal
rooms
and
bedsteads
of
which
all
the
bedding
consisted
of
grass
mattresses
the
kitchen
with
its
shelves
on
which
rested
the
cooking
utensils
its
brick
stove
looked
very
well
and
neb
worked
away
there
as
earnestly
as
if
he
was
in
a
chemists
laboratory
but
the
joiners
had
soon
to
be
replaced
by
carpenters
in
fact
the
waterfall
created
by
the
explosion
rendered
the
construction
of
two
bridges
necessary
one
on
prospect
heights
the
other
on
the
shore
now
the
plateau
and
the
shore
were
transversely
divided
by
a
watercourse
which
had
to
be
crossed
to
reach
the
northern
part
of
the
island
to
avoid
it
the
colonists
had
been
obliged
to
make
a
considerable
detour
by
climbing
up
to
the
source
of
the
red
creek
the
simplest
thing
was
to
establish
on
the
plateau
and
on
the
shore
two
bridges
from
twenty
to
five
and
twenty
feet
in
length
all
the
carpenters
work
that
was
needed
was
to
clear
some
trees
of
their
branches
this
was
a
business
of
some
days
directly
the
bridges
were
established
neb
and
pencroft
profited
by
them
to
go
to
the
oysterbed
which
had
been
discovered
near
the
downs
they
dragged
with
them
a
sort
of
rough
cart
which
replaced
the
former
inconvenient
hurdle
and
brought
back
some
thousands
of
oysters
which
soon
increased
among
the
rocks
and
formed
a
bed
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
these
molluscs
were
of
excellent
quality
and
the
colonists
consumed
some
daily
it
has
been
seen
that
lincoln
island
although
its
inhabitants
had
as
yet
only
explored
a
small
portion
of
it
already
contributed
to
almost
all
their
wants
it
was
probable
that
if
they
hunted
into
its
most
secret
recesses
in
all
the
wooded
part
between
the
mercy
and
reptile
point
they
would
find
new
treasures
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
had
still
one
privation
there
was
no
want
of
meat
nor
of
vegetable
products
those
ligneous
roots
which
they
had
found
when
subjected
to
fermentation
gave
them
an
acid
drink
which
was
preferable
to
cold
water
they
also
made
sugar
without
canes
or
beetroots
by
collecting
the
liquor
which
distils
from
the
acer
saceharinum
a
sort
of
mapletree
which
flourishes
in
all
the
temperate
zones
and
of
which
the
island
possessed
a
great
number
they
made
a
very
agreeable
tea
by
employing
the
herbs
brought
from
the
warren
lastly
they
had
an
abundance
of
salt
the
only
mineral
which
is
used
in
food
but
bread
was
wanting
perhaps
in
time
the
settlers
could
replace
this
want
by
some
equivalent
it
was
possible
that
they
might
find
the
sago
or
the
breadfruit
tree
among
the
forests
of
the
south
but
they
had
not
as
yet
met
with
these
precious
trees
however
providence
came
directly
to
their
aid
in
an
infinitesimal
proportion
it
is
true
but
cyrus
harding
with
all
his
intelligence
all
his
ingenuity
would
never
have
been
able
to
produce
that
which
by
the
greatest
chance
herbert
one
day
found
in
the
lining
of
his
waistcoat
which
he
was
occupied
in
setting
to
rights
on
this
day
as
it
was
raining
in
torrents
the
settlers
were
assembled
in
the
great
hall
in
granite
house
when
the
lad
cried
out
all
at
once
look
here
captaina
grain
of
corn
and
he
showed
his
companions
a
graina
single
grainwhich
from
a
hole
in
his
pocket
had
got
into
the
lining
of
his
waistcoat
the
presence
of
this
grain
was
explained
by
the
fact
that
herbert
when
at
richmond
used
to
feed
some
pigeons
of
which
pencroft
had
made
him
a
present
a
grain
of
corn
said
the
engineer
quickly
yes
captain
but
one
only
one
well
my
boy
said
pencroft
laughing
were
getting
on
capitally
upon
my
word
what
shall
we
make
with
one
grain
of
corn
we
will
make
bread
of
it
replied
cyrus
harding
bread
cakes
tarts
replied
the
sailor
come
the
bread
that
this
grain
of
corn
will
make
wont
choke
us
very
soon
herbert
not
attaching
much
importance
to
his
discovery
was
going
to
throw
away
the
grain
in
question
but
harding
took
it
examined
it
found
that
it
was
in
good
condition
and
looking
the
sailor
full
in
the
facepencroft
he
asked
quietly
do
you
know
how
many
ears
one
grain
of
corn
can
produce
one
i
suppose
replied
the
sailor
surprised
at
the
question
ten
pencroft
and
do
you
know
how
many
grains
one
ear
bears
no
upon
my
word
about
eighty
said
cyrus
harding
then
if
we
plant
this
grain
at
the
first
crop
we
shall
reap
eight
hundred
grains
which
at
the
second
will
produce
six
hundred
and
forty
thousand
at
the
third
five
hundred
and
twelve
millions
at
the
fourth
more
than
four
hundred
thousands
of
millions
there
is
the
proportion
hardings
companions
listened
without
answering
these
numbers
astonished
them
they
were
exact
however
yes
my
friends
continued
the
engineer
such
are
the
arithmetical
progressions
of
prolific
nature
and
yet
what
is
this
multiplication
of
the
grain
of
corn
of
which
the
ear
only
bears
eight
hundred
grains
compared
to
the
poppyplant
which
bears
thirtytwo
thousand
seeds
to
the
tobaccoplant
which
produces
three
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
in
a
few
years
without
the
numerous
causes
of
destruction
which
arrests
their
fecundity
these
plants
would
overrun
the
earth
but
the
engineer
had
not
finished
his
lecture
and
now
pencroft
he
continued
do
you
know
how
many
bushels
four
hundred
thousand
millions
of
grains
would
make
no
replied
the
sailor
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
i
am
nothing
better
than
a
fool
well
they
would
make
more
than
three
millions
at
a
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
a
bushel
pencroft
three
millions
cried
pencroft
three
millions
in
four
years
in
four
years
replied
cyrus
harding
and
even
in
two
years
if
as
i
hope
in
this
latitude
we
can
obtain
two
crops
a
year
at
that
according
to
his
usual
custom
pencroft
could
not
reply
otherwise
than
by
a
tremendous
hurrah
so
herbert
added
the
engineer
you
have
made
a
discovery
of
great
importance
to
us
everything
my
friends
everything
can
serve
us
in
the
condition
in
which
we
are
do
not
forget
that
i
beg
of
you
no
captain
no
we
shant
forget
it
replied
pencroft
and
if
ever
i
find
one
of
those
tobaccoseeds
which
multiply
by
three
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
i
assure
you
i
wont
throw
it
away
and
now
what
must
we
do
we
must
plant
this
grain
replied
herbert
yes
added
gideon
spilett
and
with
every
possible
care
for
it
bears
in
itself
our
future
harvests
provided
it
grows
cried
the
sailor
it
will
grow
replied
cyrus
harding
this
was
the
20th
of
june
the
time
was
then
propitious
for
sowing
this
single
precious
grain
of
corn
it
was
first
proposed
to
plant
it
in
a
pot
but
upon
reflection
it
was
decided
to
leave
it
to
nature
and
confide
it
to
the
earth
this
was
done
that
very
day
and
it
is
needless
to
add
that
every
precaution
was
taken
that
the
experiment
might
succeed
the
weather
having
cleared
the
settlers
climbed
the
height
above
granite
house
there
on
the
plateau
they
chose
a
spot
well
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
exposed
to
all
the
heat
of
the
midday
sun
the
place
was
cleared
carefully
weeded
and
searched
for
insects
and
worms
then
a
bed
of
good
earth
improved
with
a
little
lime
was
made
it
was
surrounded
by
a
railing
and
the
grain
was
buried
in
the
damp
earth
did
it
not
seem
as
if
the
settlers
were
laying
the
first
stone
of
some
edifice
it
recalled
to
pencroft
the
day
on
which
he
lighted
his
only
match
and
all
the
anxiety
of
the
operation
but
this
time
the
thing
was
more
serious
in
fact
the
castaways
would
have
been
always
able
to
procure
fire
in
some
mode
or
other
but
no
human
power
could
supply
another
grain
of
corn
if
unfortunately
this
should
be
lost
chapter
21
from
this
time
pencroft
did
not
let
a
single
day
pass
without
going
to
visit
what
he
gravely
called
his
cornfield
and
woe
to
the
insects
which
dared
to
venture
there
no
mercy
was
shown
them
towards
the
end
of
the
month
of
june
after
incessant
rain
the
weather
became
decidedly
colder
and
on
the
29th
a
fahrenheit
thermometer
would
certainly
have
announced
only
twenty
degrees
above
zero
that
is
considerably
below
the
freezingpoint
the
next
day
the
30th
of
june
the
day
which
corresponds
to
the
31st
of
december
in
the
northern
year
was
a
friday
neb
remarked
that
the
year
finished
on
a
bad
day
but
pencroft
replied
that
naturally
the
next
would
begin
on
a
good
one
which
was
better
at
any
rate
it
commenced
by
very
severe
cold
ice
accumulated
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
whole
expanse
of
the
lake
was
frozen
the
settlers
had
frequently
been
obliged
to
renew
their
store
of
wood
pencroft
also
had
wisely
not
waited
till
the
river
was
frozen
but
had
brought
enormous
rafts
of
wood
to
their
destination
the
current
was
an
indefatigable
moving
power
and
it
was
employed
in
conveying
the
floating
wood
to
the
moment
when
the
frost
enchained
it
to
the
fuel
which
was
so
abundantly
supplied
by
the
forest
they
added
several
cartloads
of
coal
which
had
to
be
brought
from
the
foot
of
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
the
powerful
heat
of
the
coal
was
greatly
appreciated
in
the
low
temperature
which
on
the
4th
of
july
fell
to
eight
degrees
of
fahrenheit
that
is
thirteen
degrees
below
zero
a
second
fireplace
had
been
established
in
the
diningroom
where
they
all
worked
together
at
their
different
avocations
during
this
period
of
cold
cyrus
harding
had
great
cause
to
congratulate
himself
on
having
brought
to
granite
house
the
little
stream
of
water
from
lake
grant
taken
below
the
frozen
surface
and
conducted
through
the
passage
it
preserved
its
fluidity
and
arrived
at
an
interior
reservoir
which
had
been
hollowed
out
at
the
back
part
of
the
storeroom
while
the
overflow
ran
through
the
well
to
the
sea
about
this
time
the
weather
being
extremely
dry
the
colonists
clothed
as
warmly
as
possible
resolved
to
devote
a
day
to
the
exploration
of
that
part
of
the
island
between
the
mercy
and
claw
cape
it
was
a
wide
extent
of
marshy
land
and
they
would
probably
find
good
sport
for
waterbirds
ought
to
swarm
there
they
reckoned
that
it
would
be
about
eight
or
nine
miles
to
go
there
and
as
much
to
return
so
that
the
whole
of
the
day
would
be
occupied
as
an
unknown
part
of
the
island
was
about
to
be
explored
the
whole
colony
took
part
in
the
expedition
accordingly
on
the
5th
of
july
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
when
day
had
scarcely
broken
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
herbert
neb
and
pencroft
armed
with
spears
snares
bows
and
arrows
and
provided
with
provisions
left
granite
house
preceded
by
top
who
bounded
before
them
their
shortest
way
was
to
cross
the
mercy
on
the
ice
which
then
covered
it
but
as
the
engineer
justly
observed
that
could
not
take
the
place
of
a
regular
bridge
so
the
construction
of
a
regular
bridge
was
noted
in
the
list
of
future
works
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
settlers
had
set
foot
on
the
right
bank
of
the
mercy
and
ventured
into
the
midst
of
those
gigantic
and
superb
coniferae
now
sprinkled
over
with
snow
but
they
had
not
gone
half
a
mile
when
from
a
thicket
a
whole
family
of
quadrupeds
who
had
made
a
home
there
disturbed
by
top
rushed
forth
into
the
open
country
ah
i
should
say
those
are
foxes
cried
herbert
when
he
saw
the
troop
rapidly
decamping
they
were
foxes
but
of
a
very
large
size
who
uttered
a
sort
of
barking
at
which
top
seemed
to
be
very
much
astonished
for
he
stopped
short
in
the
chase
and
gave
the
swift
animals
time
to
disappear
the
dog
had
reason
to
be
surprised
as
he
did
not
know
natural
history
but
by
their
barking
these
foxes
with
reddishgray
hair
black
tails
terminating
in
a
white
tuft
had
betrayed
their
origin
so
herbert
was
able
without
hesitating
to
give
them
their
real
name
of
arctic
foxes
they
are
frequently
met
with
in
chile
in
the
falkland
islands
and
in
all
parts
of
america
traversed
by
the
thirtieth
and
fortieth
parallels
herbert
much
regretted
that
top
had
not
been
able
to
catch
one
of
these
carnivora
are
they
good
to
eat
asked
pencroft
who
only
regarded
the
representatives
of
the
fauna
in
the
island
from
one
special
point
of
view
no
replied
herbert
but
zoologists
have
not
yet
found
out
if
the
eye
of
these
foxes
is
diurnal
or
nocturnal
or
whether
it
is
correct
to
class
them
in
the
genus
dog
properly
so
called
harding
could
not
help
smiling
on
hearing
the
lads
reflection
which
showed
a
thoughtful
mind
as
to
the
sailor
from
the
moment
when
he
found
that
the
foxes
were
not
classed
in
the
genus
eatable
they
were
nothing
to
him
however
when
a
poultryyard
was
established
at
granite
house
he
observed
that
it
would
be
best
to
take
some
precautions
against
a
probable
visit
from
these
fourlegged
plunderers
and
no
one
disputed
this
after
having
turned
the
point
the
settlers
saw
a
long
beach
washed
by
the
open
sea
it
was
then
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
the
sky
was
very
clear
as
it
often
is
after
prolonged
cold
but
warmed
by
their
walk
neither
harding
nor
his
companions
felt
the
sharpness
of
the
atmosphere
too
severely
besides
there
was
no
wind
which
made
it
much
more
bearable
a
brilliant
sun
but
without
any
calorific
action
was
just
issuing
from
the
ocean
the
sea
was
as
tranquil
and
blue
as
that
of
a
mediterranean
gulf
when
the
sky
is
clear
claw
cape
bent
in
the
form
of
a
yataghan
tapered
away
nearly
four
miles
to
the
southeast
to
the
left
the
edge
of
the
marsh
was
abruptly
ended
by
a
little
point
certainly
in
this
part
of
union
bay
which
nothing
sheltered
from
the
open
sea
not
even
a
sandbank
ships
beaten
by
the
east
winds
would
have
found
no
shelter
they
perceived
by
the
tranquillity
of
the
sea
in
which
no
shallows
troubled
the
waters
by
its
uniform
color
which
was
stained
by
no
yellow
shades
by
the
absence
of
even
a
reef
that
the
coast
was
steep
and
that
the
ocean
there
covered
a
deep
abyss
behind
in
the
west
but
at
a
distance
of
four
miles
rose
the
first
trees
of
the
forests
of
the
far
west
they
might
have
believed
themselves
to
be
on
the
desolate
coast
of
some
island
in
the
antarctic
regions
which
the
ice
had
invaded
the
colonists
halted
at
this
place
for
breakfast
a
fire
of
brushwood
and
dried
seaweed
was
lighted
and
neb
prepared
the
breakfast
of
cold
meat
to
which
he
added
some
cups
of
oswego
tea
while
eating
they
looked
around
them
this
part
of
lincoln
island
was
very
sterile
and
contrasted
with
all
the
western
part
the
reporter
was
thus
led
to
observe
that
if
chance
had
thrown
them
at
first
on
the
shore
they
would
have
had
but
a
deplorable
idea
of
their
future
domain
i
believe
that
we
should
not
have
been
able
to
reach
it
replied
the
engineer
for
the
sea
is
deep
and
there
is
not
a
rock
on
which
we
could
have
taken
refuge
before
granite
house
at
least
there
were
sandbanks
an
islet
which
multiplied
our
chances
of
safety
here
nothing
but
the
depths
it
is
singular
enough
remarked
spilett
that
this
comparatively
small
island
should
present
such
varied
ground
this
diversity
of
aspect
logically
only
belongs
to
continents
of
a
certain
extent
one
would
really
say
that
the
western
part
of
lincoln
island
so
rich
and
so
fertile
is
washed
by
the
warm
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
that
its
shores
to
the
north
and
the
southeast
extend
over
a
sort
of
arctic
sea
you
are
right
my
dear
spilett
replied
cyrus
harding
i
have
also
observed
this
i
think
the
form
and
also
the
nature
of
this
island
strange
it
is
a
summary
of
all
the
aspects
which
a
continent
presents
and
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
it
was
a
continent
formerly
what
a
continent
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
cried
pencroft
why
not
replied
cyrus
harding
why
should
not
australia
new
ireland
australasia
united
to
the
archipelagoes
of
the
pacific
have
once
formed
a
sixth
part
of
the
world
as
important
as
europe
or
asia
as
africa
or
the
two
americas
to
my
mind
it
is
quite
possible
that
all
these
islands
emerging
from
this
vast
ocean
are
but
the
summits
of
a
continent
now
submerged
but
which
was
above
the
waters
at
a
prehistoric
period
as
the
atlantis
was
formerly
replied
herbert
yes
my
boy
if
however
it
existed
and
would
lincoln
island
have
been
a
part
of
that
continent
asked
pencroft
it
is
probable
replied
cyrus
harding
and
that
would
sufficiently
explain
the
variety
of
productions
which
are
seen
on
its
surface
and
the
great
number
of
animals
which
still
inhabit
it
added
herbert
yes
my
boy
replied
the
engineer
and
you
furnish
me
with
an
argument
to
support
my
theory
it
is
certain
after
what
we
have
seen
that
animals
are
numerous
in
this
island
and
what
is
more
strange
that
the
species
are
extremely
varied
there
is
a
reason
for
that
and
to
me
it
is
that
lincoln
island
may
have
formerly
been
a
part
of
some
vast
continent
which
had
gradually
sunk
below
the
pacific
then
some
fine
day
said
pencroft
who
did
not
appear
to
be
entirely
convinced
the
rest
of
this
ancient
continent
may
disappear
in
its
turn
and
there
will
be
nothing
between
america
and
asia
yes
replied
harding
there
will
be
new
continents
which
millions
and
millions
of
animalculae
are
building
at
this
moment
and
what
are
these
masons
asked
pencroft
coral
insects
replied
cyrus
harding
by
constant
work
they
made
the
island
of
clermonttonnerre
and
numerous
other
coral
islands
in
the
pacific
ocean
fortyseven
millions
of
these
insects
are
needed
to
weigh
a
grain
and
yet
with
the
seasalt
they
absorb
the
solid
elements
of
water
which
they
assimilate
these
animalculae
produce
limestone
and
this
limestone
forms
enormous
submarine
erections
of
which
the
hardness
and
solidity
equal
granite
formerly
at
the
first
periods
of
creation
nature
employing
fire
heaved
up
the
land
but
now
she
entrusts
to
these
microscopic
creatures
the
task
of
replacing
this
agent
of
which
the
dynamic
power
in
the
interior
of
the
globe
has
evidently
diminishedwhich
is
proved
by
the
number
of
volcanoes
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
now
actually
extinct
and
i
believe
that
centuries
succeeding
to
centuries
and
insects
to
insects
this
pacific
may
one
day
be
changed
into
a
vast
continent
which
new
generations
will
inhabit
and
civilize
in
their
turn
that
will
take
a
long
time
said
pencroft
nature
has
time
for
it
replied
the
engineer
but
what
would
be
the
use
of
new
continents
asked
herbert
it
appears
to
me
that
the
present
extent
of
habitable
countries
is
sufficient
for
humanity
yet
nature
does
nothing
uselessly
nothing
uselessly
certainly
replied
the
engineer
but
this
is
how
the
necessity
of
new
continents
for
the
future
and
exactly
on
the
tropical
zone
occupied
by
the
coral
islands
may
be
explained
at
least
to
me
this
explanation
appears
plausible
we
are
listening
captain
said
herbert
this
is
my
idea
philosophers
generally
admit
that
some
day
our
globe
will
end
or
rather
that
animal
and
vegetable
life
will
no
longer
be
possible
because
of
the
intense
cold
to
which
it
will
be
subjected
what
they
are
not
agreed
upon
is
the
cause
of
this
cold
some
think
that
it
will
arise
from
the
falling
of
the
temperature
which
the
sun
will
experience
after
millions
of
years
others
from
the
gradual
extinction
of
the
fires
in
the
interior
of
our
globe
which
have
a
greater
influence
on
it
than
is
generally
supposed
i
hold
to
this
last
hypothesis
grounding
it
on
the
fact
that
the
moon
is
really
a
cold
star
which
is
no
longer
habitable
although
the
sun
continues
to
throw
on
its
surface
the
same
amount
of
heat
if
then
the
moon
has
become
cold
it
is
because
the
interior
fires
to
which
as
do
all
the
stars
of
the
stellar
world
it
owes
its
origin
are
completely
extinct
lastly
whatever
may
be
the
cause
our
globe
will
become
cold
some
day
but
this
cold
will
only
operate
gradually
what
will
happen
then
the
temperate
zones
at
a
more
or
less
distant
period
will
not
be
more
habitable
than
the
polar
regions
now
are
then
the
population
of
men
as
well
as
the
animals
will
flow
towards
the
latitudes
which
are
more
directly
under
the
solar
influence
an
immense
emigration
will
take
place
europe
central
asia
north
america
will
gradually
be
abandoned
as
well
as
australasia
and
the
lower
parts
of
south
america
the
vegetation
will
follow
the
human
emigration
the
flora
will
retreat
towards
the
equator
at
the
same
time
as
the
fauna
the
central
parts
of
south
america
and
africa
will
be
the
continents
chiefly
inhabited
the
laplanders
and
the
samoides
will
find
the
climate
of
the
polar
regions
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
who
can
say
that
at
this
period
the
equatorial
regions
will
not
be
too
small
to
contain
and
nourish
terrestrial
humanity
now
may
not
provident
nature
so
as
to
give
refuge
to
all
the
vegetable
and
animal
emigration
be
at
present
laying
the
foundation
of
a
new
continent
under
the
equator
and
may
she
not
have
entrusted
these
insects
with
the
construction
of
it
i
have
often
thought
of
all
these
things
my
friends
and
i
seriously
believe
that
the
aspect
of
our
globe
will
some
day
be
completely
changed
that
by
the
raising
of
new
continents
the
sea
will
cover
the
old
and
that
in
future
ages
a
columbus
will
go
to
discover
the
islands
of
chimborazo
of
the
himalayas
or
of
mont
blanc
remains
of
a
submerged
america
asia
and
europe
then
these
new
continents
will
become
in
their
turn
uninhabitable
heat
will
die
away
as
does
the
heat
from
a
body
when
the
soul
has
left
it
and
life
will
disappear
from
the
globe
if
not
for
ever
at
least
for
a
period
perhaps
then
our
spheroid
will
restwill
be
left
to
deathto
revive
some
day
under
superior
conditions
but
all
that
my
friends
is
the
secret
of
the
author
of
all
things
and
beginning
by
the
work
of
the
insects
i
have
perhaps
let
myself
be
carried
too
far
in
investigating
the
secrets
of
the
future
my
dear
cyrus
replied
spilett
these
theories
are
prophecies
to
me
and
they
will
be
accomplished
some
day
that
is
the
secret
of
god
said
the
engineer
all
that
is
well
and
good
then
said
pencroft
who
had
listened
with
all
his
might
but
will
you
tell
me
captain
if
lincoln
island
has
been
made
by
your
insects
no
replied
harding
it
is
of
a
purely
volcanic
origin
then
it
will
disappear
some
day
that
is
probable
i
hope
we
wont
be
here
then
no
dont
be
uneasy
pencroft
we
shall
not
be
here
then
as
we
have
no
wish
to
die
here
and
hope
to
get
away
some
time
in
the
meantime
replied
gideon
spilett
let
us
establish
ourselves
here
as
if
forever
there
is
no
use
in
doing
things
by
halves
this
ended
the
conversation
breakfast
was
finished
the
exploration
was
continued
and
the
settlers
arrived
at
the
border
of
the
marshy
region
it
was
a
marsh
of
which
the
extent
to
the
rounded
coast
which
terminated
the
island
at
the
southeast
was
about
twenty
square
miles
the
soil
was
formed
of
clayey
flintearth
mingled
with
vegetable
matter
such
as
the
remains
of
rushes
reeds
grass
etc
here
and
there
beds
of
grass
thick
as
a
carpet
covered
it
in
many
places
icy
pools
sparkled
in
the
sun
neither
rain
nor
any
river
increased
by
a
sudden
swelling
could
supply
these
ponds
they
therefore
naturally
concluded
that
the
marsh
was
fed
by
the
infiltrations
of
the
soil
and
it
was
really
so
it
was
also
to
be
feared
that
during
the
heat
miasmas
would
arise
which
might
produce
fevers
above
the
aquatic
plants
on
the
surface
of
the
stagnant
water
fluttered
numbers
of
birds
wild
duck
teal
snipe
lived
there
in
flocks
and
those
fearless
birds
allowed
themselves
to
be
easily
approached
one
shot
from
a
gun
would
certainly
have
brought
down
some
dozen
of
the
birds
they
were
so
close
together
the
explorers
were
however
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
bows
and
arrows
the
result
was
less
but
the
silent
arrow
had
the
advantage
of
not
frightening
the
birds
while
the
noise
of
firearms
would
have
dispersed
them
to
all
parts
of
the
marsh
the
hunters
were
satisfied
for
this
time
with
a
dozen
ducks
which
had
white
bodies
with
a
band
of
cinnamon
a
green
head
wings
black
white
and
red
and
flattened
beak
herbert
called
them
tadorns
top
helped
in
the
capture
of
these
birds
whose
name
was
given
to
this
marshy
part
of
the
island
the
settlers
had
here
an
abundant
reserve
of
aquatic
game
at
some
future
time
they
meant
to
explore
it
more
carefully
and
it
was
probable
that
some
of
the
birds
there
might
be
domesticated
or
at
least
brought
to
the
shores
of
the
lake
so
that
they
would
be
more
within
their
reach
about
five
oclock
in
the
evening
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
retraced
their
steps
to
their
dwelling
by
traversing
tadorns
fens
and
crossed
the
mercy
on
the
icebridge
at
eight
in
the
evening
they
all
entered

chapter
22
this
intense
cold
lasted
till
the
15th
of
august
without
however
passing
the
degree
of
fahrenheit
already
mentioned
when
the
atmosphere
was
calm
the
low
temperature
was
easily
borne
but
when
the
wind
blew
the
poor
settlers
insufficiently
clothed
felt
it
severely
pencroft
regretted
that
lincoln
island
was
not
the
home
of
a
few
families
of
bears
rather
than
of
so
many
foxes
and
seals
bears
said
he
are
generally
very
well
dressed
and
i
ask
no
more
than
to
borrow
for
the
winter
the
warm
cloaks
which
they
have
on
their
backs
but
replied
neb
laughing
perhaps
the
bears
would
not
consent
to
give
you
their
cloaks
pencroft
these
beasts
are
not
st
martins
we
would
make
them
do
it
neb
we
would
make
them
replied
pencroft
in
quite
an
authoritative
tone
but
these
formidable
carnivora
did
not
exist
in
the
island
or
at
any
rate
they
had
not
yet
shown
themselves
in
the
meanwhile
herbert
pencroft
and
the
reporter
occupied
themselves
with
making
traps
on
prospect
heights
and
at
the
border
of
the
forest
according
to
the
sailor
any
animal
whatever
it
was
would
be
a
lawful
prize
and
the
rodents
or
carnivora
which
might
get
into
the
new
snares
would
be
well
received
at
granite
house
the
traps
were
besides
extremely
simple
being
pits
dug
in
the
ground
a
platform
of
branches
and
grass
above
which
concealed
the
opening
and
at
the
bottom
some
bait
the
scent
of
which
would
attract
animals
it
must
be
mentioned
also
that
they
had
not
been
dug
at
random
but
at
certain
places
where
numerous
footprints
showed
that
quadrupeds
frequented
the
ground
they
were
visited
every
day
and
at
three
different
times
during
the
first
days
specimens
of
those
antarctic
foxes
which
they
had
already
seen
on
the
right
bank
of
the
mercy
were
found
in
them
why
there
are
nothing
but
foxes
in
this
country
cried
pencroft
when
for
the
third
time
he
drew
one
of
the
animals
out
of
the
pit
looking
at
it
in
great
disgust
he
added
beasts
which
are
good
for
nothing
yes
said
gideon
spilett
they
are
good
for
something
and
what
is
that
to
make
bait
to
attract
other
creatures
the
reporter
was
right
and
the
traps
were
henceforward
baited
with
the
foxes
carcasses
the
sailor
had
also
made
snares
from
the
long
tough
fibers
of
a
certain
plant
and
they
were
even
more
successful
than
the
traps
rarely
a
day
passed
without
some
rabbits
from
the
warren
being
caught
it
was
always
rabbit
but
neb
knew
how
to
vary
his
sauces
and
the
settlers
did
not
think
of
complaining
however
once
or
twice
in
the
second
week
of
august
the
traps
supplied
the
hunters
with
other
animals
more
useful
than
foxes
namely
several
of
those
small
wild
boars
which
had
already
been
seen
to
the
north
of
the
lake
pencroft
had
no
need
to
ask
if
these
beasts
were
eatable
he
could
see
that
by
their
resemblance
to
the
pig
of
america
and
europe
but
these
are
not
pigs
said
herbert
to
him
i
warn
you
of
that
pencroft
my
boy
replied
the
sailor
bending
over
the
trap
and
drawing
out
one
of
these
representatives
of
the
family
of
sus
by
the
little
appendage
which
served
it
as
a
tail
let
me
believe
that
these
are
pigs
why
because
that
pleases
me
are
you
very
fond
of
pig
then
pencroft
i
am
very
fond
of
pig
replied
the
sailor
particularly
of
its
feet
and
if
it
had
eight
instead
of
four
i
should
like
it
twice
as
much
as
to
the
animals
in
question
they
were
peccaries
belonging
to
one
of
the
four
species
which
are
included
in
the
family
and
they
were
also
of
the
species
of
tajacu
recognizable
by
their
deep
color
and
the
absence
of
those
long
teeth
with
which
the
mouths
of
their
congeners
are
armed
these
peccaries
generally
live
in
herds
and
it
was
probable
that
they
abounded
in
the
woody
parts
of
the
island
at
any
rate
they
were
eatable
from
head
to
foot
and
pencroft
did
not
ask
more
from
them
towards
the
15th
of
august
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
was
suddenly
moderated
by
the
wind
shifting
to
the
northwest
the
temperature
rose
some
degrees
and
the
accumulated
vapor
in
the
air
was
not
long
in
resolving
into
snow
all
the
island
was
covered
with
a
sheet
of
white
and
showed
itself
to
its
inhabitants
under
a
new
aspect
the
snow
fell
abundantly
for
several
days
and
it
soon
reached
a
thickness
of
two
feet
the
wind
also
blew
with
great
violence
and
at
the
height
of
granite
house
the
sea
could
be
heard
thundering
against
the
reefs
in
some
places
the
wind
eddying
round
the
corners
formed
the
snow
into
tall
whirling
columns
resembling
those
waterspouts
which
turn
round
on
their
base
and
which
vessels
attack
with
a
shot
from
a
gun
however
the
storm
coming
from
the
northwest
blew
across
the
island
and
the
position
of
granite
house
preserved
it
from
a
direct
attack
but
in
the
midst
of
this
snowstorm
as
terrible
as
if
it
had
been
produced
in
some
polar
country
neither
cyrus
harding
nor
his
companions
could
notwithstanding
their
wish
for
it
venture
forth
and
they
remained
shut
up
for
five
days
from
the
20th
to
the
25th
of
august
they
could
hear
the
tempest
raging
in
jacamar
wood
which
would
surely
suffer
from
it
many
of
the
trees
would
no
doubt
be
torn
up
by
the
roots
but
pencroft
consoled
himself
by
thinking
that
he
would
not
have
the
trouble
of
cutting
them
down
the
wind
is
turning
woodman
let
it
alone
he
repeated
besides
there
was
no
way
of
stopping
it
if
they
had
wished
to
do
so
how
grateful
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
then
were
to
heaven
for
having
prepared
for
them
this
solid
and
immovable
retreat
cyrus
harding
had
also
his
legitimate
share
of
thanks
but
after
all
it
was
nature
who
had
hollowed
out
this
vast
cavern
and
he
had
only
discovered
it
there
all
were
in
safety
and
the
tempest
could
not
reach
them
if
they
had
constructed
a
house
of
bricks
and
wood
on
prospect
heights
it
certainly
would
not
have
resisted
the
fury
of
this
storm
as
to
the
chimneys
it
must
have
been
absolutely
uninhabitable
for
the
sea
passing
over
the
islet
would
beat
furiously
against
it
but
here
in
granite
house
in
the
middle
of
a
solid
mass
over
which
neither
the
sea
nor
air
had
any
influence
there
was
nothing
to
fear
during
these
days
of
seclusion
the
settlers
did
not
remain
inactive
there
was
no
want
of
wood
cut
up
into
planks
in
the
storeroom
and
little
by
little
they
completed
their
furnishing
constructing
the
most
solid
of
tables
and
chairs
for
material
was
not
spared
neb
and
pencroft
were
very
proud
of
this
rather
heavy
furniture
which
they
would
not
have
changed
on
any
account
then
the
carpenters
became
basketmakers
and
they
did
not
succeed
badly
in
this
new
manufacture
at
the
point
of
the
lake
which
projected
to
the
north
they
had
discovered
an
osierbed
in
which
grew
a
large
number
of
purple
osiers
before
the
rainy
season
pencroft
and
herbert
had
cut
down
these
useful
shrubs
and
their
branches
well
prepared
could
now
be
effectively
employed
the
first
attempts
were
somewhat
crude
but
in
consequence
of
the
cleverness
and
intelligence
of
the
workmen
by
consulting
and
recalling
the
models
which
they
had
seen
and
by
emulating
each
other
the
possessions
of
the
colony
were
soon
increased
by
several
baskets
of
different
sizes
the
storeroom
was
provided
with
them
and
in
special
baskets
neb
placed
his
collection
of
rhizomes
stonepine
almonds
etc
during
the
last
week
of
the
month
of
august
the
weather
moderated
again
the
temperature
fell
a
little
and
the
tempest
abated
the
colonists
sallied
out
directly
there
was
certainly
two
feet
of
snow
on
the
shore
but
they
were
able
to
walk
without
much
difficulty
on
the
hardened
surface
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
climbed
prospect
heights
what
a
change
the
woods
which
they
had
left
green
especially
in
the
part
at
which
the
firs
predominated
had
disappeared
under
a
uniform
color
all
was
white
from
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
to
the
shore
the
forests
the
plains
the
lake
the
river
the
waters
of
the
mercy
flowed
under
a
roof
of
ice
which
at
each
rising
and
ebbing
of
the
tide
broke
up
with
loud
crashes
numerous
birds
fluttered
over
the
frozen
surface
of
the
lake
ducks
and
snipe
teal
and
guillemots
were
assembled
in
thousands
the
rocks
among
which
the
cascade
flowed
were
bristling
with
icicles
one
might
have
said
that
the
water
escaped
by
a
monstrous
gargoyle
shaped
with
all
the
imagination
of
an
artist
of
the
renaissance
as
to
the
damage
caused
by
the
storm
in
the
forest
that
could
not
as
yet
be
ascertained
they
would
have
to
wait
till
the
snowy
covering
was
dissipated
gideon
spilett
pencroft
and
herbert
did
not
miss
this
opportunity
of
going
to
visit
their
traps
they
did
not
find
them
easily
under
the
snow
with
which
they
were
covered
they
had
also
to
be
careful
not
to
fall
into
one
or
other
of
them
which
would
have
been
both
dangerous
and
humiliating
to
be
taken
in
their
own
snares
but
happily
they
avoided
this
unpleasantness
and
found
their
traps
perfectly
intact
no
animal
had
fallen
into
them
and
yet
the
footprints
in
the
neighborhood
were
very
numerous
among
others
certain
very
clear
marks
of
claws
herbert
did
not
hesitate
to
affirm
that
some
animal
of
the
feline
species
had
passed
there
which
justified
the
engineers
opinion
that
dangerous
beasts
existed
in
lincoln
island
these
animals
doubtless
generally
lived
in
the
forests
of
the
far
west
but
pressed
by
hunger
they
had
ventured
as
far
as
prospect
heights
perhaps
they
had
smelled
out
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
now
what
are
these
feline
creatures
asked
pencroft
they
are
tigers
replied
herbert
i
thought
those
beasts
were
only
found
in
hot
countries
on
the
new
continent
replied
the
lad
they
are
found
from
mexico
to
the
pampas
of
buenos
aires
now
as
lincoln
island
is
nearly
under
the
same
latitude
as
the
provinces
of
la
plata
it
is
not
surprising
that
tigers
are
to
be
met
with
in
it
well
we
must
look
out
for
them
replied
pencroft
however
the
snow
soon
disappeared
quickly
dissolving
under
the
influence
of
the
rising
temperature
rain
fell
and
the
sheet
of
white
soon
vanished
notwithstanding
the
bad
weather
the
settlers
renewed
their
stores
of
different
things
stonepine
almonds
rhizomes
syrup
from
the
mapletree
for
the
vegetable
part
rabbits
from
the
warren
agouties
and
kangaroos
for
the
animal
part
this
necessitated
several
excursions
into
the
forest
and
they
found
that
a
great
number
of
trees
had
been
blown
down
by
the
last
hurricane
pencroft
and
neb
also
pushed
with
the
cart
as
far
as
the
vein
of
coal
and
brought
back
several
tons
of
fuel
they
saw
in
passing
that
the
pottery
kiln
had
been
severely
damaged
by
the
wind
at
least
six
feet
of
it
having
been
blown
off
at
the
same
time
as
the
coal
the
store
of
wood
was
renewed
at
granite
house
and
they
profited
by
the
current
of
the
mercy
having
again
become
free
to
float
down
several
rafts
they
could
see
that
the
cold
period
was
not
ended
a
visit
was
also
paid
to
the
chimneys
and
the
settlers
could
not
but
congratulate
themselves
on
not
having
been
living
there
during
the
hurricane
the
sea
had
left
unquestionable
traces
of
its
ravages
sweeping
over
the
islet
it
had
furiously
assailed
the
passages
half
filling
them
with
sand
while
thick
beds
of
seaweed
covered
the
rocks
while
neb
herbert
and
pencroft
hunted
or
collected
wood
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
busied
themselves
in
putting
the
chimneys
to
rights
and
they
found
the
forge
and
the
bellows
almost
unhurt
protected
as
they
had
been
from
the
first
by
the
heaps
of
sand
the
store
of
fuel
had
not
been
made
uselessly
the
settlers
had
not
done
with
the
rigorous
cold
it
is
known
that
in
the
northern
hemisphere
the
month
of
february
is
principally
distinguished
by
rapid
fallings
of
the
temperature
it
is
the
same
in
the
southern
hemisphere
and
the
end
of
the
month
of
august
which
is
the
february
of
north
america
does
not
escape
this
climatic
law
about
the
25th
after
another
change
from
snow
to
rain
the
wind
shifted
to
the
southeast
and
the
cold
became
suddenly
very
severe
according
to
the
engineers
calculation
the
mercurial
column
of
a
fahrenheit
thermometer
would
not
have
marked
less
than
eight
degrees
below
zero
and
this
intense
cold
rendered
still
more
painful
by
a
sharp
gale
lasted
for
several
days
the
colonists
were
again
shut
up
in
granite
house
and
as
it
was
necessary
to
hermetically
seal
all
the
openings
of
the
facade
only
leaving
a
narrow
passage
for
renewing
the
air
the
consumption
of
candles
was
considerable
to
economize
them
the
cavern
was
often
only
lighted
by
the
blazing
hearths
on
which
fuel
was
not
spared
several
times
one
or
other
of
the
settlers
descended
to
the
beach
in
the
midst
of
ice
which
the
waves
heaped
up
at
each
tide
but
they
soon
climbed
up
again
to
granite
house
and
it
was
not
without
pain
and
difficulty
that
their
hands
could
hold
to
the
rounds
of
the
ladder
in
consequence
of
the
intense
cold
their
fingers
felt
as
if
burned
when
they
touched
the
rounds
to
occupy
the
leisure
hours
which
the
tenants
of
granite
house
now
had
at
their
disposal
cyrus
harding
undertook
an
operation
which
could
be
performed
indoors
we
know
that
the
settlers
had
no
other
sugar
at
their
disposal
than
the
liquid
substance
which
they
drew
from
the
maple
by
making
deep
incisions
in
the
tree
they
contented
themselves
with
collecting
this
liquor
in
jars
and
employing
it
in
this
state
for
different
culinary
purposes
and
the
more
so
as
on
growing
old
this
liquid
began
to
become
white
and
to
be
of
a
syrupy
consistence
but
there
was
something
better
to
be
made
of
it
and
one
day
cyrus
harding
announced
that
they
were
going
to
turn
into
refiners
refiners
replied
pencroft
that
is
rather
a
warm
trade
i
think
very
warm
answered
the
engineer
then
it
will
be
seasonable
said
the
sailor
this
word
refining
need
not
awake
in
the
mind
thoughts
of
an
elaborate
manufactory
with
apparatus
and
numerous
workmen
no
to
crystallize
this
liquor
only
an
extremely
easy
operation
is
required
placed
on
the
fire
in
large
earthen
pots
it
was
simply
subjected
to
evaporation
and
soon
a
scum
arose
to
its
surface
as
soon
as
this
began
to
thicken
neb
carefully
removed
it
with
a
wooden
spatula
this
accelerated
the
evaporation
and
at
the
same
time
prevented
it
from
contracting
an
empyreumatic
flavor
after
boiling
for
several
hours
on
a
hot
fire
which
did
as
much
good
to
the
operators
as
the
substance
operated
upon
the
latter
was
transformed
into
a
thick
syrup
this
syrup
was
poured
into
clay
molds
previously
fabricated
in
the
kitchen
stove
and
to
which
they
had
given
various
shapes
the
next
day
this
syrup
had
become
cold
and
formed
cakes
and
tablets
this
was
sugar
of
rather
a
reddish
color
but
nearly
transparent
and
of
a
delicious
taste
the
cold
continued
to
the
middle
of
september
and
the
prisoners
in
granite
house
began
to
find
their
captivity
rather
tedious
nearly
every
day
they
attempted
sorties
which
they
could
not
prolong
they
constantly
worked
at
the
improvement
of
their
dwelling
they
talked
while
working
harding
instructed
his
companions
in
many
things
principally
explaining
to
them
the
practical
applications
of
science
the
colonists
had
no
library
at
their
disposal
but
the
engineer
was
a
book
which
was
always
at
hand
always
open
at
the
page
which
one
wanted
a
book
which
answered
all
their
questions
and
which
they
often
consulted
the
time
thus
passed
away
pleasantly
these
brave
men
not
appearing
to
have
any
fears
for
the
future
however
all
were
anxious
to
see
if
not
the
fine
season
at
least
the
cessation
of
the
insupportable
cold
if
only
they
had
been
clothed
in
a
way
to
meet
it
how
many
excursions
they
would
have
attempted
either
to
the
downs
or
to
tadorns
fens
game
would
have
been
easily
approached
and
the
chase
would
certainly
have
been
most
productive
but
cyrus
harding
considered
it
of
importance
that
no
one
should
injure
his
health
for
he
had
need
of
all
his
hands
and
his
advice
was
followed
but
it
must
be
said
that
the
one
who
was
most
impatient
of
this
imprisonment
after
pencroft
perhaps
was
top
the
faithful
dog
found
granite
house
very
narrow
he
ran
backwards
and
forwards
from
one
room
to
another
showing
in
his
way
how
weary
he
was
of
being
shut
up
harding
often
remarked
that
when
he
approached
the
dark
well
which
communicated
with
the
sea
and
of
which
the
orifice
opened
at
the
back
of
the
storeroom
top
uttered
singular
growlings
he
ran
round
and
round
this
hole
which
had
been
covered
with
a
wooden
lid
sometimes
even
he
tried
to
put
his
paws
under
the
lid
as
if
he
wished
to
raise
it
he
then
yelped
in
a
peculiar
way
which
showed
at
once
anger
and
uneasiness
the
engineer
observed
this
maneuver
several
times
what
could
there
be
in
this
abyss
to
make
such
an
impression
on
the
intelligent
animal
the
well
led
to
the
sea
that
was
certain
could
narrow
passages
spread
from
it
through
the
foundations
of
the
island
did
some
marine
monster
come
from
time
to
time
to
breathe
at
the
bottom
of
this
well
the
engineer
did
not
know
what
to
think
and
could
not
refrain
from
dreaming
of
many
strange
improbabilities
accustomed
to
go
far
into
the
regions
of
scientific
reality
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
drawn
into
the
regions
of
the
strange
and
almost
of
the
supernatural
but
yet
how
to
explain
why
top
one
of
those
sensible
dogs
who
never
waste
their
time
in
barking
at
the
moon
should
persist
in
trying
with
scent
and
hearing
to
fathom
this
abyss
if
there
was
nothing
there
to
cause
his
uneasiness
tops
conduct
puzzled
cyrus
harding
even
more
than
he
cared
to
acknowledge
to
himself
at
all
events
the
engineer
only
communicated
his
impressions
to
gideon
spilett
for
he
thought
it
useless
to
explain
to
his
companions
the
suspicions
which
arose
from
what
perhaps
was
only
tops
fancy
at
last
the
cold
ceased
there
had
been
rain
squalls
mingled
with
snow
hailstorms
gusts
of
wind
but
these
inclemencies
did
not
last
the
ice
melted
the
snow
disappeared
the
shore
the
plateau
the
banks
of
the
mercy
the
forest
again
became
practicable
this
return
of
spring
delighted
the
tenants
of
granite
house
and
they
soon
only
passed
in
it
the
hours
necessary
for
eating
and
sleeping
they
hunted
much
in
the
second
part
of
september
which
led
pencroft
to
again
entreat
for
the
firearms
which
he
asserted
had
been
promised
by
cyrus
harding
the
latter
knowing
well
that
without
special
tools
it
would
be
nearly
impossible
for
him
to
manufacture
a
gun
which
would
be
of
any
use
still
drew
back
and
put
off
the
operation
to
some
future
time
observing
in
his
usual
dry
way
that
herbert
and
spilett
had
become
very
skilful
archers
so
that
many
sorts
of
excellent
animals
agouties
kangaroos
capybaras
pigeons
bustards
wild
ducks
snipes
in
short
game
both
with
fur
and
feathers
fell
victims
to
their
arrows
and
that
consequently
they
could
wait
but
the
obstinate
sailor
would
listen
to
nothing
of
this
and
he
would
give
the
engineer
no
peace
till
he
promised
to
satisfy
his
desire
gideon
spilett
however
supported
pencroft
if
which
may
be
doubted
said
he
the
island
is
inhabited
by
wild
beasts
we
must
think
how
to
fight
with
and
exterminate
them
a
time
may
come
when
this
will
be
our
first
duty
but
at
this
period
it
was
not
the
question
of
firearms
which
occupied
harding
but
that
of
clothes
those
which
the
settlers
wore
had
passed
this
winter
but
they
would
not
last
until
next
winter
skins
of
carnivora
or
the
wool
of
ruminants
must
be
procured
at
any
price
and
since
there
were
plenty
of
musmons
it
was
agreed
to
consult
on
the
means
of
forming
a
flock
which
might
be
brought
up
for
the
use
of
the
colony
an
enclosure
for
the
domestic
animals
a
poultryyard
for
the
birds
in
a
word
to
establish
a
sort
of
farm
in
the
island
such
were
the
two
important
projects
for
the
fine
season
in
consequence
and
in
view
of
these
future
establishments
it
became
of
much
importance
that
they
should
penetrate
into
all
the
yet
unknown
parts
of
lincoln
island
that
is
to
say
through
that
thick
forest
which
extended
on
the
right
bank
of
the
mercy
from
its
mouth
to
the
extremity
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
as
well
as
on
the
whole
of
its
western
side
but
this
needed
settled
weather
and
a
month
must
pass
before
this
exploration
could
be
profitably
undertaken
they
therefore
waited
with
some
impatience
when
an
incident
occurred
which
increased
the
desire
the
settlers
had
to
visit
the
whole
of
their
domain
it
was
the
24th
of
october
on
this
day
pencroft
had
gone
to
visit
his
traps
which
he
always
kept
properly
baited
in
one
of
them
he
found
three
animals
which
would
be
very
welcome
for
the
larder
they
were
a
female
peccary
and
her
two
young
ones
pencroft
then
returned
to
granite
house
enchanted
with
his
capture
and
as
usual
he
made
a
great
show
of
his
game
come
we
shall
have
a
grand
feast
captain
he
exclaimed
and
you
too
mr
spilett
you
will
eat
some
i
shall
be
very
happy
replied
the
reporter
but
what
is
it
that
i
am
going
to
eat
sucklingpig
oh
indeed
sucklingpig
pencroft
to
hear
you
i
thought
that
you
were
bringing
back
a
young
partridge
stuffed
with
truffles
what
cried
pencroft
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
turn
up
your
nose
at
sucklingpig
no
replied
gideon
spilett
without
showing
any
enthusiasm
provided
one
doesnt
eat
too
much
thats
right
thats
right
returned
the
sailor
who
was
not
pleased
whenever
he
heard
his
chase
made
light
of
you
like
to
make
objections
seven
months
ago
when
we
landed
on
the
island
you
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
have
met
with
such
game
well
well
replied
the
reporter
man
is
never
perfect
nor
contented
now
said
pencroft
i
hope
that
neb
will
distinguish
himself
look
here
these
two
little
peccaries
are
not
more
than
three
months
old
they
will
be
as
tender
as
quails
come
along
neb
come
i
will
look
after
the
cooking
myself
and
the
sailor
followed
by
neb
entered
the
kitchen
where
they
were
soon
absorbed
in
their
culinary
labors
they
were
allowed
to
do
it
in
their
own
way
neb
therefore
prepared
a
magnificent
repastthe

in

all
the
best
that
they
had
but
among
all
the
dishes
figured
in
the
first
rank
the
savory
peccaries
at
five
oclock
dinner
was
served
in
the
diningroom
of
granite
house
the
kangaroo
soup
was
smoking
on
the
table
they
found
it
excellent
to
the
soup
succeeded
the
peccaries
which
pencroft
insisted
on
carving
himself
and
of
which
he
served
out
monstrous
portions
to
each
of
the
guests
these
sucklingpigs
were
really
delicious
and
pencroft
was
devouring
his
share
with
great
gusto
when
all
at
once
a
cry
and
an
oath
escaped
him
whats
the
matter
asked
cyrus
harding
the
matter
the
matter
is
that
i
have
just
broken
a
tooth
replied
the
sailor
what
are
there
pebbles
in
your
peccaries
said
gideon
spilett
i
suppose
so
replied
pencroft
drawing
from
his
lips
the
object
which
had
cost
him
a
grinder
it
was
not

it
was
now
exactly
seven
months
since
the
balloon
voyagers
had
been
thrown
on
lincoln
island
during
that
time
notwithstanding
the
researches
they
had
made
no
human
being
had
been
discovered
no
smoke
even
had
betrayed
the
presence
of
man
on
the
surface
of
the
island
no
vestiges
of
his
handiwork
showed
that
either
at
an
early
or
at
a
late
period
had
man
lived
there
not
only
did
it
now
appear
to
be
uninhabited
by
any
but
themselves
but
the
colonists
were
compelled
to
believe
that
it
never
had
been
inhabited
and
now
all
this
scaffolding
of
reasonings
fell
before
a
simple
ball
of
metal
found
in
the
body
of
an
inoffensive
rodent
in
fact
this
bullet
must
have
issued
from
a
firearm
and
who
but
a
human
being
could
have
used
such
a
weapon
when
pencroft
had
placed
the
bullet
on
the
table
his
companions
looked
at
it
with
intense
astonishment
all
the
consequences
likely
to
result
from
this
incident
notwithstanding
its
apparent
insignificance
immediately
took
possession
of
their
minds
the
sudden
apparition
of
a
supernatural
being
could
not
have
startled
them
more
completely
cyrus
harding
did
not
hesitate
to
give
utterance
to
the
suggestions
which
this
fact
at
once
surprising
and
unexpected
could
not
fail
to
raise
in
his
mind
he
took
the
bullet
turned
it
over
and
over
rolled
it
between
his
finger
and
thumb
then
turning
to
pencroft
he
asked
are
you
sure
that
the
peccary
wounded
by
this
bullet
was
not
more
than
three
months
old
not
more
captain
replied
pencroft
it
was
still
sucking
its
mother
when
i
found
it
in
the
trap
well
said
the
engineer
that
proves
that
within
three
months
a
gunshot
was
fired
in
lincoln
island
and
that
a

little
animal
that
is
unquestionable
said
cyrus
harding
and
these
are
the
deductions
which
must
be
drawn
from
this
incident
that
the
island
was
inhabited
before
our
arrival
or
that
men
have
landed
here
within
three
months
did
these
men
arrive
here
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
by
disembarking
on
the
shore
or
by
being
wrecked
this
point
can
only
be
cleared
up
later
as
to
what
they
were
europeans
or
malays
enemies
or
friends
of
our
race
we
cannot
possibly
guess
and
if
they
still
inhabit
the
island
or
if
they
have
left
it
we
know
not
but
these
questions
are
of
too
much
importance
to
be
allowed
to
remain
long
unsettled
no
a
hundred
times
no
a
thousand
times
no
cried
the
sailor
springing
up
from
the
table
there
are
no
other
men
than
ourselves
on
lincoln
island
by
my
faith
the
island
isnt
large
and
if
it
had
been
inhabited
we
should
have
seen
some
of
the
inhabitants
long
before
this
in
fact
the
contrary
would
be
very
astonishing
said
herbert
but
it
would
be
much
more
astonishing
i
should
think
observed
the
reporter
if
this
peccary
had
been
born
with
a
bullet
in
its
inside
at
least
said
neb
seriously
if
pencroft
has
not
had
look
here
neb
burst
out
pencroft
do
you
think
i
could
have
a
bullet
in
my
jaw
for
five
or
six
months
without
finding
it
out
where
could
it
be
hidden
he
asked
opening
his
mouth
to
show
the
twoandthirty
teeth
with
which
it
was
furnished
look
well
neb
and
if
you
find
one
hollow
tooth
in
this
set
i
will
let
you
pull
out
half
a
dozen
nebs
supposition
is
certainly
inadmissible
replied
harding
who
notwithstanding
the
gravity
of
his
thoughts
could
not
restrain
a
smile
it
is
certain
that
a
gun
has
been
fired
in
the
island
within
three
months
at
most
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
people
who
landed
on
this
coast
were
only
here
a
very
short
time
ago
or
that
they
just
touched
here
for
if
when
we
surveyed
the
island
from
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
it
had
been
inhabited
we
should
have
seen
them
or
we
should
have
been
seen
ourselves
it
is
therefore
probable
that
within
only
a
few
weeks
castaways
have
been
thrown
by
a
storm
on
some
part
of
the
coast
however
that
may
be
it
is
of
consequence
to
us
to
have
this
point
settled
i
think
that
we
should
act
with
caution
said
the
reporter
such
is
my
advice
replied
cyrus
harding
for
it
is
to
be
feared
that
malay
pirates
have
landed
on
the
island
captain
asked
the
sailor
would
it
not
be
a
good
plan
before
setting
out
to
build
a
canoe
in
which
we
could
either
ascend
the
river
or
if
we
liked
coast
round
the
inland
it
will
not
do
to
be
unprovided
your
idea
is
good
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
but
we
cannot
wait
for
that
it
would
take
at
least
a
month
to
build
a
boat
yes
a
real
boat
replied
the
sailor
but
we
do
not
want
one
for
a
sea
voyage
and
in
five
days
at
the
most
i
will
undertake
to
construct
a
canoe
fit
to
navigate
the
mercy
five
days
cried
neb
to
build
a
boat
yes
neb
a
boat
in
the
indian
fashion
of
wood
asked
the
negro
looking
still
unconvinced
of
wood
replied
pencroft
or
rather
of
bark
i
repeat
captain
that
in
five
days
the
work
will
be
finished
in
five
days
then
be
it
replied
the
engineer
but
till
that
time
we
must
be
very
watchful
said
herbert
very
watchful
indeed
my
friends
replied
harding
and
i
beg
you
to
confine
your
hunting
excursions
to
the
neighborhood
of
granite
house
the
dinner
ended
less
gaily
than
pencroft
had
hoped
so
then
the
island
was
or
had
been
inhabited
by
others
than
the
settlers
proved
as
it
was
by
the
incident
of
the
bullet
it
was
hereafter
an
unquestionable
fact
and
such
a
discovery
could
not
but
cause
great
uneasiness
among
the
colonists
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
before
sleeping
conversed
long
about
the
matter
they
asked
themselves
if
by
chance
this
incident
might
not
have
some
connection
with
the
inexplicable
way
in
which
the
engineer
had
been
saved
and
the
other
peculiar
circumstances
which
had
struck
them
at
different
times
however
cyrus
harding
after
having
discussed
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
question
ended
by
saying
in
short
would
you
like
to
know
my
opinion
my
dear
spilett
yes
cyrus
well
then
it
is
this
however
minutely
we
explore
the
island
we
shall
find
nothing
the
next
day
pencroft
set
to
work
he
did
not
mean
to
build
a
boat
with
boards
and
planking
but
simply
a
flatbottomed
canoe
which
would
be
well
suited
for
navigating
the
mercyabove
all
for
approaching
its
source
where
the
water
would
naturally
be
shallow
pieces
of
bark
fastened
one
to
the
other
would
form
a
light
boat
and
in
case
of
natural
obstacles
which
would
render
a
portage
necessary
it
would
be
easily
carried
pencroft
intended
to
secure
the
pieces
of
bark
by
means
of
nails
to
insure
the
canoe
being
watertight
it
was
first
necessary
to
select
the
trees
which
would
afford
a
strong
and
supple
bark
for
the
work
now
the
last
storm
had
brought
down
a
number
of
large
birchtrees
the
bark
of
which
would
be
perfectly
suited
for
their
purpose
some
of
these
trees
lay
on
the
ground
and
they
had
only
to
be
barked
which
was
the
most
difficult
thing
of
all
owing
to
the
imperfect
tools
which
the
settlers
possessed
however
they
overcame
all
difficulties
while
the
sailor
seconded
by
the
engineer
thus
occupied
himself
without
losing
an
hour
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
were
not
idle
they
were
made
purveyors
to
the
colony
the
reporter
could
not
but
admire
the
boy
who
had
acquired
great
skill
in
handling
the
bow
and
spear
herbert
also
showed
great
courage
and
much
of
that
presence
of
mind
which
may
justly
be
called
the
reasoning
of
bravery
these
two
companions
of
the
chase
remembering
cyrus
hardings
recommendations
did
not
go
beyond
a
radius
of
two
miles
round
granite
house
but
the
borders
of
the
forest
furnished
a
sufficient
tribute
of
agoutis
capybaras
kangaroos
peccaries
etc
and
if
the
result
from
the
traps
was
less
than
during
the
cold
still
the
warren
yielded
its
accustomed
quota
which
might
have
fed
all
the
colony
in
lincoln
island
often
during
these
excursions
herbert
talked
with
gideon
spilett
on
the
incident
of
the
bullet
and
the
deductions
which
the
engineer
drew
from
it
and
one
dayit
was
the
26th
of
octoberhe
saidbut
mr
spilett
do
you
not
think
it
very
extraordinary
that
if
any
castaways
have
landed
on
the
island
they
have
not
yet
shown
themselves
near
granite
house
very
astonishing
if
they
are
still
here
replied
the
reporter
but
not
astonishing
at
all
if
they
are
here
no
longer
so
you
think
that
these
people
have
already
quitted
the
island
returned
herbert
it
is
more
than
probable
my
boy
for
if
their
stay
was
prolonged
and
above
all
if
they
were
still
here
some
accident
would
have
at
last
betrayed
their
presence
but
if
they
were
able
to
go
away
observed
the
lad
they
could
not
have
been
castaways
no
herbert
or
at
least
they
were
what
might
be
called
provisional
castaways
it
is
very
possible
that
a
storm
may
have
driven
them
to
the
island
without
destroying
their
vessel
and
that
the
storm
over
they
went
away
again
i
must
acknowledge
one
thing
said
herbert
it
is
that
captain
harding
appears
rather
to
fear
than
desire
the
presence
of
human
beings
on
our
island
in
short
responded
the
reporter
there
are
only
malays
who
frequent
these
seas
and
those
fellows
are
ruffians
which
it
is
best
to
avoid
it
is
not
impossible
mr
spilett
said
herbert
that
some
day
or
other
we
may
find
traces
of
their
landing
i
do
not
say
no
my
boy
a
deserted
camp
the
ashes
of
a
fire
would
put
us
on
the
track
and
this
is
what
we
will
look
for
in
our
next
expedition
the
day
on
which
the
hunters
spoke
thus
they
were
in
a
part
of
the
forest
near
the
mercy
remarkable
for
its
beautiful
trees
there
among
others
rose
to
a
height
of
nearly
200
feet
above
the
ground
some
of
those
superb
coniferae
to
which
in
new
zealand
the
natives
give
the
name
of
kauris
i
have
an
idea
mr
spilett
said
herbert
if
i
were
to
climb
to
the
top
of
one
of
these
kauris
i
could
survey
the
country
for
an
immense
distance
round
the
idea
is
good
replied
the
reporter
but
could
you
climb
to
the
top
of
those
giants
i
can
at
least
try
replied
herbert
the
light
and
active
boy
then
sprang
on
the
first
branches
the
arrangement
of
which
made
the
ascent
of
the
kauri
easy
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
arrived
at
the
summit
which
emerged
from
the
immense
plain
of
verdure
from
this
elevated
situation
his
gaze
extended
over
all
the
southern
portion
of
the
island
from
claw
cape
on
the
southeast
to
reptile
end
on
the
southwest
to
the
northwest
rose
mount
franklin
which
concealed
a
great
part
of
the
horizon
but
herbert
from
the
height
of
his
observatory
could
examine
all
the
yet
unknown
portion
of
the
island
which
might
have
given
shelter
to
the
strangers
whose
presence
they
suspected
the
lad
looked
attentively
there
was
nothing
in
sight
on
the
sea
not
a
sail
neither
on
the
horizon
nor
near
the
island
however
as
the
bank
of
trees
hid
the
shore
it
was
possible
that
a
vessel
especially
if
deprived
of
her
masts
might
lie
close
to
the
land
and
thus
be
invisible
to
herbert
neither
in
the
forests
of
the
far
west
was
anything
to
be
seen
the
wood
formed
an
impenetrable
screen
measuring
several
square
miles
without
a
break
or
an
opening
it
was
impossible
even
to
follow
the
course
of
the
mercy
or
to
ascertain
in
what
part
of
the
mountain
it
took
its
source
perhaps
other
creeks
also
ran
towards
the
west
but
they
could
not
be
seen
but
at
last
if
all
indication
of
an
encampment
escaped
herberts
sight
could
he
not
even
catch
a
glimpse
of
smoke
the
faintest
trace
of
which
would
be
easily
discernible
in
the
pure
atmosphere
for
an
instant
herbert
thought
he
could
perceive
a
slight
smoke
in
the
west
but
a
more
attentive
examination
showed
that
he
was
mistaken
he
strained
his
eyes
in
every
direction
and
his
sight
was
excellent
no
decidedly
there
was
nothing
there
herbert
descended
to
the
foot
of
the
kauri
and
the
two
sportsmen
returned
to
granite
house
there
cyrus
harding
listened
to
the
lads
account
shook
his
head
and
said
nothing
it
was
very
evident
that
no
decided
opinion
could
be
pronounced
on
this
question
until
after
a
complete
exploration
of
the
island
two
days
afterthe
28th
of
octoberanother
incident
occurred
for
which
an
explanation
was
again
required
while
strolling
along
the
shore
about
two
miles
from
granite
house
herbert
and
neb
were
fortunate
enough
to
capture
a
magnificent
specimen
of
the
order
of
chelonia
it
was
a
turtle
of
the
species
midas
the
edible
green
turtle
so
called
from
the
color
both
of
its
shell
and
fat
herbert
caught
sight
of
this
turtle
as
it
was
crawling
among
the
rocks
to
reach
the
sea
help
neb
help
he
cried
neb
ran
up
what
a
fine
animal
said
neb
but
how
are
we
to
catch
it
nothing
is
easier
neb
replied
herbert
we
have
only
to
turn
the
turtle
on
its
back
and
it
cannot
possibly
get
away
take
your
spear
and
do
as
i
do
the
reptile
aware
of
danger
had
retired
between
its
carapace
and
plastron
they
no
longer
saw
its
head
or
feet
and
it
was
motionless
as
a
rock
herbert
and
neb
then
drove
their
sticks
underneath
the
animal
and
by
their
united
efforts
managed
without
difficulty
to
turn
it
on
its
back
the
turtle
which
was
three
feet
in
length
would
have
weighed
at
least
four
hundred
pounds
capital
cried
neb
this
is
something
which
will
rejoice
friend
pencrofts
heart
in
fact
the
heart
of
friend
pencroft
could
not
fail
to
be
rejoiced
for
the
flesh
of
the
turtle
which
feeds
on
wrackgrass
is
extremely
savory
at
this
moment
the
creatures
head
could
be
seen
which
was
small
flat
but
widened
behind
by
the
large
temporal
fossae
hidden
under
the
long
roof
and
now
what
shall
we
do
with
our
prize
said
neb
we
cant
drag
it
to
granite
house
leave
it
here
since
it
cannot
turn
over
replied
herbert
and
we
will
come
back
with
the
cart
to
fetch
it
that
is
the
best
plan
however
for
greater
precaution
herbert
took
the
trouble
which
neb
deemed
superfluous
to
wedge
up
the
animal
with
great
stones
after
which
the
two
hunters
returned
to
granite
house
following
the
beach
which
the
tide
had
left
uncovered
herbert
wishing
to
surprise
pencroft
said
nothing
about
the
superb
specimen
of
a
chelonian
which
they
had
turned
over
on
the
sand
but
two
hours
later
he
and
neb
returned
with
the
cart
to
the
place
where
they
had
left
it
the
superb
specimen
of
a
chelonian
was
no
longer
there
neb
and
herbert
stared
at
each
other
first
then
they
stared
about
them
it
was
just
at
this
spot
that
the
turtle
had
been
left
the
lad
even
found
the
stones
which
he
had
used
and
therefore
he
was
certain
of
not
being
mistaken
well
said
neb
these
beasts
can
turn
themselves
over
then
it
appears
so
replied
herbert
who
could
not
understand
it
at
all
and
was
gazing
at
the
stones
scattered
on
the
sand
well
pencroft
will
be
disgusted
and
captain
harding
will
perhaps
be
very
perplexed
how
to
explain
this
disappearance
thought
herbert
look
here
said
neb
who
wished
to
hide
his
illluck
we
wont
speak
about
it
on
the
contrary
neb
we
must
speak
about
it
replied
herbert
and
the
two
taking
the
cart
which
there
was
now
no
use
for
returned
to
granite
house
arrived
at
the
dockyard
where
the
engineer
and
the
sailor
were
working
together
herbert
recounted
what
had
happened
oh
the
stupids
cried
the
sailor
to
have
let
at
least
fifty
meals
escape
but
pencroft
replied
neb
it
wasnt
our
fault
that
the
beast
got
away
as
i
tell
you
we
had
turned
it
over
on
its
back
then
you
didnt
turn
it
over
enough
returned
the
obstinate
sailor
not
enough
cried
herbert
and
he
told
how
he
had
taken
care
to
wedge
up
the
turtle
with
stones
it
is
a
miracle
then
replied
pencroft
i
thought
captain
said
herbert
that
turtles
once
placed
on
their
backs
could
not
regain
their
feet
especially
when
they
are
of
a
large
size
that
is
true
my
boy
replied
cyrus
harding
then
how
did
it
manage
at
what
distance
from
the
sea
did
you
leave
this
turtle
asked
the
engineer
who
having
suspended
his
work
was
reflecting
on
this
incident
fifteen
feet
at
the
most
replied
herbert
and
the
tide
was
low
at
the
time
yes
captain
well
replied
the
engineer
what
the
turtle
could
not
do
on
the
sand
it
might
have
been
able
to
do
in
the
water
it
turned
over
when
the
tide
overtook
it
and
then
quietly
returned
to
the
deep
sea
oh
what
stupids
we
were
cried
neb
that
is
precisely
what
i
had
the
honor
of
telling
you
before
returned
the
sailor
cyrus
harding
had
given
this
explanation
which
no
doubt
was
admissible
but
was
he
himself
convinced
of
the
accuracy
of
this
explanation
it
cannot
be
said
that
he
was
chapter
2
on
the
9th
of
october
the
bark
canoe
was
entirely
finished
pencroft
had
kept
his
promise
and
a
light
boat
the
shell
of
which
was
joined
together
by
the
flexible
twigs
of
the
crejimba
had
been
constructed
in
five
days
a
seat
in
the
stern
a
second
seat
in
the
middle
to
preserve
the
equilibrium
a
third
seat
in
the
bows
rowlocks
for
the
two
oars
a
scull
to
steer
with
completed
the
little
craft
which
was
twelve
feet
long
and
did
not
weigh
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
the
operation
of
launching
it
was
extremely
simple
the
canoe
was
carried
to
the
beach
and
laid
on
the
sand
before
granite
house
and
the
rising
tide
floated
it
pencroft
who
leaped
in
directly
maneuvered
it
with
the
scull
and
declared
it
to
be
just
the
thing
for
the
purpose
to
which
they
wished
to
put
it
hurrah
cried
the
sailor
who
did
not
disdain
to
celebrate
thus
his
own
triumph
with
this
we
could
go
round
the
world
asked
gideon
spilett
no
the
island
some
stones
for
ballast
a
mast
and
a
sail
which
the
captain
will
make
for
us
some
day
and
we
shall
go
splendidly
well
captainand
you
mr
spilett
and
you
herbert
and
you
nebarent
you
coming
to
try
our
new
vessel
come
along
we
must
see
if
it
will
carry
all
five
of
us
this
was
certainly
a
trial
which
ought
to
be
made
pencroft
soon
brought
the
canoe
to
the
shore
by
a
narrow
passage
among
the
rocks
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
make
a
trial
of
the
boat
that
day
by
following
the
shore
as
far
as
the
first
point
at
which
the
rocks
of
the
south
ended
as
they
embarked
neb
cried
but
your
boat
leaks
rather
pencroft
thats
nothing
neb
replied
the
sailor
the
wood
will
get
seasoned
in
two
days
there
wont
be
a
single
leak
and
our
boat
will
have
no
more
water
in
her
than
there
is
in
the
stomach
of
a
drunkard
jump
in
they
were
soon
all
seated
and
pencroft
shoved
off
the
weather
was
magnificent
the
sea
as
calm
as
if
its
waters
were
contained
within
the
narrow
limits
of
a
lake
thus
the
boat
could
proceed
with
as
much
security
as
if
it
was
ascending
the
tranquil
current
of
the
mercy
neb
took
one
of
the
oars
herbert
the
other
and
pencroft
remained
in
the
stern
in
order
to
use
the
scull
the
sailor
first
crossed
the
channel
and
steered
close
to
the
southern
point
of
the
islet
a
light
breeze
blew
from
the
south
no
roughness
was
found
either
in
the
channel
or
the
green
sea
a
long
swell
which
the
canoe
scarcely
felt
as
it
was
heavily
laden
rolled
regularly
over
the
surface
of
the
water
they
pulled
out
about
half
a
mile
distant
from
the
shore
that
they
might
have
a
good
view
of
mount
franklin
pencroft
afterwards
returned
towards
the
mouth
of
the
river
the
boat
then
skirted
the
shore
which
extending
to
the
extreme
point
hid
all
tadorns
fens
this
point
of
which
the
distance
was
increased
by
the
irregularity
of
the
coast
was
nearly
three
miles
from
the
mercy
the
settlers
resolved
to
go
to
its
extremity
and
only
go
beyond
it
as
much
as
was
necessary
to
take
a
rapid
survey
of
the
coast
as
far
as
claw
cape
the
canoe
followed
the
windings
of
the
shore
avoiding
the
rocks
which
fringed
it
and
which
the
rising
tide
began
to
cover
the
cliff
gradually
sloped
away
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
to
the
point
this
was
formed
of
granite
rocks
capriciously
distributed
very
different
from
the
cliff
at
prospect
heights
and
of
an
extremely
wild
aspect
it
might
have
been
said
that
an
immense
cartload
of
rocks
had
been
emptied
out
there
there
was
no
vegetation
on
this
sharp
promontory
which
projected
two
miles
from
the
forest
and
it
thus
represented
a
giants
arm
stretched
out
from
a
leafy
sleeve
the
canoe
impelled
by
the
two
oars
advanced
without
difficulty
gideon
spilett
pencil
in
one
hand
and
notebook
in
the
other
sketched
the
coast
in
bold
strokes
neb
herbert
and
pencroft
chatted
while
examining
this
part
of
their
domain
which
was
new
to
them
and
in
proportion
as
the
canoe
proceeded
towards
the
south
the
two
mandible
capes
appeared
to
move
and
surround
union
bay
more
closely
as
to
cyrus
harding
he
did
not
speak
he
simply
gazed
and
by
the
mistrust
which
his
look
expressed
it
appeared
that
he
was
examining
some
strange
country
in
the
meantime
after
a
voyage
of
threequarters
of
an
hour
the
canoe
reached
the
extremity
of
the
point
and
pencroft
was
preparing
to
return
when
herbert
rising
pointed
to
a
black
object
saying
what
do
i
see
down
there
on
the
beach
all
eyes
turned
towards
the
point
indicated
why
said
the
reporter
there
is
something
it
looks
like
part
of
a
wreck
half
buried
in
the
sand
ah
cried
pencroft
i
see
what
it
is
what
asked
neb
barrels
barrels
which
perhaps
are
full
replied
the
sailor
pull
to
the
shore
pencroft
said
cyrus
a
few
strokes
of
the
oar
brought
the
canoe
into
a
little
creek
and
its
passengers
leaped
on
shore
pencroft
was
not
mistaken
two
barrels
were
there
half
buried
in
the
sand
but
still
firmly
attached
to
a
large
chest
which
sustained
by
them
had
floated
to
the
moment
when
it
stranded
on
the
beach
there
has
been
a
wreck
then
in
some
part
of
the
island
said
herbert
evidently
replied
spilett
but
whats
in
this
chest
cried
pencroft
with
very
natural
impatience
whats
in
this
chest
it
is
shut
up
and
nothing
to
open
it
with
well
perhaps
a
stone
and
the
sailor
raising
a
heavy
block
was
about
to
break
in
one
of
the
sides
of
the
chest
when
the
engineer
arrested
his
hand
pencroft
said
he
can
you
restrain
your
impatience
for
one
hour
only
but
captain
just
think
perhaps
there
is
everything
we
want
in
there
we
shall
find
that
out
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
but
trust
to
me
and
do
not
break
the
chest
which
may
be
useful
to
us
we
must
convey
it
to
granite
house
where
we
can
open
it
easily
and
without
breaking
it
it
is
quite
prepared
for
a
voyage
and
since
it
has
floated
here
it
may
just
as
well
float
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
you
are
right
captain
and
i
was
wrong
as
usual
replied
the
sailor
the
engineers
advice
was
good
in
fact
the
canoe
probably
would
not
have
been
able
to
contain
the
articles
possibly
enclosed
in
the
chest
which
doubtless
was
heavy
since
two
empty
barrels
were
required
to
buoy
it
up
it
was
therefore
much
better
to
tow
it
to
the
beach
at
granite
house
and
now
whence
had
this
chest
come
that
was
the
important
question
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
looked
attentively
around
them
and
examined
the
shore
for
several
hundred
steps
no
other
articles
or
pieces
of
wreck
could
be
found
herbert
and
neb
climbed
a
high
rock
to
survey
the
sea
but
there
was
nothing
in
sightneither
a
dismasted
vessel
nor
a
ship
under
sail
however
there
was
no
doubt
that
there
had
been
a
wreck
perhaps
this
incident
was
connected
with
that
of
the
bullet
perhaps
strangers
had
landed
on
another
part
of
the
island
perhaps
they
were
still
there
but
the
thought
which
came
naturally
to
the
settlers
was
that
these
strangers
could
not
be
malay
pirates
for
the
chest
was
evidently
of
american
or
european
make
all
the
party
returned
to
the
chest
which
was
of
an
unusually
large
size
it
was
made
of
oak
wood
very
carefully
closed
and
covered
with
a
thick
hide
which
was
secured
by
copper
nails
the
two
great
barrels
hermetically
sealed
but
which
sounded
hollow
and
empty
were
fastened
to
its
sides
by
strong
ropes
knotted
with
a
skill
which
pencroft
directly
pronounced
sailors
alone
could
exhibit
it
appeared
to
be
in
a
perfect
state
of
preservation
which
was
explained
by
the
fact
that
it
had
stranded
on
a
sandy
beach
and
not
among
rocks
they
had
no
doubt
whatever
on
examining
it
carefully
that
it
had
not
been
long
in
the
water
and
that
its
arrival
on
this
coast
was
recent
the
water
did
not
appear
to
have
penetrated
to
the
inside
and
the
articles
which
it
contained
were
no
doubt
uninjured
it
was
evident
that
this
chest
had
been
thrown
overboard
from
some
dismasted
vessel
driven
towards
the
island
and
that
in
the
hope
that
it
would
reach
the
land
where
they
might
afterwards
find
it
the
passengers
had
taken
the
precaution
to
buoy
it
up
by
means
of
this
floating
apparatus
we
will
tow
this
chest
to
granite
house
said
the
engineer
where
we
can
make
an
inventory
of
its
contents
then
if
we
discover
any
of
the
survivors
from
the
supposed
wreck
we
can
return
it
to
those
to
whom
it
belongs
if
we
find
no
one
we
will
keep
it
for
ourselves
cried
pencroft
but
what
in
the
world
can
there
be
in
it
the
sea
was
already
approaching
the
chest
and
the
high
tide
would
evidently
float
it
one
of
the
ropes
which
fastened
the
barrels
was
partly
unlashed
and
used
as
a
cable
to
unite
the
floating
apparatus
with
the
canoe
pencroft
and
neb
then
dug
away
the
sand
with
their
oars
so
as
to
facilitate
the
moving
of
the
chest
towing
which
the
boat
soon
began
to
double
the
point
to
which
the
name
of
flotsam
point
was
given
the
chest
was
heavy
and
the
barrels
were
scarcely
sufficient
to
keep
it
above
water
the
sailor
also
feared
every
instant
that
it
would
get
loose
and
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
happily
his
fears
were
not
realized
and
an
hour
and
a
half
after
they
set
outall
that
time
had
been
taken
up
in
going
a
distance
of
three
milesthe
boat
touched
the
beach
below
granite
house
canoe
and
chest
were
then
hauled
up
on
the
sands
and
as
the
tide
was
then
going
out
they
were
soon
left
high
and
dry
neb
hurrying
home
brought
back
some
tools
with
which
to
open
the
chest
in
such
a
way
that
it
might
be
injured
as
little
as
possible
and
they
proceeded
to
its
inventory
pencroft
did
not
try
to
hide
that
he
was
greatly
excited
the
sailor
began
by
detaching
the
two
barrels
which
being
in
good
condition
would
of
course
be
of
use
then
the
locks
were
forced
with
a
cold
chisel
and
hammer
and
the
lid
thrown
back
a
second
casing
of
zinc
lined
the
interior
of
the
chest
which
had
been
evidently
arranged
that
the
articles
which
it
enclosed
might
under
any
circumstances
be
sheltered
from
damp
oh
cried
neb
suppose
its
jam
i
hope
not
replied
the
reporter
if
only
there
was
said
the
sailor
in
a
low
voice
what
asked
neb
who
overheard
him
nothing
the
covering
of
zinc
was
torn
off
and
thrown
back
over
the
sides
of
the
chest
and
by
degrees
numerous
articles
of
very
varied
character
were
produced
and
strewn
about
on
the
sand
at
each
new
object
pencroft
uttered
fresh
hurrahs
herbert
clapped
his
hands
and
neb
danced
up
and
down
there
were
books
which
made
herbert
wild
with
joy
and
cooking
utensils
which
neb
covered
with
kisses
in
short
the
colonists
had
reason
to
be
extremely
satisfied
for
this
chest
contained
tools

said
the

after

had

made
that
the

of

and
had
prepared
for
it
beforehand
nothing
is
wanting
indeed
murmured
cyrus
harding
thoughtfully
and
for
a
certainty
added
herbert
the
vessel
which
carried
this
chest
and
its
owner
was
not
a
malay
pirate
unless
said
pencroft
the
owner
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
pirates
that
is
not
admissible
replied
the
reporter
it
is
more
probable
that
an
american
or
european
vessel
has
been
driven
into
this
quarter
and
that
her
passengers
wishing
to
save
necessaries
at
least
prepared
this
chest
and
threw
it
overboard
is
that
your
opinion
captain
asked
herbert
yes
my
boy
replied
the
engineer
that
may
have
been
the
case
it
is
possible
that
at
the
moment
or
in
expectation
of
a
wreck
they
collected
into
this
chest
different
articles
of
the
greatest
use
in
hopes
of
finding
it
again
on
the
coast
even
the
photographic
box
exclaimed
the
sailor
incredulously
as
to
that
apparatus
replied
harding
i
do
not
quite
see
the
use
of
it
and
a
more
complete
supply
of
clothes
or
more
abundant
ammunition
would
have
been
more
valuable
to
us
as
well
as
to
any
other
castaways
but
isnt
there
any
mark
or
direction
on
these
instruments
tools
or
books
which
would
tell
us
something
about
them
asked
gideon
spilett
that
might
be
ascertained
each
article
was
carefully
examined
especially
the
books
instruments
and
weapons
neither
the
weapons
nor
the
instruments
contrary
to
the
usual
custom
bore
the
name
of
the
maker
they
were
besides
in
a
perfect
state
and
did
not
appear
to
have
been
used
the
same
peculiarity
marked
the
tools
and
utensils
all
were
new
which
proved
that
the
articles
had
not
been
taken
by
chance
and
thrown
into
the
chest
but
on
the
contrary
that
the
choice
of
things
had
been
well
considered
and
arranged
with
care
this
was
also
indicated
by
the
second
case
of
metal
which
had
preserved
them
from
damp
and
which
could
not
have
been
soldered
in
a
moment
of
haste
as
to
the
dictionaries
of
natural
science
and
polynesian
idioms
both
were
english
but
they
neither
bore
the
name
of
the
publisher
nor
the
date
of
publication
the
same
with
the
bible
printed
in
english
in
quarto
remarkable
from
a
typographic
point
of
view
and
which
appeared
to
have
been
often
used
the
atlas
was
a
magnificent
work
comprising
maps
of
every
country
in
the
world
and
several
planispheres
arranged
upon
mercators
projection
and
of
which
the
nomenclature
was
in
frenchbut
which
also
bore
neither
date
nor
name
of
publisher
there
was
nothing
therefore
on
these
different
articles
by
which
they
could
be
traced
and
nothing
consequently
of
a
nature
to
show
the
nationality
of
the
vessel
which
must
have
recently
passed
these
shores
but
wherever
the
chest
might
have
come
from
it
was
a
treasure
to
the
settlers
on
lincoln
island
till
then
by
making
use
of
the
productions
of
nature
they
had
created
everything
for
themselves
and
thanks
to
their
intelligence
they
had
managed
without
difficulty
but
did
it
not
appear
as
if
providence
had
wished
to
reward
them
by
sending
them
these
productions
of
human
industry
their
thanks
rose
unanimously
to
heaven
however
one
of
them
was
not
quite
satisfied
it
was
pencroft
it
appeared
that
the
chest
did
not
contain
something
which
he
evidently
held
in
great
esteem
for
in
proportion
as
they
approached
the
bottom
of
the
box
his
hurrahs
diminished
in
heartiness
and
the
inventory
finished
he
was
heard
to
mutter
these
wordsthats
all
very
fine
but
you
can
see
that
there
is
nothing
for
me
in
that
box
this
led
neb
to
say
why
friend
pencroft
what
more
do
you
expect
half
a
pound
of
tobacco
replied
pencroft
seriously
and
nothing
would
have
been
wanting
to
complete
my
happiness
no
one
could
help
laughing
at
this
speech
of
the
sailors
but
the
result
of
this
discovery
of
the
chest
was
that
it
was
now
more
than
ever
necessary
to
explore
the
island
thoroughly
it
was
therefore
agreed
that
the
next
morning
at
break
of
day
they
should
set
out
by
ascending
the
mercy
so
as
to
reach
the
western
shore
if
any
castaways
had
landed
on
the
coast
it
was
to
be
feared
they
were
without
resources
and
it
was
therefore
the
more
necessary
to
carry
help
to
them
without
delay
during
the
day
the
different
articles
were
carried
to
granite
house
where
they
were
methodically
arranged
in
the
great
hall
this
daythe
29th
of
octoberhappened
to
be
a
sunday
and
before
going
to
bed
herbert
asked
the
engineer
if
he
would
not
read
them
something
from
the
gospel
willingly
replied
cyrus
harding
he
took
the
sacred
volume
and
was
about
to
open
it
when
pencroft
stopped
him
sayingcaptain
i
am
superstitious
open
at
random
and
read
the
first
verse
which
your
eye
falls
upon
we
will
see
if
it
applies
to
our
situation
cyrus
harding
smiled
at
the
sailors
idea
and
yielding
to
his
wish
he
opened
exactly
at
a
place
where
the
leaves
were
separated
by
a
marker
immediately
his
eyes
were
attracted
by
a
cross
which
made
with
a
pencil
was
placed
against
the
eighth
verse
of
the
seventh
chapter
of
the
gospel
of
st
matthew
he
read
the
verse
which
was
this
for
every
one
that
asketh
receiveth
and
he
that
seeketh
findeth
chapter
3
the
next
day
the
30th
of
october
all
was
ready
for
the
proposed
exploring
expedition
which
recent
events
had
rendered
so
necessary
in
fact
things
had
so
come
about
that
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
no
longer
needed
help
for
themselves
but
were
even
able
to
carry
it
to
others
it
was
therefore
agreed
that
they
should
ascend
the
mercy
as
far
as
the
river
was
navigable
a
great
part
of
the
distance
would
thus
be
traversed
without
fatigue
and
the
explorers
could
transport
their
provisions
and
arms
to
an
advanced
point
in
the
west
of
the
island
it
was
necessary
to
think
not
only
of
the
things
which
they
should
take
with
them
but
also
of
those
which
they
might
have
by
chance
to
bring
back
to
granite
house
if
there
had
been
a
wreck
on
the
coast
as
was
supposed
there
would
be
many
things
cast
up
which
would
be
lawfully
their
prizes
in
the
event
of
this
the
cart
would
have
been
of
more
use
than
the
light
canoe
but
it
was
heavy
and
clumsy
to
drag
and
therefore
more
difficult
to
use
this
led
pencroft
to
express
his
regret
that
the
chest
had
not
contained
besides
his
halfpound
of
tobacco
a
pair
of
strong
new
jersey
horses
which
would
have
been
very
useful
to
the
colony
the
provisions
which
neb
had
already
packed
up
consisted
of
a
store
of
meat
and
of
several
gallons
of
beer
that
is
to
say
enough
to
sustain
them
for
three
days
the
time
which
harding
assigned
for
the
expedition
they
hoped
besides
to
supply
themselves
on
the
road
and
neb
took
care
not
to
forget
the
portable
stove
the
only
tools
the
settlers
took
were
the
two
woodmens
axes
which
they
could
use
to
cut
a
path
through
the
thick
forests
as
also
the
instruments
the
telescope
and
pocketcompass
for
weapons
they
selected
the
two
flintlock
guns
which
were
likely
to
be
more
useful
to
them
than
the
percussion
fowlingpieces
the
first
only
requiring
flints
which
could
be
easily
replaced
and
the
latter
needing
fulminating
caps
a
frequent
use
of
which
would
soon
exhaust
their
limited
stock
however
they
took
also
one
of
the
carbines
and
some
cartridges
as
to
the
powder
of
which
there
was
about
fifty
pounds
in
the
barrel
a
small
supply
of
it
had
to
be
taken
but
the
engineer
hoped
to
manufacture
an
explosive
substance
which
would
allow
them
to
husband
it
to
the
firearms
were
added
the
five
cutlasses
well
sheathed
in
leather
and
thus
supplied
the
settlers
could
venture
into
the
vast
forest
with
some
chance
of
success
it
is
useless
to
add
that
pencroft
herbert
and
neb
thus
armed
were
at
the
summit
of
their
happiness
although
cyrus
harding
made
them
promise
not
to
fire
a
shot
unless
it
was
necessary
at
six
in
the
morning
the
canoe
put
off
from
the
shore
all
had
embarked
including
top
and
they
proceeded
to
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
the
tide
had
begun
to
come
up
half
an
hour
before
for
several
hours
therefore
there
would
be
a
current
which
it
was
well
to
profit
by
for
later
the
ebb
would
make
it
difficult
to
ascend
the
river
the
tide
was
already
strong
for
in
three
days
the
moon
would
be
full
and
it
was
enough
to
keep
the
boat
in
the
center
of
the
current
where
it
floated
swiftly
along
between
the
high
banks
without
its
being
necessary
to
increase
its
speed
by
the
aid
of
the
oars
in
a
few
minutes
the
explorers
arrived
at
the
angle
formed
by
the
mercy
and
exactly
at
the
place
where
seven
months
before
pencroft
had
made
his
first
raft
of
wood
after
this
sudden
angle
the
river
widened
and
flowed
under
the
shade
of
great
evergreen
firs
the
aspect
of
the
banks
was
magnificent
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
could
not
but
admire
the
lovely
effects
so
easily
produced
by
nature
with
water
and
trees
as
they
advanced
the
forest
element
diminished
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
grew
magnificent
specimens
of
the
ulmaceae
tribe
the
precious
elm
so
valuable
to
builders
and
which
withstands
well
the
action
of
water
then
there
were
numerous
groups
belonging
to
the
same
family
among
others
one
in
particular
the
fruit
of
which
produces
a
very
useful
oil
further
on
herbert
remarked
the
lardizabala
a
twining
shrub
which
when
bruised
in
water
furnishes
excellent
cordage
and
two
or
three
ebony
trees
of
a
beautiful
black
crossed
with
capricious
veins
from
time
to
time
in
certain
places
where
the
landing
was
easy
the
canoe
was
stopped
when
gideon
spilett
herbert
and
pencroft
their
guns
in
their
hands
and
preceded
by
top
jumped
on
shore
without
expecting
game
some
useful
plant
might
be
met
with
and
the
young
naturalist
was
delighted
with
discovering
a
sort
of
wild
spinach
belonging
to
the
order
of
chenopodiaceae
and
numerous
specimens
of
cruciferae
belonging
to
the
cabbage
tribe
which
it
would
certainly
be
possible
to
cultivate
by
transplanting
there
were
cresses
horseradish
turnips
and
lastly
little
branching
hairy
stalks
scarcely
more
than
three
feet
high
which
produced
brownish
grains
do
you
know
what
this
plant
is
asked
herbert
of
the
sailor
tobacco
cried
pencroft
who
evidently
had
never
seen
his
favorite
plant
except
in
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
no
pencroft
replied
herbert
this
is
not
tobacco
it
is
mustard
mustard
be
hanged
returned
the
sailor
but
if
by
chance
you
happen
to
come
across
a
tobaccoplant
my
boy
pray
dont
scorn
that
we
shall
find
it
some
day
said
gideon
spilett
well
exclaimed
pencroft
when
that
day
comes
i
do
not
know
what
more
will
be
wanting
in
our
island
these
different
plants
which
had
been
carefully
rooted
up
were
carried
to
the
canoe
where
cyrus
harding
had
remained
buried
in
thought
the
reporter
herbert
and
pencroft
in
this
manner
frequently
disembarked
sometimes
on
the
right
bank
sometimes
on
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
the
latter
was
less
abrupt
but
the
former
more
wooded
the
engineer
ascertained
by
consulting
his
pocketcompass
that
the
direction
of
the
river
from
the
first
turn
was
obviously
southwest
and
northeast
and
nearly
straight
for
a
length
of
about
three
miles
but
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
this
direction
changed
beyond
that
point
and
that
the
mercy
continued
to
the
northwest
towards
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
among
which
the
river
rose
during
one
of
these
excursions
gideon
spilett
managed
to
get
hold
of
two
couples
of
living
gallinaceae
they
were
birds
with
long
thin
beaks
lengthened
necks
short
wings
and
without
any
appearance
of
a
tail
herbert
rightly
gave
them
the
name
of
tinamous
and
it
was
resolved
that
they
should
be
the
first
tenants
of
their
future
poultryyard
but
till
then
the
guns
had
not
spoken
and
the
first
report
which
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
forest
of
the
far
west
was
provoked
by
the
appearance
of
a
beautiful
bird
resembling
the
kingfisher
i
recognize
him
cried
pencroft
and
it
seemed
as
if
his
gun
went
off
by
itself
what
do
you
recognize
asked
the
reporter
the
bird
which
escaped
us
on
our
first
excursion
and
from
which
we
gave
the
name
to
that
part
of
the
forest
a
jacamar
cried
herbert
it
was
indeed
a
jacamar
of
which
the
plumage
shines
with
a
metallic
luster
a
shot
brought
it
to
the
ground
and
top
carried
it
to
the
canoe
at
the
same
time
half
a
dozen
lories
were
brought
down
the
lory
is
of
the
size
of
a
pigeon
the
plumage
dashed
with
green
part
of
the
wings
crimson
and
its
crest
bordered
with
white
to
the
young
boy
belonged
the
honor
of
this
shot
and
he
was
proud
enough
of
it
lories
are
better
food
than
the
jacamar
the
flesh
of
which
is
rather
tough
but
it
was
difficult
to
persuade
pencroft
that
he
had
not
killed
the
king
of
eatable
birds
it
was
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
when
the
canoe
reached
a
second
angle
of
the
mercy
nearly
five
miles
from
its
mouth
here
a
halt
was
made
for
breakfast
under
the
shade
of
some
splendid
trees
the
river
still
measured
from
sixty
to
seventy
feet
in
breadth
and
its
bed
from
five
to
six
feet
in
depth
the
engineer
had
observed
that
it
was
increased
by
numerous
affluents
but
they
were
unnavigable
being
simply
little
streams
as
to
the
forest
including
jacamar
wood
as
well
as
the
forests
of
the
far
west
it
extended
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
in
no
place
either
in
the
depths
of
the
forests
or
under
the
trees
on
the
banks
of
the
mercy
was
the
presence
of
man
revealed
the
explorers
could
not
discover
one
suspicious
trace
it
was
evident
that
the
woodmans
axe
had
never
touched
these
trees
that
the
pioneers
knife
had
never
severed
the
creepers
hanging
from
one
trunk
to
another
in
the
midst
of
tangled
brushwood
and
long
grass
if
castaways
had
landed
on
the
island
they
could
not
have
yet
quitted
the
shore
and
it
was
not
in
the
woods
that
the
survivors
of
the
supposed
shipwreck
should
be
sought
the
engineer
therefore
manifested
some
impatience
to
reach
the
western
coast
of
lincoln
island
which
was
at
least
five
miles
distant
according
to
his
estimation
the
voyage
was
continued
and
as
the
mercy
appeared
to
flow
not
towards
the
shore
but
rather
towards
mount
franklin
it
was
decided
that
they
should
use
the
boat
as
long
as
there
was
enough
water
under
its
keel
to
float
it
it
was
both
fatigue
spared
and
time
gained
for
they
would
have
been
obliged
to
cut
a
path
through
the
thick
wood
with
their
axes
but
soon
the
flow
completely
failed
them
either
the
tide
was
going
down
and
it
was
about
the
hour
or
it
could
no
longer
be
felt
at
this
distance
from
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
they
had
therefore
to
make
use
of
the
oars
herbert
and
neb
each
took
one
and
pencroft
took
the
scull
the
forest
soon
became
less
dense
the
trees
grew
further
apart
and
often
quite
isolated
but
the
further
they
were
from
each
other
the
more
magnificent
they
appeared
profiting
as
they
did
by
the
free
pure
air
which
circulated
around
them
what
splendid
specimens
of
the
flora
of
this
latitude
certainly
their
presence
would
have
been
enough
for
a
botanist
to
name
without
hesitation
the
parallel
which
traversed
lincoln
island
eucalypti
cried
herbert
they
were
in
fact
those
splendid
trees
the
giants
of
the
extratropical
zone
the
congeners
of
the
australian
and
new
zealand
eucalyptus
both
situated
under
the
same
latitude
as
lincoln
island
some
rose
to
a
height
of
two
hundred
feet
their
trunks
at
the
base
measured
twenty
feet
in
circumference
and
their
bark
was
covered
by
a
network
of
farrows
containing
a
red
sweetsmelling
gum
nothing
is
more
wonderful
or
more
singular
than
those
enormous
specimens
of
the
order
of
the
myrtaceae
with
their
leaves
placed
vertically
and
not
horizontally
so
that
an
edge
and
not
a
surface
looks
upwards
the
effect
being
that
the
suns
rays
penetrate
more
freely
among
the
trees
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
eucalypti
was
carpeted
with
grass
and
from
the
bushes
escaped
flights
of
little
birds
which
glittered
in
the
sunlight
like
winged
rubies
these
are
something
like
trees
cried
neb
but
are
they
good
for
anything
pooh
replied
pencroft
of
course
there
are
vegetable
giants
as
well
as
human
giants
and
they
are
no
good
except
to
show
themselves
at
fairs
i
think
that
you
are
mistaken
pencroft
replied
gideon
spilett
and
that
the
wood
of
the
eucalyptus
has
begun
to
be
very
advantageously
employed
in
cabinetmaking
and
i
may
add
said
herbert
that
the
eucalyptus
belongs
to
a
family
which
comprises
many
useful
members
the
guavatree
from
whose
fruit
guava
jelly
is
made
the
clovetree
which
produces
the
spice
the
pomegranatetree
which
bears
pomegranates
the
eugeacia
cauliflora
the
fruit
of
which
is
used
in
making
a
tolerable
wine
the
ugui
myrtle
which
contains
an
excellent
alcoholic
liquor
the
caryophyllus
myrtle
of
which
the
bark
forms
an
esteemed
cinnamon
the
eugenia
pimenta
from
whence
comes
jamaica
pepper
the
common
myrtle
from
whose
buds
and
berries
spice
is
sometimes
made
the
eucalyptus
manifera
which
yields
a
sweet
sort
of
manna
the
guinea
eucalyptus
the
sap
of
which
is
transformed
into
beer
by
fermentation
in
short
all
those
trees
known
under
the
name
of
gumtrees
or
ironbark
trees
in
australia
belong
to
this
family
of
the
myrtaceae
which
contains
fortysix
genera
and
thirteen
hundred
species
the
lad
was
allowed
to
run
on
and
he
delivered
his
little
botanical
lecture
with
great
animation
cyrus
harding
listened
smiling
and
pencroft
with
an
indescribable
feeling
of
pride
very
good
herbert
replied
pencroft
but
i
could
swear
that
all
those
useful
specimens
you
have
just
told
us
about
are
none
of
them
giants
like
these
that
is
true
pencroft
that
supports
what
i
said
returned
the
sailor
namely
that
these
giants
are
good
for
nothing
there
you
are
wrong
pencroft
said
the
engineer
these
gigantic
eucalypti
which
shelter
us
are
good
for
something
and
what
is
that
to
render
the
countries
which
they
inhabit
healthy
do
you
know
what
they
are
called
in
australia
and
new
zealand
no
captain
they
are
called
fever
trees
because
they
give
fevers
no
because
they
prevent
them
good
i
must
note
that
said
the
reporter
note
it
then
my
dear
spilett
for
it
appears
proved
that
the
presence
of
the
eucalyptus
is
enough
to
neutralize
miasmas
this
natural
antidote
has
been
tried
in
certain
countries
in
the
middle
of
europe
and
the
north
of
africa
where
the
soil
was
absolutely
unhealthy
and
the
sanitary
condition
of
the
inhabitants
has
been
gradually
ameliorated
no
more
intermittent
fevers
prevail
in
the
regions
now
covered
with
forests
of
the
myrtaceae
this
fact
is
now
beyond
doubt
and
it
is
a
happy
circumstance
for
us
settlers
in
lincoln
island
ah
what
an
island
what
a
blessed
island
cried
pencroft
i
tell
you
it
wants
nothingunless
it
is
that
will
come
pencroft
that
will
be
found
replied
the
engineer
but
now
we
must
continue
our
voyage
and
push
on
as
far
as
the
river
will
carry
our
boat
the
exploration
was
therefore
continued
for
another
two
miles
in
the
midst
of
country
covered
with
eucalypti
which
predominated
in
the
woods
of
this
portion
of
the
island
the
space
which
they
occupied
extended
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
on
each
side
of
the
mercy
which
wound
along
between
high
green
banks
the
bed
was
often
obstructed
by
long
weeds
and
even
by
pointed
rocks
which
rendered
the
navigation
very
difficult
the
action
of
the
oars
was
prevented
and
pencroft
was
obliged
to
push
with
a
pole
they
found
also
that
the
water
was
becoming
shallower
and
shallower
and
that
the
canoe
must
soon
stop
the
sun
was
already
sinking
towards
the
horizon
and
the
trees
threw
long
shadows
on
the
ground
cyrus
harding
seeing
that
he
could
not
hope
to
reach
the
western
coast
of
the
island
in
one
journey
resolved
to
camp
at
the
place
where
any
further
navigation
was
prevented
by
want
of
water
he
calculated
that
they
were
still
five
or
six
miles
from
the
coast
and
this
distance
was
too
great
for
them
to
attempt
during
the
night
in
the
midst
of
unknown
woods
the
boat
was
pushed
on
through
the
forest
which
gradually
became
thicker
again
and
appeared
also
to
have
more
inhabitants
for
if
the
eyes
of
the
sailor
did
not
deceive
him
he
thought
he
saw
bands
of
monkeys
springing
among
the
trees
sometimes
even
two
or
three
of
these
animals
stopped
at
a
little
distance
from
the
canoe
and
gazed
at
the
settlers
without
manifesting
any
terror
as
if
seeing
men
for
the
first
time
they
had
not
yet
learned
to
fear
them
it
would
have
been
easy
to
bring
down
one
of
these
quadramani
with
a
gunshot
and
pencroft
was
greatly
tempted
to
fire
but
harding
opposed
so
useless
a
massacre
this
was
prudent
for
the
monkeys
or
apes
rather
appearing
to
be
very
powerful
and
extremely
active
it
was
useless
to
provoke
an
unnecessary
aggression
and
the
creatures
might
ignorant
of
the
power
of
the
explorers
firearms
have
attacked
them
it
is
true
that
the
sailor
considered
the
monkeys
from
a
purely
alimentary
point
of
view
for
those
animals
which
are
herbivorous
make
very
excellent
game
but
since
they
had
an
abundant
supply
of
provisions
it
was
a
pity
to
waste
their
ammunition
towards
four
oclock
the
navigation
of
the
mercy
became
exceedingly
difficult
for
its
course
was
obstructed
by
aquatic
plants
and
rocks
the
banks
rose
higher
and
higher
and
already
they
were
approaching
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
the
source
could
not
be
far
off
since
it
was
fed
by
the
water
from
the
southern
slopes
of
the
mountain
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
said
the
sailor
we
shall
be
obliged
to
stop
captain
very
well
we
will
stop
pencroft
and
we
will
make
our
encampment
for
the
night
at
what
distance
are
we
from
granite
house
asked
herbert
about
seven
miles
replied
the
engineer
taking
into
calculation
however
the
detours
of
the
river
which
has
carried
us
to
the
northwest
shall
we
go
on
asked
the
reporter
yes
as
long
as
we
can
replied
cyrus
harding
tomorrow
at
break
of
day
we
will
leave
the
canoe
and
in
two
hours
i
hope
we
shall
cross
the
distance
which
separates
us
from
the
coast
and
then
we
shall
have
the
whole
day
in
which
to
explore
the
shore
go
ahead
replied
pencroft
but
soon
the
boat
grated
on
the
stony
bottom
of
the
river
which
was
now
not
more
than
twenty
feet
in
breadth
the
trees
met
like
a
bower
overhead
and
caused
a
halfdarkness
they
also
heard
the
noise
of
a
waterfall
which
showed
that
a
few
hundred
feet
up
the
river
there
was
a
natural
barrier
presently
after
a
sudden
turn
of
the
river
a
cascade
appeared
through
the
trees
the
canoe
again
touched
the
bottom
and
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
moored
to
a
trunk
near
the
right
bank
it
was
nearly
five
oclock
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
gleamed
through
the
thick
foliage
and
glanced
on
the
little
waterfall
making
the
spray
sparkle
with
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
beyond
that
the
mercy
was
lost
in
the
bushwood
where
it
was
fed
from
some
hidden
source
the
different
streams
which
flowed
into
it
increased
it
to
a
regular
river
further
down
but
here
it
was
simply
a
shallow
limpid
brook
it
was
agreed
to
camp
here
as
the
place
was
charming
the
colonists
disembarked
and
a
fire
was
soon
lighted
under
a
clump
of
trees
among
the
branches
of
which
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
could
if
it
was
necessary
take
refuge
for
the
night
supper
was
quickly
devoured
for
they
were
very
hungry
and
then
there
was
only
sleeping
to
think
of
but
as
roarings
of
rather
a
suspicious
nature
had
been
heard
during
the
evening
a
good
fire
was
made
up
for
the
night
so
as
to
protect
the
sleepers
with
its
crackling
flames
neb
and
pencroft
also
watched
by
turns
and
did
not
spare
fuel
they
thought
they
saw
the
dark
forms
of
some
wild
animals
prowling
round
the
camp
among
the
bushes
but
the
night
passed
without
incident
and
the
next
day
the
31st
of
october
at
five
oclock
in
the
morning
all
were
on
foot
ready
for
a
start
chapter
4
it
was
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
the
settlers
after
a
hasty
breakfast
set
out
to
reach
by
the
shortest
way
the
western
coast
of
the
island
and
how
long
would
it
take
to
do
this
cyrus
harding
had
said
two
hours
but
of
course
that
depended
on
the
nature
of
the
obstacles
they
might
meet
with
as
it
was
probable
that
they
would
have
to
cut
a
path
through
the
grass
shrubs
and
creepers
they
marched
axe
in
hand
and
with
guns
also
ready
wisely
taking
warning
from
the
cries
of
the
wild
beasts
heard
in
the
night
the
exact
position
of
the
encampment
could
be
determined
by
the
bearing
of
mount
franklin
and
as
the
volcano
arose
in
the
north
at
a
distance
of
less
than
three
miles
they
had
only
to
go
straight
towards
the
southwest
to
reach
the
western
coast
they
set
out
having
first
carefully
secured
the
canoe
pencroft
and
neb
carried
sufficient
provision
for
the
little
band
for
at
least
two
days
it
would
not
thus
be
necessary
to
hunt
the
engineer
advised
his
companions
to
refrain
from
firing
that
their
presence
might
not
be
betrayed
to
any
one
near
the
shore
the
first
hatchet
blows
were
given
among
the
brushwood
in
the
midst
of
some
mastictrees
a
little
above
the
cascade
and
his
compass
in
his
hand
cyrus
harding
led
the
way
the
forest
here
was
composed
for
the
most
part
of
trees
which
had
already
been
met
with
near
the
lake
and
on
prospect
heights
there
were
deodars
douglas
firs
casuarinas
gum
trees
eucalypti
hibiscus
cedars
and
other
trees
generally
of
a
moderate
size
for
their
number
prevented
their
growth
since
their
departure
the
settlers
had
descended
the
slopes
which
constituted
the
mountain
system
of
the
island
on
to
a
dry
soil
but
the
luxuriant
vegetation
of
which
indicated
it
to
be
watered
either
by
some
subterranean
marsh
or
by
some
stream
however
cyrus
harding
did
not
remember
having
seen
at
the
time
of
his
excursion
to
the
crater
any
other
watercourses
but
the
red
creek
and
the
mercy
during
the
first
part
of
their
excursion
they
saw
numerous
troops
of
monkeys
who
exhibited
great
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
men
whose
appearance
was
so
new
to
them
gideon
spilett
jokingly
asked
whether
these
active
and
merry
quadrupeds
did
not
consider
him
and
his
companions
as
degenerate
brothers
and
certainly
pedestrians
hindered
at
each
step
by
bushes
caught
by
creepers
barred
by
trunks
of
trees
did
not
shine
beside
those
supple
animals
who
bounding
from
branch
to
branch
were
hindered
by
nothing
on
their
course
the
monkeys
were
numerous
but
happily
they
did
not
manifest
any
hostile
disposition
several
pigs
agoutis
kangaroos
and
other
rodents
were
seen
also
two
or
three
koalas
at
which
pencroft
longed
to
have
a
shot
but
said
he
you
may
jump
and
play
just
now
we
shall
have
one
or
two
words
to
say
to
you
on
our
way
back
at
halfpast
nine
the
way
was
suddenly
found
to
be
barred
by
an
unknown
stream
from
thirty
to
forty
feet
broad
whose
rapid
current
dashed
foaming
over
the
numerous
rocks
which
interrupted
its
course
this
creek
was
deep
and
clear
but
it
was
absolutely
unnavigable
we
are
cut
off
cried
neb
no
replied
herbert
it
is
only
a
stream
and
we
can
easily
swim
over
what
would
be
the
use
of
that
returned
harding
this
creek
evidently
runs
to
the
sea
let
us
remain
on
this
side
and
follow
the
bank
and
i
shall
be
much
astonished
if
it
does
not
lead
us
very
quickly
to
the
coast
forward
one
minute
said
the
reporter
the
name
of
this
creek
my
friends
do
not
let
us
leave
our
geography
incomplete
all
right
said
pencroft
name
it
my
boy
said
the
engineer
addressing
the
lad
will
it
not
be
better
to
wait
until
we
have
explored
it
to
its
mouth
answered
herbert
very
well
replied
cyrus
harding
let
us
follow
it
as
fast
as
we
can
without
stopping
still
another
minute
said
pencroft
whats
the
matter
asked
the
reporter
though
hunting
is
forbidden
fishing
is
allowed
i
suppose
said
the
sailor
we
have
no
time
to
lose
replied
the
engineer
oh
five
minutes
replied
pencroft
i
only
ask
for
five
minutes
to
use
in
the
interest
of
our
breakfast
and
pencroft
lying
down
on
the
bank
plunged
his
arm
into
the
water
and
soon
pulled
up
several
dozen
of
fine
crayfish
from
among
the
stones
these
will
be
good
cried
neb
going
to
the
sailors
aid
as
i
said
there
is
everything
in
this
island
except
tobacco
muttered
pencroft
with
a
sigh
the
fishing
did
not
take
five
minutes
for
the
crayfish
were
swarming
in
the
creek
a
bag
was
filled
with
the
crustaceae
whose
shells
were
of
a
cobalt
blue
the
settlers
then
pushed
on
they
advanced
more
rapidly
and
easily
along
the
bank
of
the
river
than
in
the
forest
from
time
to
time
they
came
upon
the
traces
of
animals
of
a
large
size
who
had
come
to
quench
their
thirst
at
the
stream
but
none
were
actually
seen
and
it
was
evidently
not
in
this
part
of
the
forest
that
the
peccary
had
received
the
bullet
which
had
cost
pencroft
a
grinder
in
the
meanwhile
considering
the
rapid
current
harding
was
led
to
suppose
that
he
and
his
companions
were
much
farther
from
the
western
coast
than
they
had
at
first
supposed
in
fact
at
this
hour
the
rising
tide
would
have
turned
back
the
current
of
the
creek
if
its
mouth
had
only
been
a
few
miles
distant
now
this
effect
was
not
produced
and
the
water
pursued
its
natural
course
the
engineer
was
much
astonished
at
this
and
frequently
consulted
his
compass
to
assure
himself
that
some
turn
of
the
river
was
not
leading
them
again
into
the
far
west
however
the
creek
gradually
widened
and
its
waters
became
less
tumultuous
the
trees
on
the
right
bank
were
as
close
together
as
on
the
left
bank
and
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
anything
beyond
them
but
these
masses
of
wood
were
evidently
uninhabited
for
top
did
not
bark
and
the
intelligent
animal
would
not
have
failed
to
signal
the
presence
of
any
stranger
in
the
neighborhood
at
halfpast
ten
to
the
great
surprise
of
cyrus
harding
herbert
who
was
a
little
in
front
suddenly
stopped
and
exclaimed
the
sea
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
whole
western
shore
of
the
island
lay
extended
before
the
eyes
of
the
settlers
but
what
a
contrast
between
this
and
the
eastern
coast
upon
which
chance
had
first
thrown
them
no
granite
cliff
no
rocks
not
even
a
sandy
beach
the
forest
reached
the
shore
and
the
tall
trees
bending
over
the
water
were
beaten
by
the
waves
it
was
not
such
a
shore
as
is
usually
formed
by
nature
either
by
extending
a
vast
carpet
of
sand
or
by
grouping
masses
of
rock
but
a
beautiful
border
consisting
of
the
most
splendid
trees
the
bank
was
raised
a
little
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
on
this
luxuriant
soil
supported
by
a
granite
base
the
fine
forest
trees
seemed
to
be
as
firmly
planted
as
in
the
interior
of
the
island
the
colonists
were
then
on
the
shore
of
an
unimportant
little
harbor
which
would
scarcely
have
contained
even
two
or
three
fishingboats
it
served
as
a
neck
to
the
new
creek
of
which
the
curious
thing
was
that
its
waters
instead
of
joining
the
sea
by
a
gentle
slope
fell
from
a
height
of
more
than
forty
feet
which
explained
why
the
rising
tide
was
not
felt
up
the
stream
in
fact
the
tides
of
the
pacific
even
at
their
maximum
elevation
could
never
reach
the
level
of
the
river
and
doubtless
millions
of
years
would
pass
before
the
water
would
have
worn
away
the
granite
and
hollowed
a
practicable
mouth
it
was
settled
that
the
name
of
falls
river
should
be
given
to
this
stream
beyond
towards
the
north
the
forest
border
was
prolonged
for
a
space
of
nearly
two
miles
then
the
trees
became
scarcer
and
beyond
that
again
the
picturesque
heights
described
a
nearly
straight
line
which
ran
north
and
south
on
the
contrary
all
the
part
of
the
shore
between
falls
river
and
reptile
end
was
a
mass
of
wood
magnificent
trees
some
straight
others
bent
so
that
the
long
seaswell
bathed
their
roots
now
it
was
this
coast
that
is
all
the
serpentine
peninsula
that
was
to
be
explored
for
this
part
of
the
shore
offered
a
refuge
to
castaways
which
the
other
wild
and
barren
side
must
have
refused
the
weather
was
fine
and
clear
and
from
a
height
of
a
hillock
on
which
neb
and
pencroft
had
arranged
breakfast
a
wide
view
was
obtained
there
was
however
not
a
sail
in
sight
nothing
could
be
seen
along
the
shore
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
but
the
engineer
would
take
nothing
for
granted
until
he
had
explored
the
coast
to
the
very
extremity
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
breakfast
was
soon
despatched
and
at
halfpast
eleven
the
captain
gave
the
signal
for
departure
instead
of
proceeding
over
the
summit
of
a
cliff
or
along
a
sandy
beach
the
settlers
were
obliged
to
remain
under
cover
of
the
trees
so
that
they
might
continue
on
the
shore
the
distance
which
separated
falls
river
from
reptile
end
was
about
twelve
miles
it
would
have
taken
the
settlers
four
hours
to
do
this
on
a
clear
ground
and
without
hurrying
themselves
but
as
it
was
they
needed
double
the
time
for
what
with
trees
to
go
round
bushes
to
cut
down
and
creepers
to
chop
away
they
were
impeded
at
every
step
these
obstacles
greatly
lengthening
their
journey
there
was
however
nothing
to
show
that
a
shipwreck
had
taken
place
recently
it
is
true
that
as
gideon
spilett
observed
any
remains
of
it
might
have
drifted
out
to
sea
and
they
must
not
take
it
for
granted
that
because
they
could
find
no
traces
of
it
a
ship
had
not
been
castaway
on
the
coast
the
reporters
argument
was
just
and
besides
the
incident
of
the
bullet
proved
that
a
shot
must
have
been
fired
in
lincoln
island
within
three
months
it
was
already
five
oclock
and
there
were
still
two
miles
between
the
settlers
and
the
extremity
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
it
was
evident
that
after
having
reached
reptile
end
harding
and
his
companions
would
not
have
time
to
return
before
dark
to
their
encampment
near
the
source
of
the
mercy
it
would
therefore
be
necessary
to
pass
the
night
on
the
promontory
but
they
had
no
lack
of
provisions
which
was
lucky
for
there
were
no
animals
on
the
shore
though
birds
on
the
contrary
aboundjacamars
couroucous
tragopans
grouse
lories
parrots
cockatoos
pheasants
pigeons
and
a
hundred
others
there
was
not
a
tree
without
a
nest
and
not
a
nest
which
was
not
full
of
flapping
wings
towards
seven
oclock
the
weary
explorers
arrived
at
reptile
end
here
the
seaside
forest
ended
and
the
shore
resumed
the
customary
appearance
of
a
coast
with
rocks
reefs
and
sands
it
was
possible
that
something
might
be
found
here
but
darkness
came
on
and
the
further
exploration
had
to
be
put
off
to
the
next
day
pencroft
and
herbert
hastened
on
to
find
a
suitable
place
for
their
camp
among
the
last
trees
of
the
forest
of
the
far
west
the
boy
found
several
thick
clumps
of
bamboos
good
said
he
this
is
a
valuable
discovery
valuable
returned
pencroft
certainly
replied
herbert
i
may
say
pencroft
that
the
bark
of
the
bamboo
cut
into
flexible
laths
is
used
for
making
baskets
that
this
bark
mashed
into
a
paste
is
used
for
the
manufacture
of
chinese
paper
that
the
stalks
furnish
according
to
their
size
canes
and
pipes
and
are
used
for
conducting
water
that
large
bamboos
make
excellent
material
for
building
being
light
and
strong
and
being
never
attacked
by
insects
i
will
add
that
by
sawing
the
bamboo
in
two
at
the
joint
keeping
for
the
bottom
the
part
of
the
transverse
film
which
forms
the
joint
useful
cups
are
obtained
which
are
much
in
use
among
the
chinese
no
you
dont
care
for
that
but
but
what
but
i
can
tell
you
if
you
are
ignorant
of
it
that
in
india
these
bamboos
are
eaten
like
asparagus
asparagus
thirty
feet
high
exclaimed
the
sailor
and
are
they
good
excellent
replied
herbert
only
it
is
not
the
stems
of
thirty
feet
high
which
are
eaten
but
the
young
shoots
perfect
my
boy
perfect
replied
pencroft
i
will
also
add
that
the
pith
of
the
young
stalks
preserved
in
vinegar
makes
a
good
pickle
better
and
better
herbert
and
lastly
that
the
bamboos
exude
a
sweet
liquor
which
can
be
made
into
a
very
agreeable
drink
is
that
all
asked
the
sailor
that
is
all
and
they
dont
happen
to
do
for
smoking
no
my
poor
pencroft
herbert
and
the
sailor
had
not
to
look
long
for
a
place
in
which
to
pass
the
night
the
rocks
which
must
have
been
violently
beaten
by
the
sea
under
the
influence
of
the
winds
of
the
southwest
presented
many
cavities
in
which
shelter
could
be
found
against
the
night
air
but
just
as
they
were
about
to
enter
one
of
these
caves
a
loud
roaring
arrested
them
back
cried
pencroft
our
guns
are
only
loaded
with
small
shot
and
beasts
which
can
roar
as
loud
as
that
would
care
no
more
for
it
than
for
grains
of
salt
and
the
sailor
seizing
herbert
by
the
arm
dragged
him
behind
a
rock
just
as
a
magnificent
animal
showed
itself
at
the
entrance
of
the
cavern
it
was
a
jaguar
of
a
size
at
least
equal
to
its
asiatic
congeners
that
is
to
say
it
measured
five
feet
from
the
extremity
of
its
head
to
the
beginning
of
its
tail
the
yellow
color
of
its
hair
was
relieved
by
streaks
and
regular
oblong
spots
of
black
which
contrasted
with
the
white
of
its
chest
herbert
recognized
it
as
the
ferocious
rival
of
the
tiger
as
formidable
as
the
puma
which
is
the
rival
of
the
largest
wolf
the
jaguar
advanced
and
gazed
around
him
with
blazing
eyes
his
hair
bristling
as
if
this
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
scented
men
at
this
moment
the
reporter
appeared
round
a
rock
and
herbert
thinking
that
he
had
not
seen
the
jaguar
was
about
to
rush
towards
him
when
gideon
spilett
signed
to
him
to
remain
where
he
was
this
was
not
his
first
tiger
and
advancing
to
within
ten
feet
of
the
animal
he
remained
motionless
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
without
moving
a
muscle
the
jaguar
collected
itself
for
a
spring
but
at
that
moment
a
shot
struck
it
in
the
eyes
and
it
fell
dead
herbert
and
pencroft
rushed
towards
the
jaguar
neb
and
harding
also
ran
up
and
they
remained
for
some
instants
contemplating
the
animal
as
it
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
thinking
that
its
magnificent
skin
would
be
a
great
ornament
to
the
hall
at
granite
house
oh
mr
spilett
how
i
admire
and
envy
you
cried
herbert
in
a
fit
of
very
natural
enthusiasm
well
my
boy
replied
the
reporter
you
could
have
done
the
same
i
with
such
coolness
imagine
to
yourself
herbert
that
the
jaguar
is
only
a
hare
and
you
would
fire
as
quietly
as
possible
that
is
rejoined
pencroft
that
it
is
not
more
dangerous
than
a
hare
and
now
said
gideon
spilett
since
the
jaguar
has
left
its
abode
i
do
not
see
my
friends
why
we
should
not
take
possession
of
it
for
the
night
but
others
may
come
said
pencroft
it
will
be
enough
to
light
a
fire
at
the
entrance
of
the
cavern
said
the
reporter
and
no
wild
beasts
will
dare
to
cross
the
threshold
into
the
jaguars
house
then
replied
the
sailor
dragging
after
him
the
body
of
the
animal
while
neb
skinned
the
jaguar
his
companions
collected
an
abundant
supply
of
dry
wood
from
the
forest
which
they
heaped
up
at
the
cave
cyrus
harding
seeing
the
clump
of
bamboos
cut
a
quantity
which
he
mingled
with
the
other
fuel
this
done
they
entered
the
grotto
of
which
the
floor
was
strewn
with
bones
the
guns
were
carefully
loaded
in
case
of
a
sudden
attack
they
had
supper
and
then
just
before
they
lay
down
to
rest
the
heap
of
wood
piled
at
the
entrance
was
set
fire
to
immediately
a
regular
explosion
or
rather
a
series
of
reports
broke
the
silence
the
noise
was
caused
by
the
bamboos
which
as
the
flames
reached
them
exploded
like
fireworks
the
noise
was
enough
to
terrify
even
the
boldest
of
wild
beasts
it
was
not
the
engineer
who
had
invented
this
way
of
causing
loud
explosions

cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
slept
like
innocent
marmots
in
the
cave
which
the
jaguar
had
so
politely
left
at
their
disposal
at
sunrise
all
were
on
the
shore
at
the
extremity
of
the
promontory
and
their
gaze
was
directed
towards
the
horizon
of
which
twothirds
of
the
circumference
were
visible
for
the
last
time
the
engineer
could
ascertain
that
not
a
sail
nor
the
wreck
of
a
ship
was
on
the
sea
and
even
with
the
telescope
nothing
suspicious
could
be
discovered
there
was
nothing
either
on
the
shore
at
least
in
the
straight
line
of
three
miles
which
formed
the
south
side
of
the
promontory
for
beyond
that
rising
ground
had
the
rest
of
the
coast
and
even
from
the
extremity
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
claw
cape
could
not
be
seen
the
southern
coast
of
the
island
still
remained
to
be
explored
now
should
they
undertake
it
immediately
and
devote
this
day
to
it
this
was
not
included
in
their
first
plan
in
fact
when
the
boat
was
abandoned
at
the
sources
of
the
mercy
it
had
been
agreed
that
after
having
surveyed
the
west
coast
they
should
go
back
to
it
and
return
to
granite
house
by
the
mercy
harding
then
thought
that
the
western
coast
would
have
offered
refuge
either
to
a
ship
in
distress
or
to
a
vessel
in
her
regular
course
but
now
as
he
saw
that
this
coast
presented
no
good
anchorage
he
wished
to
seek
on
the
south
what
they
had
not
been
able
to
find
on
the
west
gideon
spilett
proposed
to
continue
the
exploration
that
the
question
of
the
supposed
wreck
might
be
completely
settled
and
he
asked
at
what
distance
claw
cape
might
be
from
the
extremity
of
the
peninsula
about
thirty
miles
replied
the
engineer
if
we
take
into
consideration
the
curvings
of
the
coast
thirty
miles
returned
spilett
that
would
be
a
long
days
march
nevertheless
i
think
that
we
should
return
to
granite
house
by
the
south
coast
but
observed
herbert
from
claw
cape
to
granite
house
there
must
be
at
least
another
ten
miles
make
it
forty
miles
in
all
replied
the
engineer
and
do
not
hesitate
to
do
it
at
least
we
should
survey
the
unknown
shore
and
then
we
shall
not
have
to
begin
the
exploration
again
very
good
said
pencroft
but
the
boat
the
boat
has
remained
by
itself
for
one
day
at
the
sources
of
the
mercy
replied
gideon
spilett
it
may
just
as
well
stay
there
two
days
as
yet
we
have
had
no
reason
to
think
that
the
island
is
infested
by
thieves
yet
said
the
sailor
when
i
remember
the
history
of
the
turtle
i
am
far
from
confident
of
that
the
turtle
the
turtle
replied
the
reporter
dont
you
know
that
the
sea
turned
it
over
who
knows
murmured
the
engineer
but
said
neb
neb
had
evidently
something
to
say
for
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
yet
said
nothing
what
do
you
want
to
say
neb
asked
the
engineer
if
we
return
by
the
shore
to
claw
cape
replied
neb
after
having
doubled
the
cape
we
shall
be
stopped
by
the
mercy
of
course
replied
herbert
and
we
shall
have
neither
bridge
nor
boat
by
which
to
cross
but
captain
added
pencroft
with
a
few
floating
trunks
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
crossing
the
river
never
mind
said
spilett
it
will
be
useful
to
construct
a
bridge
if
we
wish
to
have
an
easy
access
to
the
far
west
a
bridge
cried
pencroft
well
is
not
the
captain
the
best
engineer
in
his
profession
he
will
make
us
a
bridge
when
we
want
one
as
to
transporting
you
this
evening
to
the
other
side
of
the
mercy
and
that
without
wetting
one
thread
of
your
clothes
i
will
take
care
of
that
we
have
provisions
for
another
day
and
besides
we
can
get
plenty
of
game
forward
the
reporters
proposal
so
strongly
seconded
by
the
sailor
received
general
approbation
for
each
wished
to
have
their
doubts
set
at
rest
and
by
returning
by
claw
cape
the
exploration
would
be
ended
but
there
was
not
an
hour
to
lose
for
forty
miles
was
a
long
march
and
they
could
not
hope
to
reach
granite
house
before
night
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
the
little
band
set
out
as
a
precaution
the
guns
were
loaded
with
ball
and
top
who
led
the
van
received
orders
to
beat
about
the
edge
of
the
forest
from
the
extremity
of
the
promontory
which
formed
the
tail
of
the
peninsula
the
coast
was
rounded
for
a
distance
of
five
miles
which
was
rapidly
passed
over
without
even
the
most
minute
investigations
bringing
to
light
the
least
trace
of
any
old
or
recent
landings
no
debris
no
mark
of
an
encampment
no
cinders
of
a
fire
nor
even
a
footprint
from
the
point
of
the
peninsula
on
which
the
settlers
now
were
their
gaze
could
extend
along
the
southwest
twentyfive
miles
off
the
coast
terminated
in
the
claw
cape
which
loomed
dimly
through
the
morning
mists
and
which
by
the
phenomenon
of
the
mirage
appeared
as
if
suspended
between
land
and
water
between
the
place
occupied
by
the
colonists
and
the
other
side
of
the
immense
bay
the
shore
was
composed
first
of
a
tract
of
low
land
bordered
in
the
background
by
trees
then
the
shore
became
more
irregular
projecting
sharp
points
into
the
sea
and
finally
ended
in
the
black
rocks
which
accumulated
in
picturesque
disorder
formed
claw
cape
such
was
the
development
of
this
part
of
the
island
which
the
settlers
took
in
at
a
glance
while
stopping
for
an
instant
if
a
vessel
ran
in
here
said
pencroft
she
would
certainly
be
lost
sandbanks
and
reefs
everywhere
bad
quarters
but
at
least
something
would
be
left
of
the
ship
observed
the
reporter
there
might
be
pieces
of
wood
on
the
rocks
but
nothing
on
the
sands
replied
the
sailor
why
because
the
sands
are
still
more
dangerous
than
the
rocks
for
they
swallow
up
everything
that
is
thrown
on
them
in
a
few
days
the
hull
of
a
ship
of
several
hundred
tons
would
disappear
entirely
in
there
so
pencroft
asked
the
engineer
if
a
ship
has
been
wrecked
on
these
banks
is
it
not
astonishing
that
there
is
now
no
trace
of
her
remaining
no
captain
with
the
aid
of
time
and
tempest
however
it
would
be
surprising
even
in
this
case
that
some
of
the
masts
or
spars
should
not
have
been
thrown
on
the
beach
out
of
reach
of
the
waves
let
us
go
on
with
our
search
then
returned
cyrus
harding
at
one
oclock
the
colonists
arrived
at
the
other
side
of
washington
bay
they
having
now
gone
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
they
then
halted
for
breakfast
here
began
the
irregular
coast
covered
with
lines
of
rocks
and
sandbanks
the
long
seaswell
could
be
seen
breaking
over
the
rocks
in
the
bay
forming
a
foamy
fringe
from
this
point
to
claw
cape
the
beach
was
very
narrow
between
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
the
reefs
walking
was
now
more
difficult
on
account
of
the
numerous
rocks
which
encumbered
the
beach
the
granite
cliff
also
gradually
increased
in
height
and
only
the
green
tops
of
the
trees
which
crowned
it
could
be
seen
after
half
an
hours
rest
the
settlers
resumed
their
journey
and
not
a
spot
among
the
rocks
was
left
unexamined
pencroft
and
neb
even
rushed
into
the
surf
whenever
any
object
attracted
their
attention
but
they
found
nothing
some
curious
formations
of
the
rocks
having
deceived
them
they
ascertained
however
that
eatable
shellfish
abounded
there
but
these
could
not
be
of
any
great
advantage
to
them
until
some
easy
means
of
communication
had
been
established
between
the
two
banks
of
the
mercy
and
until
the
means
of
transport
had
been
perfected
nothing
therefore
which
threw
any
light
on
the
supposed
wreck
could
be
found
on
this
shore
yet
an
object
of
any
importance
such
as
the
hull
of
a
ship
would
have
been
seen
directly
or
any
of
her
masts
and
spars
would
have
been
washed
on
shore
just
as
the
chest
had
been
which
was
found
twenty
miles
from
here
but
there
was
nothing
towards
three
oclock
harding
and
his
companions
arrived
at
a
snug
little
creek
it
formed
quite
a
natural
harbor
invisible
from
the
sea
and
was
entered
by
a
narrow
channel
at
the
back
of
this
creek
some
violent
convulsion
had
torn
up
the
rocky
border
and
a
cutting
by
a
gentle
slope
gave
access
to
an
upper
plateau
which
might
be
situated
at
least
ten
miles
from
claw
cape
and
consequently
four
miles
in
a
straight
line
from
prospect
heights
gideon
spilett
proposed
to
his
companions
that
they
should
make
a
halt
here
they
agreed
readily
for
their
walk
had
sharpened
their
appetites
and
although
it
was
not
their
usual
dinnerhour
no
one
refused
to
strengthen
himself
with
a
piece
of
venison
this
luncheon
would
sustain
them
until
their
supper
which
they
intended
to
take
at
granite
house
in
a
few
minutes
the
settlers
seated
under
a
clump
of
fine
seapines
were
devouring
the
provisions
which
neb
produced
from
his
bag
this
spot
was
raised
from
fifty
to
sixty
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
the
view
was
very
extensive
but
beyond
the
cape
it
ended
in
union
bay
neither
the
islet
nor
prospect
heights
was
visible
and
could
not
be
from
thence
for
the
rising
ground
and
the
curtain
of
trees
closed
the
northern
horizon
it
is
useless
to
add
that
notwithstanding
the
wide
extent
of
sea
which
the
explorers
could
survey
and
though
the
engineer
swept
the
horizon
with
his
glass
no
vessel
could
be
found
the
shore
was
of
course
examined
with
the
same
care
from
the
edge
of
the
water
to
the
cliff
and
nothing
could
be
discovered
even
with
the
aid
of
the
instrument
well
said
gideon
spilett
it
seems
we
must
make
up
our
minds
to
console
ourselves
with
thinking
that
no
one
will
come
to
dispute
with
us
the
possession
of
lincoln
island
but
the
bullet
cried
herbert
that
was
not
imaginary
i
suppose
hang
it
no
exclaimed
pencroft
thinking
of
his
absent
tooth
then
what
conclusion
may
be
drawn
asked
the
reporter
this
replied
the
engineer
that
three
months
or
more
ago
a
vessel
either
voluntarily
or
not
came
here
what
then
you
admit
cyrus
that
she
was
swallowed
up
without
leaving
any
trace
cried
the
reporter
no
my
dear
spilett
but
you
see
that
if
it
is
certain
that
a
human
being
set
foot
on
the
island
it
appears
no
less
certain
that
he
has
now
left
it
then
if
i
understand
you
right
captain
said
herbert
the
vessel
has
left
again
evidently
and
we
have
lost
an
opportunity
to
get
back
to
our
country
said
neb
i
fear
so
very
well
since
the
opportunity
is
lost
let
us
go
on
it
cant
be
helped
said
pencroft
who
felt
homesickness
for
granite
house
but
just
as
they
were
rising
top
was
heard
loudly
barking
and
the
dog
issued
from
the
wood
holding
in
his
mouth
a
rag
soiled
with
mud
neb
seized
it
it
was
a
piece
of
strong
cloth
top
still
barked
and
by
his
going
and
coming
seemed
to
invite
his
master
to
follow
him
into
the
forest
now
theres
something
to
explain
the
bullet
exclaimed
pencroft
a
castaway
replied
herbert
wounded
perhaps
said
neb
or
dead
added
the
reporter
all
ran
after
the
dog
among
the
tall
pines
on
the
border
of
the
forest
harding
and
his
companions
made
ready
their
firearms
in
case
of
an
emergency
they
advanced
some
way
into
the
wood
but
to
their
great
disappointment
they
as
yet
saw
no
signs
of
any
human
being
having
passed
that
way
shrubs
and
creepers
were
uninjured
and
they
had
even
to
cut
them
away
with
the
axe
as
they
had
done
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
forest
it
was
difficult
to
fancy
that
any
human
creature
had
ever
passed
there
but
yet
top
went
backward
and
forward
not
like
a
dog
who
searches
at
random
but
like
a
dog
being
endowed
with
a
mind
who
is
following
up
an
idea
in
about
seven
or
eight
minutes
top
stopped
in
a
glade
surrounded
with
tall
trees
the
settlers
gazed
around
them
but
saw
nothing
neither
under
the
bushes
nor
among
the
trees
what
is
the
matter
top
said
cyrus
harding
top
barked
louder
bounding
about
at
the
foot
of
a
gigantic
pine
all
at
once
pencroft
shoutedho
splendid
capital
what
is
it
asked
spilett
we
have
been
looking
for
a
wreck
at
sea
or
on
land
well
well
and
here
weve
found
one
in
the
air
and
the
sailor
pointed
to
a
great
white
rag
caught
in
the
top
of
the
pine
a
fallen
scrap
of
which
the
dog
had
brought
to
them
but
that
is
not
a
wreck
cried
gideon
spilett
i
beg
your
pardon
returned
pencroft
why
is
it
it
is
all
that
remains
of
our
airy
boat
of
our
balloon
which
has
been
caught
up
aloft
there
at
the
top
of
that
tree
pencroft
was
not
mistaken
and
he
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
in
a
tremendous
hurrah
adding
there
is
good
cloth
there
is
what
will
furnish
us
with
linen
for
years
there
is
what
will
make
us
handkerchiefs
and
shirts
ha
ha
mr
spilett
what
do
you
say
to
an
island
where
shirts
grow
on
the
trees
it
was
certainly
a
lucky
circumstance
for
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
that
the
balloon
after
having
made
its
last
bound
into
the
air
had
fallen
on
the
island
and
thus
given
them
the
opportunity
of
finding
it
again
whether
they
kept
the
case
under
its
present
form
or
whether
they
wished
to
attempt
another
escape
by
it
or
whether
they
usefully
employed
the
several
hundred
yards
of
cotton
which
was
of
fine
quality
pencrofts
joy
was
therefore
shared
by
all
but
it
was
necessary
to
bring
down
the
remains
of
the
balloon
from
the
tree
to
place
it
in
security
and
this
was
no
slight
task
neb
herbert
and
the
sailor
climbing
to
the
summit
of
the
tree
used
all
their
skill
to
disengage
the
now
reduced
balloon
the
operation
lasted
two
hours
and
then
not
only
the
case
with
its
valve
its
springs
its
brasswork
lay
on
the
ground
but
the
net
that
is
to
say
a
considerable
quantity
of
ropes
and
cordage
and
the
circle
and
the
anchor
the
case
except
for
the
fracture
was
in
good
condition
only
the
lower
portion
being
torn
it
was
a
fortune
which
had
fallen
from
the
sky
all
the
same
captain
said
the
sailor
if
we
ever
decide
to
leave
the
island
it
wont
be
in
a
balloon
will
it
these
airboats
wont
go
where
we
want
them
to
go
and
we
have
had
some
experience
in
that
way
look
here
we
will
build
a
craft
of
some
twenty
tons
and
then
we
can
make
a
mainsail
a
foresail
and
a
jib
out
of
that
cloth
as
to
the
rest
of
it
that
will
help
to
dress
us
we
shall
see
pencroft
replied
cyrus
harding
we
shall
see
in
the
meantime
we
must
put
it
in
a
safe
place
said
neb
they
certainly
could
not
think
of
carrying
this
load
of
cloth
ropes
and
cordage
to
granite
house
for
the
weight
of
it
was
very
considerable
and
while
waiting
for
a
suitable
vehicle
in
which
to
convey
it
it
was
of
importance
that
this
treasure
should
not
be
left
longer
exposed
to
the
mercies
of
the
first
storm
the
settlers
uniting
their
efforts
managed
to
drag
it
as
far
as
the
shore
where
they
discovered
a
large
rocky
cavity
which
owing
to
its
position
could
not
be
visited
either
by
the
wind
or
rain
we
needed
a
locker
and
now
we
have
one
said
pencroft
but
as
we
cannot
lock
it
up
it
will
be
prudent
to
hide
the
opening
i
dont
mean
from
twolegged
thieves
but
from
those
with
four
paws
at
six
oclock
all
was
stowed
away
and
after
having
given
the
creek
the
very
suitable
name
of
port
balloon
the
settlers
pursued
their
way
along
claw
cape
pencroft
and
the
engineer
talked
of
the
different
projects
which
it
was
agreed
to
put
into
execution
with
the
briefest
possible
delay
it
was
necessary
first
of
all
to
throw
a
bridge
over
the
mercy
so
as
to
establish
an
easy
communication
with
the
south
of
the
island
then
the
cart
must
be
taken
to
bring
back
the
balloon
for
the
canoe
alone
could
not
carry
it
then
they
would
build
a
decked
boat
and
pencroft
would
rig
it
as
a
cutter
and
they
would
be
able
to
undertake
voyages
of
circumnavigation
round
the
island
etc
in
the
meanwhile
night
came
on
and
it
was
already
dark
when
the
settlers
reached
flotsam
point
where
they
had
found
the
precious
chest
the
distance
between
flotsam
point
and
granite
house
was
another
four
miles
and
it
was
midnight
when
after
having
followed
the
shore
to
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
the
settlers
arrived
at
the
first
angle
formed
by
the
mercy
there
the
river
was
eighty
feet
in
breadth
which
was
awkward
to
cross
but
as
pencroft
had
taken
upon
himself
to
conquer
this
difficulty
he
was
compelled
to
do
it
the
settlers
certainly
had
reason
to
be
pretty
tired
the
journey
had
been
long
and
the
task
of
getting
down
the
balloon
had
not
rested
either
their
arms
or
legs
they
were
anxious
to
reach
granite
house
to
eat
and
sleep
and
if
the
bridge
had
been
constructed
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
would
have
been
at
home
the
night
was
very
dark
pencroft
prepared
to
keep
his
promise
by
constructing
a
sort
of
raft
on
which
to
make
the
passage
of
the
mercy
he
and
neb
armed
with
axes
chose
two
trees
near
the
water
and
began
to
attack
them
at
the
base
cyrus
harding
and
spilett
seated
on
the
bank
waited
till
their
companions
were
ready
for
their
help
while
herbert
roamed
about
though
without
going
to
any
distance
all
at
once
the
lad
who
had
strolled
by
the
river
came
running
back
and
pointing
up
the
mercy
exclaimed
what
is
floating
there
pencroft
stopped
working
and
seeing
an
indistinct
object
moving
through
the
gloom
a
canoe
cried
he
all
approached
and
saw
to
their
extreme
surprise
a
boat
floating
down
the
current
boat
ahoy
shouted
the
sailor
without
thinking
that
perhaps
it
would
be
best
to
keep
silence
no
reply
the
boat
still
drifted
onward
and
it
was
not
more
than
twelve
feet
off
when
the
sailor
exclaimed
but
it
is
our
own
boat
she
has
broken
her
moorings
and
floated
down
the
current
i
must
say
she
has
arrived
very
opportunely
our
boat
murmured
the
engineer
pencroft
was
right
it
was
indeed
the
canoe
of
which
the
rope
had
undoubtedly
broken
and
which
had
come
alone
from
the
sources
of
the
mercy
it
was
very
important
to
seize
it
before
the
rapid
current
should
have
swept
it
away
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
river
but
neb
and
pencroft
cleverly
managed
this
by
means
of
a
long
pole
the
canoe
touched
the
shore
the
engineer
leaped
in
first
and
found
on
examining
the
rope
that
it
had
been
really
worn
through
by
rubbing
against
the
rocks
well
said
the
reporter
to
him
in
a
low
voice
this
is
a
strange
thing
strange
indeed
returned
cyrus
harding
strange
or
not
it
was
very
fortunate
herbert
the
reporter
neb
and
pencroft
embarked
in
turn
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
rope
having
been
worn
through
but
the
astonishing
part
of
the
affair
was
that
the
boat
should
arrive
just
at
the
moment
when
the
settlers
were
there
to
seize
it
on
its
way
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
or
later
it
would
have
been
lost
in
the
sea
if
they
had
been
living
in
the
time
of
genii
this
incident
would
have
given
them
the
right
to
think
that
the
island
was
haunted
by
some
supernatural
being
who
used
his
power
in
the
service
of
the
castaways
a
few
strokes
of
the
oar
brought
the
settlers
to
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
the
canoe
was
hauled
up
on
the
beach
near
the
chimneys
and
all
proceeded
towards
the
ladder
of
granite
house
but
at
that
moment
top
barked
angrily
and
neb
who
was
looking
for
the
first
steps
uttered
a
cry
there
was
no
longer
a
ladder

cyrus
harding
stood
still
without
saying
a
word
his
companions
searched
in
the
darkness
on
the
wall
in
case
the
wind
should
have
moved
the
ladder
and
on
the
ground
thinking
that
it
might
have
fallen
down
but
the
ladder
had
quite
disappeared
as
to
ascertaining
if
a
squall
had
blown
it
on
the
landingplace
half
way
up
that
was
impossible
in
the
dark
if
it
is
a
joke
cried
pencroft
it
is
a
very
stupid
one
to
come
home
and
find
no
staircase
to
go
up
to
your
room
bythats
nothing
for
weary

to
laugh
at

could
do
nothing
but
cry
out
oh
oh
oh
i
begin
to
think
that
very
curious
things
happen
in
lincoln
island
said
pencroft
curious
replied
gideon
spilett
not
at
all
pencroft
nothing
can
be
more
natural
some
one
has
come
during
our
absence
taken
possession
of
our
dwelling
and
drawn
up
the
ladder
some
one
cried
the
sailor
but
who
who
but
the
hunter
who
fired
the
bullet
replied
the
reporter
well
if
there
is
any
one
up
there
replied
pencroft
who
began
to
lose
patience
i
will
give
them
a
hail
and
they
must
answer
and
in
a
stentorian
voice
the
sailor
gave
a
prolonged
halloo
which
was
echoed
again
and
again
from
the
cliff
and
rocks
the
settlers
listened
and
they
thought
they
heard
a
sort
of
chuckling
laugh
of
which
they
could
not
guess
the
origin
but
no
voice
replied
to
pencroft
who
in
vain
repeated
his
vigorous
shouts
there
was
something
indeed
in
this
to
astonish
the
most
apathetic
of
men
and
the
settlers
were
not
men
of
that
description
in
their
situation
every
incident
had
its
importance
and
certainly
during
the
seven
months
which
they
had
spent
on
the
island
they
had
not
before
met
with
anything
of
so
surprising
a
character
be
that
as
it
may
forgetting
their
fatigue
in
the
singularity
of
the
event
they
remained
below
granite
house
not
knowing
what
to
think
not
knowing
what
to
do
questioning
each

without
any

a
satisfactory
reply
every
one
starting
some
supposition

more
unlikely

the
last
neb
bewailed
himself
much
disappointed
at
not
being
able
to
get
into
his
kitchen
for
the
provisions
which
they
had
had
on
their
expedition
were
exhausted
and
they
had
no
means
of
renewing
them
my
friends
at
last
said
cyrus
harding
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
done
at
present
wait
for
day
and
then
act
according
to
circumstances
but
let
us
go
to
the
chimneys
there
we
shall
be
under
shelter
and
if
we
cannot
eat
we
can
at
least
sleep
but
who
is
it
that
has
played
us
this
cool
trick
again
asked
pencroft
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
retire
from
the
spot
whoever
it
was
the
only
thing
practicable
was
to
do
as
the
engineer
proposed
to
go
to
the
chimneys
and
there
wait
for
day
in
the
meanwhile
top
was
ordered
to
mount
guard
below
the
windows
of
granite
house
and
when
top
received
an
order
he
obeyed
it
without
any
questioning
the
brave
dog
therefore
remained
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
while
his
master
with
his
companions
sought
a
refuge
among
the
rocks
to
say
that
the
settlers
notwithstanding
their
fatigue
slept
well
on
the
sandy
floor
of
the
chimneys
would
not
be
true
it
was
not
only
that
they
were
extremely
anxious
to
find
out
the
cause
of
what
had
happened
whether
it
was
the
result
of
an
accident
which
would
be
discovered
at
the
return
of
day
or
whether
on
the
contrary
it
was
the
work
of
a
human
being
but
they
also
had
very
uncomfortable
beds
that
could
not
be
helped
however
for
in
some
way
or
other
at
that
moment
their
dwelling
was
occupied
and
they
could
not
possibly
enter
it
now
granite
house
was
more
than
their
dwelling
it
was
their
warehouse
there
were
all
the
stores
belonging
to
the
colony
weapons
instruments
tools
ammunition
provisions
etc
to
think
that
all
that
might
be
pillaged
and
that
the
settlers
would
have
all
their
work
to
do
over
again
fresh
weapons
and
tools
to
make
was
a
serious
matter
their
uneasiness
led
one
or
other
of
them
also
to
go
out
every
few
minutes
to
see
if
top
was
keeping
good
watch
cyrus
harding
alone
waited
with
his
habitual
patience
although
his
strong
mind
was
exasperated
at
being
confronted
with
such
an
inexplicable
fact
and
he
was
provoked
at
himself
for
allowing
a
feeling
to
which
he
could
not
give
a
name
to
gain
an
influence
over
him
gideon
spilett
shared
his
feelings
in
this
respect
and
the
two
conversed
together
in
whispers
of
the
inexplicable
circumstance
which
baffled
even
their
intelligence
and
experience
it
is
a
joke
said
pencroft
it
is
a
trick
some
one
has
played
us
well
i
dont
like
such
jokes
and
the
joker
had
better
look
out
for
himself
if
he
falls
into
my
hands
i
can
tell
him
as
soon
as
the
first
gleam
of
light
appeared
in
the
east
the
colonists
suitably
armed
repaired
to
the
beach
under
granite
house
the
rising
sun
now
shone
on
the
cliff
and
they
could
see
the
windows
the
shutters
of
which
were
closed
through
the
curtains
of
foliage
all
here
was
in
order
but
a
cry
escaped
the
colonists
when
they
saw
that
the
door
which
they
had
closed
on
their
departure
was
now
wide
open
some
one
had
entered
granite
housethere
could
be
no
more
doubt
about
that
the
upper
ladder
which
generally
hung
from
the
door
to
the
landing
was
in
its
place
but
the
lower
ladder
was
drawn
up
and
raised
to
the
threshold
it
was
evident
that
the
intruders
had
wished
to
guard
themselves
against
a
surprise
pencroft
hailed
again
no
reply
the
beggars
exclaimed
the
sailor
there
they
are
sleeping
quietly
as
if
they
were
in
their
own
house
hallo
there
you
pirates
brigands
robbers
sons
of
john
bull
when
pencroft
being
a
yankee
treated
any
one
to
the
epithet
of
son
of
john
bull
he
considered
he
had
reached
the
last
limits
of
insult
the
sun
had
now
completely
risen
and
the
whole
facade
of
granite
house
became
illuminated
by
its
rays
but
in
the
interior
as
well
as
on
the
exterior
all
was
quiet
and
calm
the
settlers
asked
if
granite
house
was
inhabited
or
not
and
yet
the
position
of
the
ladder
was
sufficient
to
show
that
it
was
it
was
also
certain
that
the
inhabitants
whoever
they
might
be
had
not
been
able
to
escape
but
how
were
they
to
be
got
at
herbert
then
thought
of
fastening
a
cord
to
an
arrow
and
shooting
the
arrow
so
that
it
should
pass
between
the
first
rounds
of
the
ladder
which
hung
from
the
threshold
by
means
of
the
cord
they
would
then
be
able
to
draw
down
the
ladder
to
the
ground
and
so
reestablish
the
communication
between
the
beach
and
granite
house
there
was
evidently
nothing
else
to
be
done
and
with
a
little
skill
this
method
might
succeed
very
fortunately
bows
and
arrows
had
been
left
at
the
chimneys
where
they
also
found
a
quantity
of
light
hibiscus
cord
pencroft
fastened
this
to
a
wellfeathered
arrow
then
herbert
fixing
it
to
his
bow
took
a
careful
aim
for
the
lower
part
of
the
ladder
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
pencroft
and
neb
drew
back
so
as
to
see
if
anything
appeared
at
the
windows
the
reporter
lifted
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
covered
the
door
the
bow
was
bent
the
arrow
flew
taking
the
cord
with
it
and
passed
between
the
two
last
rounds
the
operation
had
succeeded
herbert
immediately
seized
the
end
of
the
cord
but
at
that
moment
when
he
gave
it
a
pull
to
bring
down
the
ladder
an
arm
thrust
suddenly
out
between
the
wall
and
the
door
grasped
it
and
dragged
it
inside
granite
house
the
rascals
shouted
the
sailor
if
a
ball
can
do
anything
for
you
you
shall
not
have
long
to
wait
for
it
but
who
was
it
asked
neb
who
was
it
didnt
you
see
no
it
was
a
monkey
a
sapajou
an
orangoutang
a
baboon
a
gorilla
a
sagoin
our
dwelling
has
been
invaded
by
monkeys
who
climbed
up
the
ladder
during
our
absence
and
at
this
moment
as
if
to
bear
witness
to
the
truth
of
the
sailors
words
two
or
three
quadrumana
showed
themselves
at
the
windows
from
which
they
had
pushed
back
the
shutters
and
saluted
the
real
proprietors
of
the
place
with
a
thousand
hideous
grimaces
i
knew
that
it
was
only
a
joke
cried
pencroft
but
one
of
the
jokers
shall
pay
the
penalty
for
the
rest
so
saying
the
sailor
raising
his
piece
took
a
rapid
aim
at
one
of
the
monkeys
and
fired
all
disappeared
except
one
who
fell
mortally
wounded
on
the
beach
this
monkey
which
was
of
a
large
size
evidently
belonged
to
the
first
order
of
the
quadrumana
whether
this
was
a
chimpanzee
an
orangoutang
or
a
gorilla
he
took
rank
among
the
anthropoid
apes
who
are
so
called
from
their
resemblance
to
the
human
race
however
herbert
declared
it
to
be
an
orangoutang
what
a
magnificent
beast
cried
neb
magnificent
if
you
like
replied
pencroft
but
still
i
do
not
see
how
we
are
to
get
into
our
house
herbert
is
a
good
marksman
said
the
reporter
and
his
bow
is
here
he
can
try
again
why
these
apes
are
so
cunning
returned
pencroft
they
wont
show
themselves
again
at
the
windows
and
so
we
cant
kill
them
and
when
i
think
of
the
mischief
they
may
do
in
the
rooms
and
storehouse
have
patience
replied
harding
these
creatures
cannot
keep
us
long
at
bay
i
shall
not
be
sure
of
that
till
i
see
them
down
here
replied
the
sailor
and
now
captain
do
you
know
how
many
dozens
of
these
fellows
are
up
there
it
was
difficult
to
reply
to
pencroft
and
as
for
the
young
boy
making
another
attempt
that
was
not
easy
for
the
lower
part
of
the
ladder
had
been
drawn
again
into
the
door
and
when
another
pull
was
given
the
line
broke
and
the
ladder
remained
firm
the
case
was
really
perplexing
pencroft
stormed
there
was
a
comic
side
to
the
situation
but
he
did
not
think
it
funny
at
all
it
was
certain
that
the
settlers
would
end
by
reinstating
themselves
in
their
domicile
and
driving
out
the
intruders
but
when
and
how
this
is
what
they
were
not
able
to
say
two
hours
passed
during
which
the
apes
took
care
not
to
show
themselves
but
they
were
still
there
and
three
or
four
times
a
nose
or
a
paw
was
poked
out
at
the
door
or
windows
and
was
immediately
saluted
by
a
gunshot
let
us
hide
ourselves
at
last
said
the
engineer
perhaps
the
apes
will
think
we
have
gone
quite
away
and
will
show
themselves
again
let
spilett
and
herbert
conceal
themselves
behind
those
rocks
and
fire
on
all
that
may
appear
the
engineers
orders
were
obeyed
and
while
the
reporter
and
the
lad
the
best
marksmen
in
the
colony
posted
themselves
in
a
good
position
but
out
of
the
monkeys
sight
neb
pencroft
and
cyrus
climbed
the
plateau
and
entered
the
forest
in
order
to
kill
some
game
for
it
was
now
time
for
breakfast
and
they
had
no
provisions
remaining
in
half
an
hour
the
hunters
returned
with
a
few
rock
pigeons
which
they
roasted
as
well
as
they
could
not
an
ape
had
appeared
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
went
to
take
their
share
of
the
breakfast
leaving
top
to
watch
under
the
windows
they
then
having
eaten
returned
to
their
post
two
hours
later
their
situation
was
in
no
degree
improved
the
quadrumana
gave
no
sign
of
existence
and
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
they
had
disappeared
but
what
seemed
more
probable
was
that
terrified
by
the
death
of
one
of
their
companions
and
frightened
by
the
noise
of
the
firearms
they
had
retreated
to
the
back
part
of
the
house
or
probably
even
into
the
storeroom
and
when
they
thought
of
the
valuables
which
this
storeroom
contained
the
patience
so
much
recommended
by
the
engineer
fast
changed
into
great
irritation
and
there
certainly
was
room
for
it
decidedly
it
is
too
bad
said
the
reporter
and
the
worst
of
it
is
there
is
no
way
of
putting
an
end
to
it
but
we
must
drive
these
vagabonds
out
somehow
cried
the
sailor
we
could
soon
get
the
better
of
them
even
if
there
are
twenty
of
the
rascals
but
for
that
we
must
meet
them
hand
to
hand
come
now
is
there
no
way
of
getting
at
them
let
us
try
to
enter
granite
house
by
the
old
opening
at
the
lake
replied
the
engineer
oh
shouted
the
sailor
and
i
never
thought
of
that
this
was
in
reality
the
only
way
by
which
to
penetrate
into
granite
house
so
as
to
fight
with
and
drive
out
the
intruders
the
opening
was
it
is
true
closed
up
with
a
wall
of
cemented
stones
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
sacrifice
but
that
could
easily
be
rebuilt
fortunately
cyrus
harding
had
not
as
yet
effected
his
project
of
hiding
this
opening
by
raising
the
waters
of
the
lake
for
the
operation
would
then
have
taken
some
time
it
was
already
past
twelve
oclock
when
the
colonists
well
armed
and
provided
with
picks
and
spades
left
the
chimneys
passed
beneath
the
windows
of
granite
house
after
telling
top
to
remain
at
his
post
and
began
to
ascend
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
so
as
to
reach
prospect
heights
but
they
had
not
made
fifty
steps
in
this
direction
when
they
heard
the
dog
barking
furiously
and
all
rushed
down
the
bank
again
arrived
at
the
turning
they
saw
that
the
situation
had
changed
in
fact
the
apes
seized
with
a
sudden
panic
from
some
unknown
cause
were
trying
to
escape
two
or
three
ran
and
clambered
from
one
window
to
another
with
the
agility
of
acrobats
they
were
not
even
trying
to
replace
the
ladder
by
which
it
would
have
been
easy
to
descend
perhaps
in
their
terror
they
had
forgotten
this
way
of
escape
the
colonists
now
being
able
to
take
aim
without
difficulty
fired
some
wounded
or
killed
fell
back
into
the
rooms
uttering
piercing
cries
the
rest
throwing
themselves
out
were
dashed
to
pieces
in
their
fall
and
in
a
few
minutes
so
far
as
they
knew
there
was
not
a
living
quadrumana
in
granite
house
at
this
moment
the
ladder
was
seen
to
slip
over
the
threshold
then
unroll
and
fall
to
the
ground
hullo
cried
the
sailor
this
is
queer
very
strange
murmured
the
engineer
leaping
first
up
the
ladder
take
care
captain
cried
pencroft
perhaps
there
are
still
some
of
these
rascals
we
shall
soon
see
replied
the
engineer
without
stopping
however
all
his
companions
followed
him
and
in
a
minute
they
had
arrived
at
the
threshold
they
searched
everywhere
there
was
no
one
in
the
rooms
nor
in
the
storehouse
which
had
been
respected
by
the
band
of
quadrumana
well
now
and
the
ladder
cried
the
sailor
who
can
the
gentleman
have
been
who
sent
us
that
down
but
at
that
moment
a
cry
was
heard
and
a
great
orang
who
had
hidden
himself
in
the
passage
rushed
into
the
room
pursued
by
neb
ah
the
robber
cried
pencroft
and
hatchet
in
hand
he
was
about
to
cleave
the
head
of
the
animal
when
cyrus
harding
seized
his
arm
saying
spare
him
pencroft
pardon
this
rascal
yes
it
was
he
who
threw
us
the
ladder
and
the
engineer
said
this
in
such
a
peculiar
voice
that
it
was
difficult
to
know
whether
he
spoke
seriously
or
not
nevertheless
they
threw
themselves
on
the
orang
who
defended
himself
gallantly
but
was
soon
overpowered
and
bound
there
said
pencroft
and
what
shall
we
make
of
him
now
weve
got
him
a
servant
replied
herbert
the
lad
was
not
joking
in
saying
this
for
he
knew
how
this
intelligent
race
could
be
turned
to
account
the
settlers
then
approached
the
ape
and
gazed
at
it
attentively
he
belonged
to
the
family
of
anthropoid
apes
of
which
the
facial
angle
is
not
much
inferior
to
that
of
the
australians
and
hottentots
it
was
an
orangoutang
and
as
such
had
neither
the
ferocity
of
the
gorilla
nor
the
stupidity
of
the
baboon
it
is
to
this
family
of
the
anthropoid
apes
that
so
many
characteristics
belong
which
prove
them
to
be
possessed
of
an
almost
human
intelligence
employed
in
houses
they
can
wait
at
table
sweep
rooms
brush
clothes
clean
boots
handle
a
knife
fork
and
spoon
properly
and
even
drink
wine
doing
everything
as
well
as
the
best
servant
that
ever
walked
upon
two
legs
buffon
possessed
one
of
these
apes
who
served
him
for
a
long
time
as
a
faithful
and
zealous
servant
the
one
which
had
been
seized
in
the
hall
of
granite
house
was
a
great
fellow
six
feet
high
with
an
admirably
poportioned
frame
a
broad
chest
head
of
a
moderate
size
the
facial
angle
reaching
sixtyfive
degrees
round
skull
projecting
nose
skin
covered
with
soft
glossy
hair
in
short
a
fine
specimen
of
the
anthropoids
his
eyes
rather
smaller
than
human
eyes
sparkled
with
intelligence
his
white
teeth
glittered
under
his
mustache
and
he
wore
a
little
curly
brown
beard
a
handsome
fellow
said
pencroft
if
we
only
knew
his
language
we
could
talk
to
him
but
master
said
neb
are
you
serious
are
we
going
to
take
him
as
a
servant
yes
neb
replied
the
engineer
smiling
but
you
must
not
be
jealous
and
i
hope
he
will
make
an
excellent
servant
added
herbert
he
appears
young
and
will
be
easy
to
educate
and
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
use
force
to
subdue
him
nor
draw
his
teeth
as
is
sometimes
done
he
will
soon
grow
fond
of
his
masters
if
they
are
kind
to
him
and
they
will
be
replied
pencroft
who
had
forgotten
all
his
rancor
against
the
jokers
then
approaching
the
orang
well
old
boy
he
asked
how
are
you
the
orang
replied
by
a
little
grunt
which
did
not
show
any
anger
you
wish
to
join
the
colony
again
asked
the
sailor
you
are
going
to
enter
the
service
of
captain
cyrus
harding
another
respondent
grunt
was
uttered
by
the
ape
and
you
will
be
satisfied
with
no
other
wages
than
your
food
third
affirmative
grunt
this
conversation
is
slightly
monotonous
observed
gideon
spilett
so
much
the
better
replied
pencroft
the
best
servants
are
those
who
talk
the
least
and
then
no
wages
do
you
hear
my
boy
we
will
give
you
no
wages
at
first
but
we
will
double
them
afterwards
if
we
are
pleased
with
you
thus
the
colony
was
increased
by
a
new
member
as
to
his
name
the
sailor
begged
that
in
memory
of
another
ape
which
he
had
known
he
might
be
called
jupiter
and
jup
for
short
and
so
without
more
ceremony
master
jup
was
installed
in
granite
house
chapter
7
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
had
now
regained
their
dwelling
without
having
been
obliged
to
reach
it
by
the
old
opening
and
were
therefore
spared
the
trouble
of
masons
work
it
was
certainly
lucky
that
at
the
moment
they
were
about
to
set
out
to
do
so
the
apes
had
been
seized
with
that
terror
no
less
sudden
than
inexplicable
which
had
driven
them
out
of
granite
house
had
the
animals
discovered
that
they
were
about
to
be
attacked
from
another
direction
this
was
the
only
explanation
of
their
sudden
retreat
during
the
day
the
bodies
of
the
apes
were
carried
into
the
wood
where
they
were
buried
then
the
settlers
busied
themselves
in
repairing
the
disorder
caused
by
the
intruders
disorder
but
not
damage
for
although
they
had
turned
everything
in
the
rooms
topsyturvy
yet
they
had
broken
nothing
neb
relighted
his
stove
and
the
stores
in
the
larder
furnished
a
substantial
repast
to
which
all
did
ample
justice
jup
was
not
forgotten
and
he
ate
with
relish
some
stonepine
almonds
and
rhizome
roots
with
which
he
was
abundantly
supplied
pencroft
had
unfastened
his
arms
but
judged
it
best
to
have
his
legs
tied
until
they
were
more
sure
of
his
submission
then
before
retiring
to
rest
harding
and
his
companions
seated
round
their
table
discussed
those
plans
the
execution
of
which
was
most
pressing
the
most
important
and
most
urgent
was
the
establishment
of
a
bridge
over
the
mercy
so
as
to
form
a
communication
with
the
southern
part
of
the
island
and
granite
house
then
the
making
of
an
enclosure
for
the
musmons
or
other
woolly
animals
which
they
wished
to
capture
these
two
projects
would
help
to
solve
the
difficulty
as
to
their
clothing
which
was
now
serious
the
bridge
would
render
easy
the
transport
of
the
balloon
case
which
would
furnish
them
with
linen
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
enclosure
would
yield
wool
which
would
supply
them
with
winter
clothes
as
to
the
enclosure
it
was
cyrus
hardings
intention
to
establish
it
at
the
sources
of
the
red
creek
where
the
ruminants
would
find
fresh
and
abundant
pasture
the
road
between
prospect
heights
and
the
sources
of
the
stream
was
already
partly
beaten
and
with
a
better
cart
than
the
first
the
material
could
be
easily
conveyed
to
the
spot
especially
if
they
could
manage
to
capture
some
animals
to
draw
it
but
though
there
might
be
no
inconvenience
in
the
enclosure
being
so
far
from
granite
house
it
would
not
be
the
same
with
the
poultryyard
to
which
neb
called
the
attention
of
the
colonists
it
was
indeed
necessary
that
the
birds
should
be
close
within
reach
of
the
cook
and
no
place
appeared
more
favorable
for
the
establishment
of
the
said
poultryyard
than
that
portion
of
the
banks
of
the
lake
which
was
close
to
the
old
opening
waterbirds
would
prosper
there
as
well
as
others
and
the
couple
of
tinamous
taken
in
their
last
excursion
would
be
the
first
to
be
domesticated
the
next
day
the
3rd
of
november
the
new
works
were
begun
by
the
construction
of
the
bridge
and
all
hands
were
required
for
this
important
task
saws
hatchets
and
hammers
were
shouldered
by
the
settlers
who
now
transformed
into
carpenters
descended
to
the
shore
there
pencroft
observed
suppose
that
during
our
absence
master
jup
takes
it
into
his
head
to
draw
up
the
ladder
which
he
so
politely
returned
to
us
yesterday
let
us
tie
its
lower
end
down
firmly
replied
cyrus
harding
this
was
done
by
means
of
two
stakes
securely
fixed
in
the
sand
then
the
settlers
ascending
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
soon
arrived
at
the
angle
formed
by
the
river
there
they
halted
in
order
to
ascertain
if
the
bridge
could
be
thrown
across
the
place
appeared
suitable
in
fact
from
this
spot
to
port
balloon
discovered
the
day
before
on
the
southern
coast
there
was
only
a
distance
of
three
miles
and
a
half
and
from
the
bridge
to
the
port
it
would
be
easy
to
make
a
good
cartroad
which
would
render
the
communication
between
granite
house
and
the
south
of
the
island
extremely
easy
cyrus
harding
now
imparted
to
his
companions
a
scheme
for
completely
isolating
prospect
heights
so
as
to
shelter
it
from
the
attacks
both
of
quadrupeds
and
quadrumana
in
this
way
granite
house
the
chimneys
the
poultryyard
and
all
the
upper
part
of
the
plateau
which
was
to
be
used
for
cultivation
would
be
protected
against
the
depredations
of
animals
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
execute
this
project
and
this
is
how
the
engineer
intended
to
set
to
work
the
plateau
was
already
defended
on
three
sides
by
watercourses
either
artificial
or
natural
on
the
northwest
by
the
shores
of
lake
grant
from
the
entrance
of
the
passage
to
the
breach
made
in
the
banks
of
the
lake
for
the
escape
of
the
water
on
the
north
from
this
breach
to
the
sea
by
the
new
watercourse
which
had
hollowed
out
a
bed
for
itself
across
the
plateau
and
shore
above
and
below
the
fall
and
it
would
be
enough
to
dig
the
bed
of
this
creek
a
little
deeper
to
make
it
impracticable
for
animals
on
all
the
eastern
border
by
the
sea
itself
from
the
mouth
of
the
aforesaid
creek
to
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
lastly
on
the
south
from
the
mouth
to
the
turn
of
the
mercy
where
the
bridge
was
to
be
established
the
western
border
of
the
plateau
now
remained
between
the
turn
of
the
river
and
the
southern
angle
of
the
lake
a
distance
of
about
a
mile
which
was
open
to
all
comers
but
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
dig
a
broad
deep
ditch
which
could
be
filled
from
the
lake
and
the
overflow
of
which
would
throw
itself
by
a
rapid
fall
into
the
bed
of
the
mercy
the
level
of
the
lake
would
no
doubt
be
somewhat
lowered
by
this
fresh
discharge
of
its
waters
but
cyrus
harding
had
ascertained
that
the
volume
of
water
in
the
red
creek
was
considerable
enough
to
allow
of
the
execution
of
this
project
so
then
added
the
engineer
prospect
heights
will
become
a
regular
island
being
surrounded
with
water
on
all
sides
and
only
communicating
with
the
rest
of
our
domain
by
the
bridge
which
we
are
about
to
throw
across
the
mercy
the
two
little
bridges
already
established
above
and
below
the
fall
and
lastly
two
other
little
bridges
which
must
be
constructed
one
over
the
canal
which
i
propose
to
dig
the
other
across
to
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
now
if
these
bridges
can
be
raised
at
will
prospect
heights
will
be
guarded
from
any
surprise
the
bridge
was
the
most
urgent
work
trees
were
selected
cut
down
stripped
of
their
branches
and
cut
into
beams
joists
and
planks
the
end
of
the
bridge
which
rested
on
the
right
bank
of
the
mercy
was
to
be
firm
but
the
other
end
on
the
left
bank
was
to
be
movable
so
that
it
might
be
raised
by
means
of
a
counterpoise
as
some
canal
bridges
are
managed
this
was
certainly
a
considerable
work
and
though
it
was
skillfully
conducted
it
took
some
time
for
the
mercy
at
this
place
was
eighty
feet
wide
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
fix
piles
in
the
bed
of
the
river
so
as
to
sustain
the
floor
of
the
bridge
and
establish
a
piledriver
to
act
on
the
tops
of
these
piles
which
would
thus
form
two
arches
and
allow
the
bridge
to
support
heavy
loads
happily
there
was
no
want
of
tools
with
which
to
shape
the
wood
nor
of
ironwork
to
make
it
firm
nor
of
the
ingenuity
of
a
man
who
had
a
marvelous
knowledge
of
the
work
nor
lastly
the
zeal
of
his
companions
who
in
seven
months
had
necessarily
acquired
great
skill
in
the
use
of
their
tools
and
it
must
be
said
that
not
the
least
skilful
was
gideon
spilett
who
in
dexterity
almost
equaled
the
sailor
himself
who
would
ever
have
expected
so
much
from
a
newspaper
man
thought
pencroft
the
construction
of
the
mercy
bridge
lasted
three
weeks
of
regular
hard
work
they
even
breakfasted
on
the
scene
of
their
labors
and
the
weather
being
magnificent
they
only
returned
to
granite
house
to
sleep
during
this
period
it
may
be
stated
that
master
jup
grew
more
accustomed
to
his
new
masters
whose
movements
he
always
watched
with
very
inquisitive
eyes
however
as
a
precautionary
measure
pencroft
did
not
as
yet
allow
him
complete
liberty
rightly
wishing
to
wait
until
the
limits
of
the
plateau
should
be
settled
by
the
projected
works
top
and
jup
were
good
friends
and
played
willingly
together
but
jup
did
everything
solemnly
on
the
20th
of
november
the
bridge
was
finished
the
movable
part
balanced
by
the
counterpoise
swung
easily
and
only
a
slight
effort
was
needed
to
raise
it
between
its
hinge
and
the
last
crossbar
on
which
it
rested
when
closed
there
existed
a
space
of
twenty
feet
which
was
sufficiently
wide
to
prevent
any
animals
from
crossing
the
settlers
now
began
to
talk
of
fetching
the
ballooncase
which
they
were
anxious
to
place
in
perfect
security
but
to
bring
it
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
a
cart
to
port
balloon
and
consequently
necessary
to
beat
a
road
through
the
dense
forests
of
the
far
west
this
would
take
some
time
also
neb
and
pencroft
having
gone
to
examine
into
the
state
of
things
at
port
balloon
and
reported
that
the
stock
of
cloth
would
suffer
no
damage
in
the
grotto
where
it
was
stored
it
was
decided
that
the
work
at
prospect
heights
should
not
be
discontinued
that
observed
pencroft
will
enable
us
to
establish
our
poultryyard
under
better
conditions
since
we
need
have
no
fear
of
visits
from
foxes
nor
the
attacks
of
other
beasts
then
added
neb
we
can
clear
the
plateau
and
transplant
wild
plants
to
it
and
prepare
our
second
cornfield
cried
the
sailor
with
a
triumphant
air
in
fact
the
first
cornfield
sown
with
a
single
grain
had
prospered
admirably
thanks
to
pencrofts
care
it
had
produced
the
ten
ears
foretold
by
the
engineer
and
each
ear
containing
eighty
grains
the
colony
found
itself
in
possession
of
eight
hundred
grains
in
six
months
which
promised
a
double
harvest
each
year
these
eight
hundred
grains
except
fifty
which
were
prudently
reserved
were
to
be
sown
in
a
new
field
but
with
no
less
care
than
was
bestowed
on
the

prepared
then
surrounded
with
a
strong
palisade
high
and
pointed
which
quadrupeds
would
have
found
difficulty
in
leaping

some
scarecrows

enough
to
frighten
them
the
seven
hundred

fifty

deposited
in
very
regular
furrows
were
then
left
for

to
do
the
rest
on
the
21st
of
november
cyrus
harding
began
to
plan
the
canal
which
was
to
close
the
plateau
on
the
west
from
the
south
angle
of
lake
grant
to
the
angle
of
the
mercy
there
was
there
two
or
three
feet
of
vegetable
earth
and
below
that
granite
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
manufacture
some
more
nitroglycerine
and
the
nitroglycerine
did
its
accustomed
work
in
less
than
a
fortnight
a
ditch
twelve
feet
wide
and
six
deep
was
dug
out
in
the
hard
ground
of
the
plateau
a
new
trench
was
made
by
the
same
means
in
the
rocky
border
of
the
lake
forming
a
small
stream
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
creek
glycerine
and
which
was
thus
an
affluent
of
the
mercy
as
the
engineer
had
predicted
the
level
of
the
lake
was
lowered
though
very
slightly
to
complete
the
enclosure
the
bed
of
the
stream
on
the
beach
was
considerably
enlarged
and
the
sand
supported
by
means
of
stakes
by
the
end
of
the
first
fortnight
of
december
these
works
were
finished
and
prospect
heightsthat
is
to
say
a
sort
of
irregular
pentagon
having
a
perimeter
of
nearly
four
miles
surrounded
by
a
liquid
beltwas
completely
protected
from
depredators
of
every
description
during
the
month
of
december
the
heat
was
very
great
in
spite
of
it
however
the
settlers
continued
their
work
and
as
they
were
anxious
to
possess
a
poultryyard
they
forthwith
commenced
it
it
is
useless
to
say
that
since
the
enclosing
of
the
plateau
had
been
completed
master
jup
had
been
set
at
liberty
he
did
not
leave
his
masters
and
evinced
no
wish
to
escape
he
was
a
gentle
animal
though
very
powerful
and
wonderfully
active
he
was
already
taught
to
make
himself
useful
by
drawing
loads
of
wood
and
carting
away
the
stones
which
were
extracted
from
the
bed
of
creek
glycerine
the
poultryyard
occupied
an
area
of
two
hundred
square
yards
on
the
southeastern
bank
of
the
lake
it
was
surrounded
by
a
palisade
and
in
it
were
constructed
various
shelters
for
the
birds
which
were
to
populate
it
these
were
simply
built
of
branches
and
divided
into
compartments
made
ready
for
the
expected
guests
the
first
were
the
two
tinamous
which
were
not
long
in
having
a
number
of
young
ones
they
had
for
companions
half
a
dozen
ducks
accustomed
to
the
borders
of
the
lake
some
belonged
to
the
chinese
species
of
which
the
wings
open
like
a
fan
and
which
by
the
brilliancy
of
their
plumage
rival
the
golden
pheasants
a
few
days
afterwards
herbert
snared
a
couple
of
gallinaceae
with
spreading
tails
composed
of
long
feathers
magnificent
alectors
which
soon
became
tame
as
to
pelicans
kingfishers
waterhens
they
came
of
themselves
to
the
shores
of
the
poultryyard
and
this
little
community
after
some
disputes
cooing
screaming
clucking
ended
by
settling
down
peacefully
and
increased
in
encouraging
proportion
for
the
future
use
of
the
colony
cyrus
harding
wishing
to
complete
his
performance
established
a
pigeonhouse
in
a
corner
of
the
poultryyard
there
he
lodged
a
dozen
of
those
pigeons
which
frequented
the
rocks
of
the
plateau
these
birds
soon
became
accustomed
to
returning
every
evening
to
their
new
dwelling
and
showed
more
disposition
to
domesticate
themselves
than
their
congeners
the
woodpigeons
lastly
the
time
had
come
for
turning
the
ballooncase
to
use
by
cutting
it
up
to
make
shirts
and
other
articles
for
as
to
keeping
it
in
its
present
form
and
risking
themselves
in
a
balloon
filled
with
gas
above
a
sea
of
the
limits
of
which
they
had
no
idea
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
it
was
necessary
to
bring
the
case
to
granite
house
and
the
colonists
employed
themselves
in
rendering
their
heavy
cart
lighter
and
more
manageable
but
though
they
had
a
vehicle
the
moving
power
was
yet
to
be
found
but
did
there
not
exist
in
the
island
some
animal
which
might
supply
the
place
of
the
horse
ass
or
ox
that
was
the
question
certainly
said
pencroft
a
beast
of
burden
would
be
very
useful
to
us
until
the
captain
has
made
a
steam
cart
or
even
an
engine
for
some
day
we
shall
have
a
railroad
from
granite
house
to
port

with
a
branch
line
to
mount

one
day
the
23rd
of
december
neb
and
top
were
heard
shouting
and
barking
each
apparently
trying
to
see
who
could
make
the
most
noise
the
settlers
who
were
busy
at
the
chimneys
ran
fearing
some
vexatious
incident
what
did
they
see
two
fine
animals
of
a
large
size
that
had
imprudently
ventured
on
the
plateau
when
the
bridges
were
open
one
would
have
said
they
were
horses
or
at
least
donkeys
male
and
female
of
a
fine
shape
dovecolored
the
legs
and
tail
white
striped
with
black
on
the
head
and
neck
they
advanced
quietly
without
showing
any
uneasiness
and
gazed
at
the
men
in
whom
they
could
not
as
yet
recognize
their
future
masters
these
are
onagers
cried
herbert
animals
something
between
the
zebra
and
the
quagga
why
not
donkeys
asked
neb
because
they
have
not
long
ears
and
their
shape
is
more
graceful

or
horses
interrupted
pencroft
they
are
moving
powers
as
the
captain
would
say
and
as
such
must
be
captured
the
sailor
without
frightening
the
animals
crept
through
the
grass
to
the
bridge
over
creek
glycerine
lowered
it
and
the
onagers
were
prisoners
now
should
they
seize
them
with
violence
and
master
them
by
force
no
it
was
decided
that
for
a
few
days
they
should
be
allowed
to
roam
freely
about
the
plateau
where
there
was
an
abundance
of
grass
and
the
engineer
immediately
began
to
prepare
a
stable
near
the
poultryyard
in
which
the
onagers
might
find
food
with
a
good
litter
and
shelter
during
the
night
this
done
the
movements
of
the
two
magnificent
creatures
were
left
entirely
free
and
the
settlers
avoided
even
approaching
them
so
as
to
terrify
them
several
times
however
the
onagers
appeared
to
wish
to
leave
the
plateau
too
confined
for
animals
accustomed
to
the
plains
and
forests
they
were
then
seen
following
the
waterbarrier
which
everywhere
presented
itself
before
them
uttering
short
neighs
then
galloping
through
the
grass
and
becoming
calmer
they
would
remain
entire
hours
gazing
at
the
woods
from
which
they
were
cut
off
for
ever
in
the
meantime
harness
of
vegetable
fiber
had
been
manufactured
and
some
days
after
the
capture
of
the
onagers
not
only
the
cart
was
ready
but
a
straight
road
or
rather
a
cutting
had
been
made
through
the
forests
of
the
far
west
from
the
angle
of
the
mercy
to
port
balloon
the
cart
might
then
be
driven
there
and
towards
the
end
of
december
they
tried
the
onagers
for
the
first
time
pencroft
had
already
coaxed
the
animals
to
come
and
eat
out
of
his
hand
and
they
allowed
him
to
approach
without
making
any
difficulty
but
once
harnessed
they
reared
and
could
with
difficulty
be
held
in
however
it
was
not
long
before
they
submitted
to
this
new
service
for
the
onager
being
less
refractory
than
the
zebra
is
frequently
put
in
harness
in
the
mountainous
regions
of
southern
africa
and
it
has
even
been
acclimatized
in
europe
under
zones
of
a
relative
coolness
on
this
day
all
the
colony
except
pencroft
who
walked
at
the
animals
heads
mounted
the
cart
and
set
out
on
the
road
to
port
balloon
of
course
they
were
jolted
over
the
somewhat
rough
road
but
the
vehicle
arrived
without
any
accident
and
was
soon
loaded
with
the
case
and
rigging
of
the
balloon
at
eight
oclock
that
evening
the
cart
after
passing
over
the
mercy
bridge
descended
the
left
bank
of
the
river
and
stopped
on
the
beach
the
onagers
being
unharnessed
were
thence
led
to
their
stable
and
pencroft
before
going
to
sleep
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
in
a
deep
sigh
of
satisfaction
that
awoke
all
the
echoes
of
granite
house
chapter
8
the
first
week
of
january
was
devoted
to
the
manufacture
of
the
linen
garments
required
by
the
colony
the
needles
found
in
the
box
were
used
by
sturdy
if
not
delicate
fingers
and
we
may
be
sure
that
what
was
sewn
was
sewn
firmly
there
was
no
lack
of
thread
thanks
to
cyrus
hardings
idea
of
reemploying
that
which
had
been
already
used
in
the
covering
of
the
balloon
this
with
admirable
patience
was
all
unpicked
by
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
for
pencroft
had
been
obliged
to
give
this
work
up
as
it
irritated
him
beyond
measure
but
he
had
no
equal
in
the
sewing
part
of
the
business
indeed
everybody
knows
that
sailors
have
a
remarkable
aptitude
for
tailoring
the
cloth
of
which
the
ballooncase
was
made
was
then
cleaned
by
means
of
soda
and
potash
obtained
by
the
incineration
of
plants
in
such
a
way
that
the
cotton
having
got
rid
of
the
varnish
resumed
its
natural
softness
and
elasticity
then
exposed
to
the
action
of
the
atmosphere
it
soon
became
perfectly
white
some
dozen
shirts
and
sockthe
latter
not
knitted
of
course
but
made
of
cottonwere
thus
manufactured
what
a
comfort
it
was
to
the
settlers
to
clothe
themselves
again
in
clean
linen
which
was
doubtless
rather
rough
but
they
were
not
troubled
about
that
and
then
to
go
to
sleep
between
sheets
which
made
the
couches
at
granite
house
into
quite
comfortable
beds
it
was
about
this
time
also
that
they
made
boots
of
sealleather
which
were
greatly
needed
to
replace
the
shoes
and
boots
brought
from
america
we
may
be
sure
that
these
new
shoes
were
large
enough
and
never
pinched
the
feet
of
the
wearers
with
the
beginning
of
the
year
1866
the
heat
was
very
great
but
the
hunting
in
the
forests
did
not
stand
still
agouties
peccaries
capybaras
kangaroos
game
of
all
sorts
actually
swarmed
there
and
spilett
and
herbert
were
too
good
marksmen
ever
to
throw
away
their
shot
uselessly
cyrus
harding
still
recommended
them
to
husband
the
ammunition
and
he
took
measures
to
replace
the
powder
and
shot
which
had
been
found
in
the
box
and
which
he
wished
to
reserve
for
the
future
how
did
he
know
where
chance
might
one
day
cast
his
companions
and
himself
in
the
event
of
their
leaving
their
domain
they
should
then
prepare
for
the
unknown
future
by
husbanding
their
ammunition
and
by
substituting
for
it
some
easily
renewable
substance
to
replace
lead
of
which
harding
had
found
no
traces
in
the
island
he
employed
granulated
iron
which
was
easy
to
manufacture
these
bullets
not
having
the
weight
of
leaden
bullets
were
made
larger
and
each
charge
contained
less
but
the
skill
of
the
sportsmen
made
up
this
deficiency
as
to
powder
cyrus
harding
would
have
been
able
to
make
that
also
for
he
had
at
his
disposal
saltpeter
sulphur
and
coal
but
this
preparation
requires
extreme
care
and
without
special
tools
it
is
difficult
to
produce
it
of
a
good
quality
harding
preferred
therefore
to
manufacture
pyroxyle
that
is
to
say
guncotton
a
substance
in
which
cotton
is
not
indispensable
as
the
elementary
tissue
of
vegetables
may
be
used
and
this
is
found
in
an
almost
pure
state
not
only
in
cotton
but
in
the
textile
fiber
of
hemp
and
flax
in
paper
the
pith
of
the
elder
etc
now
the
elder
abounded
in
the
island
towards
the
mouth
of
red
creek
and
the
colonists
had
already
made
coffee
of
the
berries
of
these
shrubs
which
belong
to
the
family
of
the
caprifoliaceae
the
only
thing
to
be
collected
therefore
was
elderpith
for
as
to
the
other
substance
necessary
for
the
manufacture
of
pyroxyle
it
was
only
fuming
azotic
acid
now
harding
having
sulphuric
acid
at
his
disposal
had
already
been
easily
able
to
produce
azotic
acid
by
attacking
the
saltpeter
with
which
nature
supplied
him
he
accordingly
resolved
to
manufacture
and
employ
pyroxyle
although
it
has
some
inconveniences
that
is
to
say
a
great
inequality
of
effect
an
excessive
inflammability
since
it
takes
fire
at
one
hundred
and
seventy
degrees
instead
of
two
hundred
and
forty
and
lastly
an
instantaneous
deflagration
which
might
damage
the
firearms
on
the
other
hand
the
advantages
of
pyroxyle
consist
in
this
that
it
is
not
injured
by
damp
that
it
does
not
make
the
gunbarrels
dirty
and
that
its
force
is
four
times
that
of
ordinary
powder
to
make
pyroxyle
the
cotton
must
be
immersed
in
the
fuming
azotic
acid
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
washed
in
cold
water
and
dried
nothing
could
be
more
simple
cyrus
harding
had
only
at
his
disposal
the
ordinary
azotic
acid
and
not
the
fuming
or
monohydrate
azotic
acid
that
is
to
say
acid
which
emits
white
vapors
when
it
comes
in
contact
with
damp
air
but
by
substituting
for
the
latter
ordinary
azotic
acid
mixed
in
the
proportion
of
from
three
to
five
volumes
of
concentrated
sulphuric
acid
the
engineer
obtained
the
same
result
the
sportsmen
of
the
island
therefore
soon
had
a
perfectly
prepared
substance
which
employed
discreetly
produced
admirable
results
about
this
time
the
settlers
cleared
three
acres
of
the
plateau
and
the
rest
was
preserved
in
a
wild
state
for
the
benefit
of
the
onagers
several
excursions
were
made
into
the
jacamar
wood
and
the
forests
of
the
far
west
and
they
brought
back
from
thence
a
large
collection
of
wild
vegetables
spinach
cress
radishes
and
turnips
which
careful
culture
would
soon
improve
and
which
would
temper
the
regimen
on
which
the
settlers
had
till
then
subsisted
supplies
of
wood
and
coal
were
also
carted
each
excursion
was
at
the
same
time
a
means
of
improving
the
roads
which
gradually
became
smoother
under
the
wheels
of
the

the
rabbitwarren
still
continued
to

the
larder
of
granite
house
as
fortunately
it
was
situated
on
the
other
side
of
creek
glycerine
its
inhabitants
could
not
reach
the
plateau
nor
ravage
the
newlymade
plantation
the
oysterbed
among
the
rocks

frequently
renewed

furnished
excellent
molluscs
besides
that
the
fishing
either
in
the
lake
or
the
mercy
was
very
profitable
for
pencroft
had
made
some
lines
armed
with
iron
hooks
with
which
they
frequently
caught
fine
trout
and
a
species
of
fish
whose
silvery
sides
were
speckled
with
yellow
and
which
were
also
extremely
savory
master

who
was
skilled
in
the
culinary
art
knew
how
to
vary
agreeably
the
bill
of
fare
bread
alone
was
wanting
at
the
table
of
the
settlers
and
as
has
been
said
they
felt
this
privation
greatly
the
settlers
hunted
too
the
turtles
which
frequented
the
shores
of
cape
mandible
at
this
place
the

have
nothing
to

to
pick
them
up
but
not
being
contented
with
simply
the
produce
they
made
chase
after
the
producers
the
result
of
which
was
that
they
were
able
to
bring
back
to
granite
house
a
dozen
of
these

we
must
here
mention
another
fortunate
circumstance
by
which
new
stores
for
the
winter
were
laid
in
shoals
of
salmon
entered
the

and
ascended
the
country
for
several
miles
it
was
the

at
which
the
females
going
to
find
suitable
places
in
which
to
spawn
precede
the

and
make
a
great
noise
through
the
fresh
water
a
thousand
of
these
fish
which
measured
about
two
feet
and
a
half
in
length
came
up
the
river
and
a
large
quantity
were
retained
by
fixing
dams
across
the
stream
more
than
a
hundred
were
thus
taken
which
were
salted
and
stored
for
the
time
when
winter
freezing
up
the
streams
would
render
fishing
impracticable
by
this
time
the
intelligent
jup
was
raised
to
the
duty
of

had
been
dressed
in
a
jacket
white
linen
breeches
and
an
apron
the
pockets
of
which
were
his
delight
the
clever
orang
had
been
marvelously
trained
by
neb
and
any
one
would
have
said
that
the
negro
and
the
ape
understood
each
other
when
they
talked
together
jup
had
besides
a
real
affection
for
neb
and
neb
returned
it
when
his
services
were
not
required
either
for
carrying
wood
or
for
climbing
to
the
top
of
some
tree
jup
passed
the
greatest
part
of
his
time
in
the
kitchen
where
he
endeavored
to
imitate
neb
in
all
that
he
saw
him
do
the
black
showed
the
greatest
patience
and
even
extreme
zeal
in
instructing
his
pupil
and
the
pupil
exhibited
remarkable
intelligence
in
profiting
by
the
lessons
he
received
from
his
master
judge
then
of
the
pleasure
master
jup
gave
to
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
when
without
their
having
had
any
idea
of
it
he
appeared
one
day
napkin
on
his
arm
ready
to
wait
at
table
quick
attentive
he
acquitted
himself
perfectly
changing
the
plates
bringing
dishes
pouring
out
water
all
with
a
gravity
which
gave
intense
amusement
to
the
settlers
and
which
enraptured

nothing
was
heard
but
that
and
jup
without
ever
being
disconcerted
replied
to
every
one
watched
for
everything
and
he
shook
his
head
in
a
knowing
way
when
pencroft
referring
to
his
joke
of
the
first
day
said
to
him
decidedly
jup
your
wages
must
be
doubled
it
is
useless
to
say
that
the
orang
was
now
thoroughly
domesticated
at
granite
house
and
that
he
often
accompanied
his
masters
to
the
forest
without
showing
any
wish
to
leave
them
it
was
most
amusing
to
see
him
walking
with
a
stick
which
pencroft
had
given
him
and
which
he
carried
on
his
shoulder
like
a
gun
if
they
wished
to
gather
some
fruit
from
the
summit
of
a
tree
how
quickly
he
climbed
for
it
if
the
wheel
of
the
cart
stuck
in
the
mud
with
what
energy
did
jup
with
a
single
heave
of
his
shoulder
put
it
right
again
what
a
jolly
fellow
he
is
cried
pencroft
often
if
he
was
as
mischievous
as
he
is
good
there
would
be
no
doing
anything
with
him
it
was
towards
the
end
of
january
the
colonists
began
their
labors
in
the
center
of
the
island
it
had
been
decided
that
a
corral
should
be
established
near
the
sources
of
the
red
creek
at
the
foot
of
mount
franklin
destined
to
contain
the
ruminants
whose
presence
would
have
been
troublesome
at
granite
house
and
especially
for
the
musmons
who
were
to
supply
the
wool
for
the
settlers
winter
garments
each
morning
the
colony
sometimes
entire
but
more
often
represented
only
by
harding
herbert
and
pencroft
proceeded
to
the
sources
of
the
creek
a
distance
of
not
more
than
five
miles
by
the
newly
beaten
road
to
which
the
name
of
corral
road
had
been
given
there
a
site
was
chosen
at
the
back
of
the
southern
ridge
of
the
mountain
it
was
a
meadow
land
dotted
here
and
there
with
clumps
of
trees
and
watered
by
a
little
stream
which
sprung
from
the
slopes
which
closed
it
in
on
one
side
the
grass
was
fresh
and
it
was
not
too
much
shaded
by
the
trees
which
grew
about
it
this
meadow
was
to
be
surrounded
by
a
palisade
high
enough
to
prevent
even
the
most
agile
animals
from
leaping
over
this
enclosure
would
be
large
enough
to
contain
a
hundred
musmons
and
wild
goats
with
all
the
young
ones
they
might
produce
the
perimeter
of
the
corral
was
then
traced
by
the
engineer
and
they
would
then
have
proceeded
to
fell
the
trees
necessary
for
the
construction
of
the
palisade
but
as
the
opening
up
of
the
road
had
already
necessitated
the
sacrifice
of
a
considerable
number
those
were
brought
and
supplied
a
hundred
stakes
which
were
firmly
fixed
in
the
ground
the
construction
of
this
corral
did
not
take
less
than
three
weeks
for
besides
the
palisade
cyrus
harding
built
large
sheds
in
which
the
animals
could
take
shelter
these
buildings
had
also
to
be
made
very
strong
for
musmons
are
powerful
animals
and
their
first
fury
was
to
be
feared
the
stakes
sharpened
at
their
upper
end
and
hardened
by
fire
had
been
fixed
by
means
of
crossbars
and
at
regular
distances
props
assured
the
solidity
of
the
whole
the
corral
finished
a
raid
had
to
be
made
on
the
pastures
frequented
by
the
ruminants
this
was
done
on
the
7th
of
february
on
a
beautiful
summers
day
and
every
one
took
part
in
it
the
onagers
already
well
trained
were
ridden
by
spilett
and
herbert
and
were
of
great
use
the
maneuver
consisted
simply
in
surrounding
the
musmons
and
goats
and
gradually
narrowing
the
circle
around
them
cyrus
harding
pencroft
neb
and
jup
posted
themselves
in
different
parts
of
the
wood
while
the
two
cavaliers
and
top
galloped
in
a
radius
of
half
a
mile
round
the
corral
the
musmons
were
very
numerous
in
this
part
of
the
island
these
fine
animals
were
as
large
as
deer
their
horns
were
stronger
than
those
of
the
ram
and
their
graycolored
fleece
was
mixed
with
long
hair
this
hunting
day
was
very
fatiguing
such
going
and
coming
and
running
and
riding
and
shouting
of
a
hundred
musmons
which
had
been
surrounded
more
than
twothirds
escaped
but
at
last
thirty
of
these
animals
and
ten
wild
goats
were
gradually
driven
back
towards
the
corral
the
open
door
of
which
appearing
to
offer
a
means
of
escape
they
rushed
in
and
were
prisoners
in
short
the
result
was
satisfactory
and
the
settlers
had
no
reason
to
complain
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
flock
would
prosper
and
that
at
no
distant
time
not
only
wool
but
hides
would
be
abundant
that
evening
the
hunters
returned
to
granite
house
quite
exhausted
however
notwithstanding
their
fatigue
they
returned
the
next
day
to
visit
the
corral
the
prisoners
had
been
trying
to
overthrow
the
palisade
but
of
course
had
not
succeeded
and
were
not
long
in
becoming
more
tranquil
during
the
month
of
february
no
event
of
any
importance
occurred
the
daily
labors
were
pursued
methodically
and
as
well
as
improving
the
roads
to
the
corral
and
to
port
balloon
a
third
was
commenced
which
starting
from
the
enclosure
proceeded
towards
the
western
coast
the
yet
unknown
portion
of
lincoln
island
was
that
of
the
woodcovered
serpentine
peninsula
which
sheltered
the
wild
beasts
from
which
gideon
spilett
was
so
anxious
to
clear
their
domain
before
the
cold
season
should
appear
the
most
assiduous
care
was
given
to
the
cultivation
of
the
wild
plants
which
had
been
transplanted
from
the
forest
to
prospect
heights
herbert
never
returned
from
an
excursion
without
bringing
home
some
useful
vegetable
one
day
it
was
some
specimens
of
the
chicory
tribe
the
seeds
of
which
by
pressure
yield
an
excellent
oil
another
it
was
some
common
sorrel
whose
antiscorbutic
qualities
were
not
to
be
despised
then
some
of
those
precious
tubers
which
have
at
all
times
been
cultivated
in
south
america
potatoes
of
which
more
than
two
hundred
species
are
now
known
the
kitchen
garden
now
well
stocked
and
carefully
defended
from
the
birds
was
divided
into
small
beds
where
grew
lettuces
kidney
potatoes
sorrel
turnips
radishes
and
other
coneiferae
the
soil
on
the
plateau
was
particularly
fertile
and
it
was
hoped
that
the
harvests
would
be
abundant
they
had
also
a
variety
of
different
beverages
and
so
long
as
they
did
not

most
hard
to
please
would
have
had
no
reason
to
complain
to
the
oswego
tea
and
the
fermented
liquor
extracted
from
the
roots
of
the
dragonnier
harding
had
added
a
regular
beer
made
from
the
young
shoots
of
the
sprucefir
which
after
having
been
boiled
and
fermented
made
that
agreeable
drink
called
by
the
angloamericans
springbeer
towards
the
end
of
the
summer
the
poultryyard
was
possessed
of
a
couple
of
fine
bustards
which
belonged
to
the
houbara
species
characterized
by
a
sort
of
feathery
mantle
a
dozen
shovelers
whose
upper
mandible
was
prolonged
on
each
side
by
a
membraneous
appendage
and
also
some
magnificent
cocks
similar
to
the
mozambique
cocks
the
comb
caruncle
and
epidermis
being
black
so
far
everything
had
succeeded
thanks
to
the
activity
of
these
courageous
and
intelligent
men
nature
did
much
for
them
doubtless
but
faithful
to
the
great
precept
they
made
a
right
use
of
what
a
bountiful
providence
gave
them
after
the
heat
of
these
warm
summer
days
in
the
evening
when
their
work
was
finished
and
the
seabreeze
began
to
blow
they
liked
to
sit
on
the
edge
of
prospect
heights
in
a
sort
of
veranda
covered
with
creepers
which
neb
had
made
with
his
own
hands
there
they
talked
they
instructed
each
other
they
made
plans
and
the
rough
goodhumor
of
the
sailor
always
amused
this
little
world
in
which
the
most
perfect
harmony
had
never
ceased
to
reign
they
often
spoke
of
their
country
of
their
dear
and
great
america
what
was
the
result
of
the
war
of
secession
it
could
not
have
been
greatly
prolonged
richmond
had
doubtless
soon
fallen
into
the
hands
of
general
grant
the
taking
of
the
capital
of
the
confederates
must
have
been
the
last
action
of
this
terrible
struggle
now
the
north
had
triumphed
in
the
good
cause
how
welcome
would
have
been
a
newspaper
to
the
exiles
in
lincoln
island
for
eleven
months
all
communication
between
them
and
the
rest
of
their
fellowcreatures
had
been
interrupted
and
in
a
short
time
the
24th
of
march
would
arrive
the
anniversary
of
the
day
on
which
the
balloon
had
thrown
them
on
this
unknown
coast
they
were
then
mere
castaways
not
even
knowing
how
they
should
preserve
their
miserable
lives
from
the
fury
of
the
elements
and
now
thanks
to
the
knowledge
of
their
captain
and
their
own
intelligence
they
were
regular
colonists
furnished
with
arms
tools
and
instruments
they
had
been
able
to
turn
to
their
profit
the
animals
plants
and
minerals
of
the
island
that
is
to
say
the
three
kingdoms
of
nature
yes
they
often
talked
of
all
these
things
and
formed
still
more
plans
as
to
cyrus
harding
he
was
for
the
most
part
silent
and
listened
to
his
companions
more
often
than
he
spoke
to
them
sometimes
he
smiled
at
herberts
ideas
or
pencrofts
nonsense
but
always
and
everywhere
he
pondered
over
those
inexplicable
facts
that
strange
enigma
of
which
the
secret
still
escaped
him

9
the
weather
changed
during
the
first
week
of
march
there
had
been
a
full
moon
at
the
commencement
of
the
month
and
the
heat
was
excessive
the
atmosphere
was
felt
to
be
full
of
electricity
and
a
period
of
some
length
of
tempestuous
weather
was
to
be
feared
indeed
on
the
2nd
peals
of
thunder
were
heard
the
wind
blew
from
the
east
and
hail
rattled
against
the
facade
of
granite
house
like
volleys
of
grapeshot
the
door
and
windows
were
immediately
closed
or
everything
in
the
rooms
would
have
been
drenched
on
seeing
these
hailstones
some
of
which
were
the
size
of
a
pigeons
egg
pencrofts
first
thought
was
that
his
cornfield
was
in
serious
danger
he
directly
rushed
to
his
field
where
little
green
heads
were
already
appearing
and
by
means
of
a
great
cloth
he
managed
to
protect
his
crop
this
bad
weather
lasted
a
week
during
which
time
the
thunder
rolled
without
cessation
in
the
depths
of
the
sky
the
colonists
not
having
any
pressing
work
out
of
doors
profited
by
the
bad
weather
to
work
at
the
interior
of
granite
house
the
arrangement
of
which
was
becoming
more
complete
from
day
to
day
the
engineer
made
a
turninglathe
with
which
he
turned
several
articles
both
for
the
toilet
and
the
kitchen
particularly
buttons
the
want
of
which
was
greatly
felt
a
gunrack
had
been
made
for
the
firearms
which
were
kept
with
extreme
care
and
neither
tables
nor
cupboards
were
left
incomplete
they
sawed
they
planed
they
filed
they
turned
and
during
the
whole
of
this
bad
season
nothing
was
heard
but
the
grinding
of
tools
or
the
humming
of
the
turninglathe
which
responded
to
the
growling
of
the
thunder
master
jup
had
not
been
forgotten
and
he
occupied
a
room
at
the
back
near
the
storeroom
a
sort
of
cabin
with
a
cot
always
full
of
good
litter
which
perfectly
suited
his
taste
with
good
old
jup
there
is
never
any
quarreling
often
repeated
pencroft
never
any
improper
reply
what
a
servant
neb
what
a
servant
of
course
jup
was
now
well
used
to
service
he
brushed
their
clothes
he
turned
the
spit
he
waited
at
table
he
swept
the
rooms
he
gathered
wood
and
he
performed
another
admirable
piece
of
service
which
delighted
pencrofthe
never
went
to
sleep
without
first
coming
to
tuck
up
the
worthy
sailor
in
his
bed
as
to
the
health
of
the
members
of
the
colony
bipeds
or
bimana
quadrumana
or
quadrupeds
it
left
nothing
to
be
desired
with
their
life
in
the
open
air
on
this
salubrious
soil
under
that
temperate
zone
working
both
with
head
and
hands
they
could
not
suppose
that
illness
would
ever
attack
them
all
were
indeed
wonderfully
well
herbert
had
already
grown
two
inches
in
the
year
his
figure
was
forming
and
becoming
more
manly
and
he
promised
to
be
an
accomplished
man
physically
as
well
as
morally
besides
he
improved
himself
during
the
leisure
hours
which
manual
occupations
left
to
him
he
read
the
books
found
in
the
case
and
after
the
practical
lessons
which
were
taught
by
the
very
necessity
of
their
position
he
found
in
the
engineer
for
science
and
the
reporter
for
languages
masters
who
were
delighted
to
complete
his
education
the
tempest
ended
about
the
9th
of
march
but
the
sky
remained
covered
with
clouds
during
the
whole
of
this
last
summer
month
the
atmosphere
violently
agitated
by
the
electric
commotions
could
not
recover
its
former
purity
and
there
was
almost
invariably
rain
and
fog
except
for
three
or
four
fine
days
on
which
several
excursions
were
made
about
this
time
the
female
onager
gave
birth
to
a
young
one
which
belonged
to
the
same
sex
as
its
mother
and
which
throve
capitally
in
the
corral
the
flock
of
musmons
had
also
increased
and
several
lambs
already
bleated
in
the
sheds
to
the
great
delight
of
neb
and
herbert
who
had
each
their
favorite
among
these
newcomers
an
attempt
was
also
made
for
the
domestication
of
the
peccaries
which
succeeded
well
a
sty
was
constructed
under
the
poultryyard
and
soon
contained
several
young
ones
in
the
way
to
become
civilized
that
is
to
say
to
become
fat
under
nebs
care
master
jup
entrusted
with
carrying
them
their
daily
nourishment
leavings
from
the
kitchen
etc
acquitted
himself
conscientiously
of
his
task
he
sometimes
amused
himself
at
the
expense
of
his
little
pensioners
by
tweaking
their
tails
but
this
was
mischief
and
not
wickedness
for
these
little
twisted
tails
amused
him
like
a
plaything
and
his
instinct
was
that
of
a
child
one
day
in
this
month
of
march
pencroft
talking
to
the
engineer
reminded
cyrus
harding
of
a
promise
which
the
latter
had
not
as
yet
had
time
to
fulfil
you
once
spoke
of
an
apparatus
which
would
take
the
place
of
the
long
ladders
at
granite
house
captain
said
he
wont
you
make
it
some
day
nothing
will
be
easier
but
is
this
a
really
useful
thing
certainly
captain
after
we
have
given
ourselves
necessaries
let
us
think
a
little
of
luxury
for
us
it
may
be
luxury
if
you
like
but
for
things
it
is
necessary
it
isnt
very
convenient
to
climb
up
a
long
ladder
when
one
is
heavily
loaded
well
pencroft
we
will
try
to
please
you
replied
cyrus
harding
but
you
have
no
machine
at
your
disposal
we
will
make
one
a
steam
machine
no
a
water
machine
and
indeed
to
work
his
apparatus
there
was
already
a
natural
force
at
the
disposal
of
the
engineer
which
could
be
used
without
great
difficulty
for
this
it
was
enough
to
augment
the
flow
of
the
little
stream
which
supplied
the
interior
of
granite
house
with
water
the
opening
among
the
stones
and
grass
was
then
increased
thus
producing
a
strong
fall
at
the
bottom
of
the
passage
the
overflow
from
which
escaped
by
the
inner
well
below
this
fall
the
engineer
fixed
a
cylinder
with
paddles
which
was
joined
on
the
exterior
with
a
strong
cable
rolled
on
a
wheel
supporting
a
basket
in
this
way
by
means
of
a
long
rope
reaching
to
the
ground
which
enabled
them
to
regulate
the
motive
power
they
could
rise
in
the
basket
to
the
door
of
granite
house
it
was
on
the
17th
of
march
that
the
lift
acted
for
the
first
time
and
gave
universal
satisfaction
henceforward
all
the
loads
wood
coal
provisions
and
even
the
settlers
themselves
were
hoisted
by
this
simple
system
which
replaced
the
primitive
ladder
and
as
may
be
supposed
no
one
thought
of
regretting
the
change
top
particularly
was
enchanted
with
this
improvement
for
he
had
not
and
never
could
have
possessed
master
jups
skill
in
climbing
ladders
and
often
it
was
on
nebs
back
or
even
on
that
of
the
orang
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
make
the
ascent
to
granite
house
about
this
time
too
cyrus
harding
attempted
to
manufacture
glass
and
he
at
first
put
the
old
potterykiln
to
this
new
use
there
were
some
difficulties
to
be
encountered
but
after
several
fruitless
attempts
he
succeeded
in
setting
up
a
glass
manufactory
which
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
his
usual
assistants
did
not
leave
for
several
days
as
to
the
substances
used
in
the
composition
of
glass
they
are
simply
sand
chalk
and
soda
either
carbonate
or
sulphate
now
the
beach
supplied
sand
lime
supplied
chalk
seaweeds
supplied
soda
pyrites
supplied
sulphuric
acid
and
the
ground
supplied
coal
to
heat
the
kiln
to
the
wishedfor
temperature
cyrus
harding
thus
soon
had
everything
ready
for
setting
to
work
the
tool
the
manufacture
of
which
presented
the
most
difficulty
was
the
pipe
of
the
glassmaker
an
iron
tube
five
or
six
feet
long
which
collects
on
one
end
the
material
in
a
state
of
fusion
but
by
means
of
a
long
thin
piece
of
iron
rolled
up
like
the
barrel
of
a
gun
pencroft
succeeded
in
making
a
tube
soon
ready
for
use
on
the
28th
of
march
the
tube
was
heated
a
hundred
parts
of
sand
thirtyfive
of
chalk
forty
of
sulphate
of
soda
mixed
with
two
or
three
parts
of
powdered
coal
composed
the
substance
which
was
placed
in
crucibles
when
the
high
temperature
of
the
oven
had
reduced
it
to
a
liquid
or
rather
a
pasty
state
cyrus
harding
collected
with
the
tube
a
quantity
of
the
paste
he
turned
it
about
on
a
metal
plate
previously
arranged
so
as
to
give
it
a
form
suitable
for
blowing
then
he
passed
the
tube
to
herbert
telling
him
to
blow
at
the
other
extremity
and
herbert
swelling
out
his
cheeks
blew
so
much
and
so
well
into
the
tubetaking
care
to
twirl
it
round
at
the
same
timethat
his
breath
dilated
the
glassy
mass
other
quantities
of
the
substance
in
a
state
of
fusion
were
added
to
the
first
and
in
a
short
time
the
result
was
a
bubble
which
measured
a
foot
in
diameter
harding
then
took
the
tube
out
of
herberts
hands
and
giving
it
a
pendulous
motion
he
ended
by
lengthening
the
malleable
bubble
so
as
to
give
it
a
cylindroconic
shape
the
blowing
operation
had
given
a
cylinder
of
glass
terminated
by
two
hemispheric
caps
which
were
easily
detached
by
means
of
a
sharp
iron
dipped
in
cold
water
then
by
the
same
proceeding
this
cylinder
was
cut
lengthways
and
after
having
been
rendered
malleable
by
a
second
heating
it
was
extended
on
a
plate
and
spread
out
with
a
wooden
roller
the
first
pane
was
thus
manufactured
and
they
had
only
to
perform
this
operation
fifty
times
to
have
fifty
panes
the
windows
at
granite
house
were
soon
furnished
with
panes
not
very
white
perhaps
but
still
sufficiently
transparent
as
to
bottles
and
tumblers
that
was
only
play
they
were
satisfied
with
them
besides
just
as
they
came
from
the
end
of
the
tube
pencroft
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
blow
in
his
turn
and
it
was
great
fun
for
him
but
he
blew
so
hard
that
his
productions
took
the
most
ridiculous
shapes
which
he
admired
immensely
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
while
hunting
one
day
had
entered
the
forest
of
the
far
west
on
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
and
as
usual
the
lad
was
asking
a
thousand
questions
of
the
engineer
who
answered
them
heartily
now
as
harding
was
not
a
sportsman
and
as
on
the
other
side
herbert
was
talking
chemistry
and
natural
philosophy
numbers
of
kangaroos
capybaras
and
agouties
came
within
range
which
however
escaped
the
lads
gun
the
consequence
was
that
the
day
was
already
advanced
and
the
two
hunters
were
in
danger
of
having
made
a
useless
excursion
when
herbert
stopping
and
uttering
a
cry
of
joy
exclaimed
oh
captain
harding
do
you
see
that
tree
and
he
pointed
to
a
shrub
rather
than
a
tree
for
it
was
composed
of
a
single
stem
covered
with
a
scaly
bark
which
bore
leaves
streaked
with
little
parallel
veins
and
what
is
this
tree
which
resembles
a
little
palm
asked
harding
it
is
a
cycas
revoluta
of
which
i
have
a
picture
in
our
dictionary
of
natural
history
said
herbert
but
i
cant
see
any
fruit
on
this
shrub
observed
his
companion
no
captain
replied
herbert
but
its
stem
contains
a
flour
with
which
nature
has
provided
us
all
ready
ground
it
is
then
the
breadtree
yes
the
breadtree
well
my
boy
replied
the
engineer
this
is
a
valuable
discovery
since
our
wheat
harvest
is
not
yet
ripe
i
hope
that
you
are
not
mistaken
herbert
was
not
mistaken
he
broke
the
stem
of
a
cycas
which
was
composed
of
a
glandulous
tissue
containing
a
quantity
of
floury
pith
traversed
with
woody
fiber
separated
by
rings
of
the
same
substance
arranged
concentrically
with
this
fecula
was
mingled
a
mucilaginous
juice
of
disagreeable
flavor
but
which
it
would
be
easy
to
get
rid
of
by
pressure
this
cellular
substance
was
regular
flour
of
a
superior
quality
extremely
nourishing
its
exportation
was
formerly
forbidden
by
the
japanese
laws
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
after
having
examined
that
part
of
the
far
west
where
the
cycas
grew
took
their
bearings
and
returned
to
granite
house
where
they
made
known
their
discovery
the
next
day
the
settlers
went
to
collect
some
and
returned
to
granite
house
with
an
ample
supply
of
cycas
stems
the
engineer
constructed
a
press
with
which
to
extract
the
mucilaginous
juice
mingled
with
the
fecula
and
he
obtained
a
large
quantity
of
flour
which
neb
soon
transformed
into
cakes
and
puddings
this
was
not
quite
real
wheaten
bread
but
it
was
very
like
it
now
too
the
onager
the
goats
and
the
sheep
in
the
corral
furnished
daily
the
milk
necessary
to
the
colony
the
cart
or
rather
a
sort
of
light
carriole
which
had
replaced
it
made
frequent
journeys
to
the
corral
and
when
it
was
pencrofts
turn
to
go
he
took
jup
and
let
him
drive
and
jup
cracking
his
whip
acquitted
himself
with
his
customary
intelligence
everything
prospered
as
well
in
the
corral
as
in
granite
house
and
certainly
the
settlers
if
it
had
not
been
that
they
were
so
far
from
their
native
land
had
no
reason
to
complain
they
were
so
well
suited
to
this
life
and
were
besides
so
accustomed
to
the
island
that
they
could
not
have
left
its
hospitable
soil
without
regret
and
yet
so
deeply
is
the
love
of
his
country
implanted
in
the
heart
of
man
that
if
a
ship
had
unexpectedly
come
in
sight
of
the
island
the
colonists
would
have
made
signals
would
have
attracted
her
attention
and
would
have
departed
it
was
the
1st
of
april
a
sunday
easter
day
which
harding
and
his
companions
sanctified
by
rest
and
prayer
the
day
was
fine
such
as
an
october
day
in
the
northern
hemisphere
might
be
all
towards
the
evening
after
dinner
were
seated
under
the
veranda
on
the
edge
of
prospect
heights
and
they
were
watching
the
darkness
creeping
up
from
the
horizon
some
cups
of
the
infusion
of
elderberries
which
took
the
place
of
coffee
had
been
served
by
neb
they
were
speaking
of
the
island
and
of
its
isolated
situation
in
the
pacific
which
led
gideon
spilett
to
say
my
dear
cyrus
have
you
ever
since
you
possessed
the
sextant
found
in
the
case
again
taken
the
position
of
our
island
no
replied
the
engineer
but
it
would
perhaps
be
a
good
thing
to
do
it
with
this
instrument
which
is
more
perfect
than
that
which
you
before
used
what
is
the
good
said
pencroft
the
island
is
quite
comfortable
where
it
is
well
who
knows
returned
the
reporter
who
knows
but
that
we
may
be
much
nearer
inhabited
land
than
we
think
we
shall
know
tomorrow
replied
cyrus
harding
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
occupations
which
left
me
no
leisure
we
should
have
known
it
already
good
said
pencroft
the
captain
is
too
good
an
observer
to
be
mistaken
and
if
it
has
not
moved
from
its
place
the
island
is
just
where
he
put
it
we
shall
see
on
the
next
day
therefore
by
means
of
the
sextant
the
engineer
made
the
necessary
observations
to
verify
the
position
which
he
had
already
obtained
and
this
was
the
result
of
his
operation
his
first
observation
had
given
him
the
situation
of
lincoln
island
in
west
longitude
from
150deg
to
155deg
in
south
latitude
from
30deg
to
35deg
the
second
gave
exactly
in
longitude
150deg
30
in
south
latitude
34deg
57
so
then
notwithstanding
the
imperfection
of
his
apparatus
cyrus
harding
had
operated
with
so
much
skill
that
his
error
did
not
exceed
five
degrees
now
said
gideon
spilett
since
we
possess
an
atlas
as
well
as
a
sextant
let
us
see
my
dear
cyrus
the
exact
position
which
lincoln
island
occupies
in
the
pacific
herbert
fetched
the
atlas
and
the
map
of
the
pacific
was
opened
and
the
engineer
compass
in
hand
prepared
to
determine
their
position
suddenly
the
compasses
stopped
and
he
exclaimed
but
an
island
exists
in
this
part
of
the
pacific
already
an
island
cried
pencroft
tabor
island
an
important
island
no
an
islet
lost
in
the
pacific
and
which
perhaps
has
never
been
visited
well
we
will
visit
it
said
pencroft
we
yes
captain
we
will
build
a
decked
boat
and
i
will
undertake
to
steer
her
at
what
distance
are
we
from
this
tabor
island
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
the
northeast
replied
harding
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
and
whats
that
returned
pencroft
in
fortyeight
hours
with
a
good
wind
we
should
sight
it
and
on
this
reply
it
was
decided
that
a
vessel
should
be
constructed
in
time
to
be
launched
towards
the
month
of
next
october
on
the
return
of
the
fine
season
chapter
10
when
pencroft
had
once
got
a
plan
in
his
head
he
had
no
peace
till
it
was
executed
now
he
wished
to
visit
tabor
island
and
as
a
boat
of
a
certain
size
was
necessary
for
this
voyage
he
determined
to
build
one
what
wood
should
he
employ
elm
or
fir
both
of
which
abounded
in
the
island
they
decided
for
the
fir
as
being
easy
to
work
but
which
stands
water
as
well
as
the
elm
these
details
settled
it
was
agreed
that
since
the
fine
season
would
not
return
before
six
months
cyrus
harding
and
pencroft
should
work
alone
at
the
boat
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
were
to
continue
to
hunt
and
neither
neb
nor
master
jup
his
assistant
were
to
leave
the
domestic
duties
which
had
devolved
upon
them
directly
the
trees
were
chosen
they
were
felled
stripped
of
their
branches
and
sawn
into
planks
as
well
as
sawyers
would
have
been
able
to
do
it
a
week
after
in
the
recess
between
the
chimneys
and
the
cliff
a
dockyard
was
prepared
and
a
keel
fiveandthirty
feet
long
furnished
with
a
sternpost
at
the
stern
and
a
stem
at
the
bows
lay
along
the
sand
cyrus
harding
was
not
working
in
the
dark
at
this
new
trade
he
knew
as
much
about
shipbuilding
as
about
nearly
everything
else
and
he
had
at
first
drawn
the
model
of
his
ship
on
paper
besides
he
was
ably
seconded
by
pencroft
who
having
worked
for
several
years
in
a
dockyard
in
brooklyn
knew
the
practical
part
of
the
trade
it
was
not
until
after
careful
calculation
and
deep
thought
that
the
timbers
were
laid
on
the
keel
pencroft
as
may
be
believed
was
all
eagerness
to
carry
out
his
new
enterprise
and
would
not
leave
his
work
for
an
instant
a
single
thing
had
the
honor
of
drawing
him
but
for
one
day
only
from
his
dockyard
this
was
the
second
wheatharvest
which
was
gathered
in
on
the
15th
of
april
it
was
as
much
a
success
as
the
first
and
yielded
the
number
of
grains
which
had
been
predicted
five
bushels
captain
said
pencroft
after
having
scrupulously
measured
his
treasure
five
bushels
replied
the
engineer
and
a
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
grains
a
bushel
will
make
six
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
grains
well
we
will
sow
them
all
this
time
said
the
sailor
except
a
little
in
reserve
yes
pencroft
and
if
the
next
crop
gives
a
proportionate
yield
we
shall
have
four
thousand
bushels
and
shall
we
eat
bread
we
shall
eat
bread
but
we
must
have
a
mill
we
will
make
one
the
third
cornfield
was
very
much
larger
than
the
two
first
and
the
soil
prepared
with
extreme
care
received
the
precious
seed
that
done
pencroft
returned
to
his
work
during
this
time
spilett
and
herbert
hunted
in
the
neighborhood
and
they
ventured
deep
into
the
still
unknown
parts
of
the
far
west
their
guns
loaded
with
ball
ready
for
any
dangerous
emergency
it
was
a
vast
thicket
of
magnificent
trees
crowded
together
as
if
pressed
for
room
the
exploration
of
these
dense
masses
of
wood
was
difficult
in
the
extreme
and
the
reporter
never
ventured
there
without
the
pocketcompass
for
the
sun
scarcely
pierced
through
the
thick
foliage
and
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
for
them
to
retrace
their
way
it
naturally
happened
that
game
was
more
rare
in
those
situations
where
there
was
hardly
sufficient
room
to
move
two
or
three
large
herbivorous
animals
were
however
killed
during
the
last
fortnight
of
april
these
were
koalas
specimens
of
which
the
settlers
had
already
seen
to
the
north
of
the
lake
and
which
stupidly
allowed
themselves
to
be
killed
among
the
thick
branches
of
the
trees
in
which
they
took
refuge
their
skins
were
brought
back
to
granite
house
and
there
by
the
help
of
sulphuric
acid
they
were
subjected
to
a
sort
of
tanning
process
which
rendered
them
capable
of
being
used
on
the
30th
of
april
the
two
sportsmen
were
in
the
depth
of
the
far
west
when
the
reporter
preceding
herbert
a
few
paces
arrived
in
a
sort
of
clearing
into
which
the
trees
more
sparsely
scattered
had
permitted
a
few
rays
to
penetrate
gideon
spilett
was
at
first
surprised
at
the
odor
which
exhaled
from
certain
plants
with
straight
stalks
round
and
branchy
bearing
grapelike
clusters
of
flowers
and
very
small
berries
the
reporter
broke
off
one
or
two
of
these
stalks
and
returned
to
the
lad
to
whom
he
said
what
can
this
be
herbert
well
mr
spilett
said
herbert
this
is
a
treasure
which
will
secure
you
pencrofts
gratitude
forever
is
it
tobacco
yes
and
though
it
may
not
be
of
the
first
quality
it
is
none
the
less
tobacco
oh
good
old
pencroft
wont
he
be
pleased
but
we
must
not
let
him
smoke
it
all
he
must
give
us
our
share
ah
an
idea
occurs
to
me
mr
spilett
replied
herbert
dont
let
us
say
anything
to
pencroft
yet
we
will
prepare
these
leaves
and
one
fine
day
we
will
present
him
with
a
pipe
already
filled
all
right
herbert
and
on
that
day
our
worthy
companion
will
have
nothing
left
to
wish
for
in
this
world
the
reporter
and
the
lad
secured
a
good
store
of
the
precious
plant
and
then
returned
to
granite
house
where
they
smuggled
it
in
with
as
much
precaution
as
if
pencroft
had
been
the
most
vigilant
and
severe
of
customhouse
officers
cyrus
harding
and
neb
were
taken
into
confidence
and
the
sailor
suspected
nothing
during
the
whole
time
necessarily
somewhat
long
which
was
required
in
order
to
dry
the
small
leaves
chop
them
up
and
subject
them
to
a
certain
torrefaction
on
hot
stones
this
took
two
months
but
all
these
manipulations
were
successfully
carried
on
unknown
to
pencroft
for
occupied
with
the
construction
of
his
boat
he
only
returned
to
granite
house
at
the
hour
of
rest
for
some
days
they
had
observed
an
enormous
animal
two
or
three
miles
out
in
the
open
sea
swimming
around
lincoln
island
this
was
a
whale
of
the
largest
size
which
apparently
belonged
to
the
southern
species
called
the
cape
whale
what
a
lucky
chance
it
would
be
if
we
could
capture
it
cried
the
sailor
ah
if
we
only
had
a
proper
boat
and
a
good
harpoon
i
would
say
after
the
beast
for
he
would
be
well
worth
the
trouble
of
catching
well
pencroft
observed
harding
i
should
much
like
to
watch
you
handling
a
harpoon
it
would
be
very
interesting
i
am
astonished
said
the
reporter
to
see
a
whale
in
this
comparatively
high
latitude
why
so
mr
spilett
replied
herbert
we
are
exactly
in
that
part
of
the
pacific
which
english
and
american
whalemen
call
the
whale
field
and
it
is
here
between
new
zealand
and
south
america
that
the
whales
of
the
southern
hemisphere
are
met
with
in
the
greatest
numbers
and
pencroft
returned
to
his
work
not
without
uttering
a
sigh
of
regret
for
every
sailor
is
a
born
fisherman
and
if
the
pleasure
of
fishing
is
in
exact
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
animal
one
can
judge
how
a
whaler
feels
in
sight
of
a
whale
and
if
this
had
only
been
for
pleasure
but
they
could
not
help
feeling
how
valuable
such
a
prize
would
have
been
to
the
colony
for
the
oil
fat
and
bones
would
have
been
put
to
many
uses
now
it
happened
that
this
whale
appeared
to
have
no
wish
to
leave
the
waters
of
the
island
therefore
whether
from
the
windows
of
granite
house
or
from
prospect
heights
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
when
they
were
not
hunting
or
neb
unless
presiding
over
his
fires
never
left
the
telescope
but
watched
all
the
animals
movements
the
cetacean
having
entered
far
into
union
bay
made
rapid
furrows
across
it
from
mandible
cape
to
claw
cape
propelled
by
its
enormously
powerful
flukes
on
which
it
supported
itself
and
making
its
way
through
the
water
at
the
rate
little
short
of
twelve
knots
sometimes
also
it
approached
so
near
to
the
island
that
it
could
be
clearly
distinguished
it
was
the
southern
whale
which
is
completely
black
the
head
being
more
depressed
than
that
of
the
northern
whale
they
could
also
see
it
throwing
up
from
its
airholes
to
a
great
height
a
cloud
of
vapor
or
of
water
for
strange
as
it
may
appear
naturalists
and
whalers
are
not
agreed
on
this
subject
is
it
air
or
is
it
water
which
is
thus
driven
out
it
is
generally
admitted
to
be
vapor
which
condensing
suddenly
by
contact
with
the
cold
air
falls
again
as
rain
however
the
presence
of
this
mammifer
preoccupied
the
colonists
it
irritated
pencroft
especially
as
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
while
at
work
he
ended
by
longing
for
it
like
a
child
for
a
thing
which
it
has
been
denied
at
night
he
talked
about
it
in
his
sleep
and
certainly
if
he
had
had
the
means
of
attacking
it
if
the
sloop
had
been
in
a
fit
state
to
put
to
sea
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
set
out
in
pursuit
but
what
the
colonists
could
not
do
for
themselves
chance
did
for
them
and
on
the
3rd
of
may
shouts
from
neb
who
had
stationed
himself
at
the
kitchen
window
announced
that
the
whale
was
stranded
on
the
beach
of
the
island
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
who
were
just
about
to
set
out
hunting
left
their
guns
pencroft
threw
down
his
ax
and
harding
and
neb
joining
their
companions
all
rushed
towards
the
scene
of
action
the
stranding
had
taken
place
on
the
beach
of
flotsam
point
three
miles
from
granite
house
and
at
high
tide
it
was
therefore
probable
that
the
cetacean
would
not
be
able
to
extricate
itself
easily
at
any
rate
it
was
best
to
hasten
so
as
to
cut
off
its
retreat
if
necessary
they
ran
with
pickaxes
and
irontipped
poles
in
their
hands
passed
over
the
mercy
bridge
descended
the
right
bank
of
the
river
along
the
beach
and
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
the
settlers
were
close
to
the
enormous
animal
above
which
flocks
of
birds
already
hovered
what
a
monster
cried
neb
and
the
exclamation
was
natural
for
it
was
a
southern
whale
eighty
feet
long
a
giant
of
the
species
probably
not
weighing
less
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
in
the
meanwhile
the
monster
thus
stranded
did
not
move
nor
attempt
by
struggling
to
regain
the
water
while
the
tide
was
still
high
it
was
dead
and
a
harpoon
was
sticking
out
of
its
left
side
there
are
whalers
in
these
quarters
then
said
gideon
spilett
directly
oh
mr
spilett
that
doesnt
prove
anything
replied
pencroft
whales
have
been
known
to
go
thousands
of
miles
with
a
harpoon
in
the
side
and
this
one
might
even
have
been
struck
in
the
north
of
the
atlantic
and
come
to
die
in
the
south
of
the
pacific
and
it
would
be
nothing
astonishing
pencroft
having
torn
the
harpoon
from
the
animals
side
read
this
inscription
on
it
maria
stella
vineyard
a
vessel
from
the
vineyard
a
ship
from
my
country
he
cried
the
maria
stella
a
fine
whaler
pon
my
word
i
know
her
well
oh
my
friends
a
vessel
from
the
vineyarda
whaler
from
the
vineyard
and
the
sailor
brandishing
the
harpoon
repeated
not
without
emotion
the
name
which
he
loved
so
wellthe
name
of
his
birthplace
but
as
it
could
not
be
expected
that
the
maria
stella
would
come
to
reclaim
the
animal
harpooned
by
her
they
resolved
to
begin
cutting
it
up
before
decomposition
should
commence
the
birds
who
had
watched
this
rich
prey
for
several
days
had
determined
to
take
possession
of
it
without
further
delay
and
it
was
necessary
to
drive
them
off
by
firing
at
them
repeatedly
the
whale
was
a
female
and
a
large
quantity
of
milk
was
taken
from
it
which
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
naturalist
duffenbach
might
pass
for
cows
milk
and
indeed
it
differs
from
it
neither
in
taste
color
nor
density
pencroft
had
formerly
served
on
board
a
whalingship
and
he
could
methodically
direct
the
operation
of
cutting
up
a
sufficiently
disagreeable
operation
lasting
three
days
but
from
which
the
settlers
did
not
flinch
not
even
gideon
spilett
who
as
the
sailor
said
would
end
by
making
a
real
good
castaway
the
blubber
cut
in
parallel
slices
of
two
feet
and
a
half
in
thickness
then
divided
into
pieces
which
might
weigh
about
a
thousand
pounds
each
was
melted
down
in
large
earthen
pots
brought
to
the
spot
for
they
did
not
wish
to
taint
the
environs
of
granite
house
and
in
this
fusion
it
lost
nearly
a
third
of
its
weight
but
there
was
an
immense
quantity
of
it
the
tongue
alone
yielded
six
thousand
pounds
of
oil
and
the
lower
lip
four
thousand
then
besides
the
fat
which
would
insure
for
a
long
time
a
store
of
stearine
and
glycerine
there
were
still
the
bones
for
which
a
use
could
doubtless
be
found
although
there
were
neither
umbrellas
nor
stays
used
at
granite
house
the
upper
part
of
the
mouth
of
the
cetacean
was
indeed
provided
on
both
sides
with
eight
hundred
horny
blades
very
elastic
of
a
fibrous
texture
and
fringed
at
the
edge
like
great
combs
at
which
the
teeth
six
feet
long
served
to
retain
the
thousands
of
animalculae
little
fish
and
molluscs
on
which
the
whale
fed
the
operation
finished
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
operators
the
remains
of
the
animal
were
left
to
the
birds
who
would
soon
make
every
vestige
of
it
disappear
and
their
usual
daily
occupations
were
resumed
by
the
inmates
of
granite
house
however
before
returning
to
the
dockyard
cyrus
harding
conceived
the
idea
of
fabricating
certain
machines
which
greatly
excited
the
curiosity
of
his
companions
he
took
a
dozen
of
the
whales
bones
cut
them
into
six
equal
parts
and
sharpened
their
ends
this
machine
is
not
my
own
invention
and
it
is
frequently
employed
by
the
aleutian
hunters
in
russian
america
you
see
these
bones
my
friends
well
when
it
freezes
i
will
bend
them
and
then
wet
them
with
water
till
they
are
entirely
covered
with
ice
which
will
keep
them
bent
and
i
will
strew
them
on
the
snow
having
previously
covered
them
with
fat
now
what
will
happen
if
a
hungry
animal
swallows
one
of
these
baits
why
the
heat
of
his
stomach
will
melt
the
ice
and
the
bone
springing
straight
will
pierce
him
with
its
sharp
points
well
i
do
call
that
ingenious
said
pencroft
and
it
will
spare
the
powder
and
shot
rejoined
cyrus
harding
that
will
be
better
than
traps
added
neb
in
the
meanwhile
the
boatbuilding
progressed
and
towards
the
end
of
the
month
half
the
planking
was
completed
it
could
already
be
seen
that
her
shape
was
excellent
and
that
she
would
sail
well
pencroft
worked
with
unparalleled
ardor
and
only
a
sturdy
frame
could
have
borne
such
fatigue
but
his
companions
were
preparing
in
secret
a
reward
for
his
labors
and
on
the
31st
of
may
he
was
to
meet
with
one
of
the
greatest
joys
of
his
life
on
that
day
after
dinner
just
as
he
was
about
to
leave
the
table
pencroft
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
it
was
the
hand
of
gideon
spilett
who
said
one
moment
master
pencroft
you
mustnt
sneak
off
like
that
youve
forgotten
your
dessert
thank
you
mr
spilett
replied
the
sailor
i
am
going
back
to
my
work
well
a
cup
of
coffee
my
friend
nothing
more
a
pipe
then
pencroft
jumped
up
and
his
great
goodnatured
face
grew
pale
when
he
saw
the
reporter
presenting
him
with
a
readyfilled
pipe
and
herbert
with
a
glowing
coal
the
sailor
endeavored
to
speak
but
could
not
get
out
a
word
so
seizing
the
pipe
he
carried
it
to
his
lips
then
applying
the
coal
he
drew
five
or
six
great
whiffs
a
fragrant
blue
cloud
soon
arose
and
from
its
depths
a
voice
was
heard
repeating
excitedly
tobacco
real
tobacco
yes
pencroft
returned
cyrus
harding
and
very
good
tobacco
too
o
divine
providence
sacred
author
of
all
things
cried
the
sailor
nothing
more
is
now
wanting
to
our
island
and
pencroft
smoked
and
smoked
and
smoked
and
who
made
this
discovery
he

at

mr
spilett
exclaimed
the
sailor
seizing
the
reporter
and
clasping
him
to
his
breast
with
such
a
squeeze
that
he
had
never
felt
anything
like
it
before
oh
pencroft
said
spilett
recovering
his
breath
at
last
a
truce
for
one
moment
you
must
share
your
gratitude
with
herbert
who
recognized
the
plant
with
cyrus
who
prepared
it
and
with
neb
who
took
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
keep
our
secret
well
my
friends
i
will
repay
you
some
day
replied
the
sailor
now
we
are
friends
for
life
chapter
11
winter
arrived
with
the
month
of
june
which
is
the
december
of
the
northern
zones
and
the
great
business
was
the
making
of
warm
and
solid
clothing
the
musmons
in
the
corral
had
been
stripped
of
their
wool
and
this
precious
textile
material
was
now
to
be
transformed
into
stuff
of
course
cyrus
harding
having
at
his
disposal
neither
carders
combers
polishers
stretchers
twisters
mulejenny
nor
selfacting
machine
to
spin
the
wool
nor
loom
to
weave
it
was
obliged
to
proceed
in
a
simpler
way
so
as
to
do
without
spinning
and
weaving
and
indeed
he
proposed
to
make
use
of
the
property
which
the
filaments
of
wool
possess
when
subjected
to
a
powerful
pressure
of
mixing
together
and
of
manufacturing
by
this
simple
process
the
material
called
felt
this
felt
could
then
be
obtained
by
a
simple
operation
which
if
it
diminished
the
flexibility
of
the
stuff
increased
its
power
of
retaining
heat
in
proportion
now
the
wool
furnished
by
the
musmons
was
composed
of
very
short
hairs
and
was
in
a
good
condition
to
be
felted
the
engineer
aided
by
his
companions
including
pencroft
who
was
once
more
obliged
to
leave
his
boat
commenced
the
preliminary
operations
the
subject
of
which
was
to
rid
the
wool
of
that
fat
and
oily
substance
with
which
it
is
impregnated
and
which
is
called
grease
this
cleaning
was
done
in
vats
filled
with
water
which
was
maintained
at
the
temperature
of
seventy
degrees
and
in
which
the
wool
was
soaked
for
fourandtwenty
hours
it
was
then
thoroughly
washed
in
baths
of
soda
and
when
sufficiently
dried
by
pressure
it
was
in
a
state
to
be
compressed
that
is
to
say
to
produce
a
solid
material
rough
no
doubt
and
such
as
would
have
no
value
in
a
manufacturing
center
of
europe
or
america
but
which
would
be
highly
esteemed
in
the
lincoln
island
markets
this
sort
of
material
must
have
been
known
from
the
most
ancient
times
and
in
fact
the
first
woolen
stuffs
were
manufactured
by
the
process
which
harding
was
now
about
to
employ
where
hardings
engineering
qualifications
now
came
into
play
was
in
the
construction
of
the
machine
for
pressing
the
wool
for
he
knew
how
to
turn
ingeniously
to
profit
the
mechanical
force
hitherto
unused
which
the
waterfall
on
the
beach
possessed
to
move
a
fullingmill
nothing
could
be
more
rudimentary
the
wool
was
placed
in
troughs
and
upon
it
fell
in
turns
heavy
wooden
mallets
such
was
the
machine
in
question
and
such
it
had
been
for
centuries
until
the
time
when
the
mallets
were
replaced
by
cylinders
of
compression
and
the
material
was
no
longer
subjected
to
beating
but
to
regular
rolling
the
operation
ably
directed
by
cyrus
harding
was
a
complete
success
the
wool
previously
impregnated
with
a
solution
of
soap
intended
on
the
one
hand
to
facilitate
the
interlacing
the
compression
and
the
softening
of
the
wool
and
on
the
other
to
prevent
its
diminution
by
the
beating
issued
from
the
mill
in
the
shape
of
thick
felt
cloth
the
roughnesses
with
which
the
staple
of
wool
is
naturally
filled
were
so
thoroughly
entangled
and
interlaced
together
that
a
material
was
formed
equally
suitable
either
for
garments
or
bedclothes
it
was
certainly
neither
merino
muslin
cashmere
rep
satin
alpaca
cloth
nor
flannel
it
was
lincolnian
felt
and
lincoln
island
possessed
yet
another
manufacture
the
colonists
had
now
warm
garments
and
thick
bedclothes
and
they
could
without
fear
await
the
approach
of
the
winter
of
186667
the
severe
cold
began
to
be
felt
about
the
20th
of
june
and
to
his
great
regret
pencroft
was
obliged
to
suspend
his
boatbuilding
which
he
hoped
to
finish
in
time
for
next
spring
the
sailors
great
idea
was
to
make
a
voyage
of
discovery
to
tabor
island
although
harding
could
not
approve
of
a
voyage
simply
for
curiositys
sake
for
there
was
evidently
nothing
to
be
found
on
this
desert
and
almost
arid
rock
a
voyage
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
a
comparatively
small
vessel
over
unknown
seas
could
not
but
cause
him
some
anxiety
suppose
that
their
vessel
once
out
at
sea
should
be
unable
to
reach
tabor
island
and
could
not
return
to
lincoln
island
what
would
become
of
her
in
the
midst
of
the
pacific
so
fruitful
of
disasters
harding
often
talked
over
this
project
with
pencroft
and
he
found
him
strangely
bent
upon
undertaking
this
voyage
for
which
determination
he
himself
could
give
no
sufficient
reason
now
said
the
engineer
one
day
to
him
i
must
observe
my
friend
that
after
having
said
so
much
in
praise
of
lincoln
island
after
having
spoken
so
often
of
the
sorrow
you
would
feel
if
you
were
obliged
to
forsake
it
you
are
the
first
to
wish
to
leave
it
only
to
leave
it
for
a
few
days
replied
pencroft
only
for
a
few
days
captain
time
to
go
and
come
back
and
see
what
that
islet
is
like
but
it
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
lincoln
island
i
know
that
beforehand
then
why
venture
there
to
know
what
is
going
on
in
tabor
island
but
nothing
is
going
on
there
nothing
could
happen
there
who
knows
and
if
you
are
caught
in
a
hurricane
there
is
no
fear
of
that
in
the
fine
season
replied
pencroft
but
captain
as
we
must
provide
against
everything
i
shall
ask
your
permission
to
take
herbert
only
with
me
on
this
voyage
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
placing
his
hand
on
the
sailors
shoulder
if
any
misfortune
happens
to
you
or
to
this
lad
whom
chance
has
made
our
child
do
you
think
we
could
ever
cease
to
blame
ourselves
captain
harding
replied
pencroft
with
unshaken
confidence
we
shall
not
cause
you
that
sorrow
besides
we
will
speak
further
of
this
voyage
when
the
time
comes
to
make
it
and
i
fancy
when
you
have
seen
our
tightrigged
little
craft
when
you
have
observed
how
she
behaves
at
sea
when
we
sail
round
our
island
for
we
will
do
so
togetheri
fancy
i
say
that
you
will
no
longer
hesitate
to
let
me
go
i
dont
conceal
from
you
that
your
boat
will
be
a
masterpiece
say
our
boat
at
least
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
disarmed
for
the
moment
the
conversation
ended
thus
to
be
resumed
later
on
without
convincing
either
the
sailor
or
the
engineer
the
first
snow
fell
towards
the
end
of
the
month
of
june
the
corral
had
previously
been
largely
supplied
with
stores
so
that
daily
visits
to
it
were
not
requisite
but
it
was
decided
that
more
than
a
week
should
never
be
allowed
to
pass
without
someone
going
to
it
traps
were
again
set
and
the
machines
manufactured
by
harding
were
tried
the
bent
whalebones
imprisoned
in
a
case
of
ice
and
covered
with
a
thick
outer
layer
of
fat
were
placed
on
the
border
of
the
forest
at
a
spot
where
animals
usually
passed
on
their
way
to
the
lake
to
the
engineers
great
satisfaction
this
invention
copied
from
the
aleutian
fishermen
succeeded
perfectly
a
dozen
foxes
a
few
wild
boars
and
even
a
jaguar
were
taken
in
this
way
the
animals
being
found
dead
their
stomachs
pierced
by
the
unbent
bones
an
incident
must
here
be
related
not
only
as
interesting
in
itself
but
because
it
was
the
first
attempt
made
by
the
colonists
to
communicate
with
the
rest
of
mankind
gideon
spilett
had
already
several
times
pondered
whether
to
throw
into
the
sea
a
letter
enclosed
in
a
bottle
which
currents
might
perhaps
carry
to
an
inhabited
coast
or
to
confide
it
to
pigeons
but
how
could
it
be
seriously
hoped
that
either
pigeons
or
bottles
could
cross
the
distance
of
twelve
hundred
miles
which
separated
the
island
from
any
inhabited
land
it
would
have
been
pure
folly
but
on
the
30th
of
june
the
capture
was
effected
not
without
difficulty
of
an
albatross
which
a
shot
from
herberts
gun
had
slightly
wounded
in
the
foot
it
was
a
magnificent
bird
measuring
ten
feet
from
wing
to
wing
and
which
could
traverse
seas
as
wide
as
the
pacific
herbert
would
have
liked
to
keep
this
superb
bird
as
its
wound
would
soon
heal
and
he
thought
he
could
tame
it
but
spilett
explained
to
him
that
they
should
not
neglect
this
opportunity
of
attempting
to
communicate
by
this
messenger
with
the
lands
of
the
pacific
for
if
the
albatross
had
come
from
some
inhabited
region
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
it
would
return
there
so
soon
as
it
was
set
free
perhaps
in
his
heart
gideon
spilett
in
whom
the
journalist
sometimes
came
to
the
surface
was
not
sorry
to
have
the
opportunity
of
sending
forth
to
take
its
chance
an
exciting
article
relating
the
adventures
of
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
what
a
success
for
the
authorized
reporter
of
the
new
york
herald
and
for
the
number
which
should
contain
the
article
if
it
should
ever
reach
the
address
of
its
editor
the
honorable
james
bennett
gideon
spilett
then
wrote
out
a
concise
account
which
was
placed
in
a
strong
waterproof
bag
with
an
earnest
request
to
whoever
might
find
it
to
forward
it
to
the
office
of
the
new
york
herald
this
little
bag
was
fastened
to
the
neck
of
the
albatross
and
not
to
its
foot
for
these
birds
are
in
the
habit
of
resting
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
then
liberty
was
given
to
this
swift
courier
of
the
air
and
it
was
not
without
some
emotion
that
the
colonists
watched
it
disappear
in
the
misty
west
where
is
he
going
to
asked
pencroft
towards
new
zealand
replied
herbert
a
good
voyage
to
you
shouted
the
sailor
who
himself
did
not
expect
any
great
result
from
this
mode
of
correspondence
with
the
winter
work
had
been
resumed
in
the
interior
of
granite
house
mending
clothes
and
different
occupations
among
others
making
the
sails
for
their
vessel
which
were
cut
from
the
inexhaustible
ballooncase
during
the
month
of
july
the
cold
was
intense
but
there
was
no
lack
of
either
wood
or
coal
cyrus
harding
had
established
a
second
fireplace
in
the
diningroom
and
there
the
long
winter
evenings
were
spent
talking
while
they
worked
reading
when
the
hands
remained
idle
the
time
passed
with
profit
to
all
it
was
real
enjoyment
to
the
settlers
when
in
their
room
well
lighted
with
candles
well
warmed
with
coal
after
a
good
dinner
elderberry
coffee
smoking
in
the
cups
the
pipes
giving
forth
an
odoriferous
smoke
they
could
hear
the
storm
howling
without
their
comfort
would
have
been
complete
if
complete
comfort
could
ever
exist
for
those
who
are
far
from
their
fellowcreatures
and
without
any
means
of
communication
with
them
they
often
talked
of
their
country
of
the
friends
whom
they
had
left
of
the
grandeur
of
the
american
republic
whose
influence
could
not
but
increase
and
cyrus
harding
who
had
been
much
mixed
up
with
the
affairs
of
the
union
greatly
interested
his
auditors
by
his
recitals
his
views
and
his
prognostics
it
chanced
one
day
that
spilett
was
led
to
say
but
now
my
dear
cyrus
all
this
industrial
and
commercial
movement
to
which
you
predict
a
continual
advance
does
it
not
run
the
danger
of
being
sooner
or
later
completely
stopped
stopped
and
by
what
by
the
want
of
coal
which
may
justly
be
called
the
most
precious
of
minerals
yes
the
most
precious
indeed
replied
the
engineer
and
it
would
seem
that
nature
wished
to
prove
that
it
was
so
by
making
the
diamond
which
is
simply
pure
carbon
crystallized
you
dont
mean
to
say
captain
interrupted
pencroft
that
we
burn
diamonds
in
our
stoves
in
the
shape
of
coal
no
my
friend
replied
harding
however
resumed
gideon
spilett
you
do
not
deny
that
some
day
the
coal
will
be
entirely
consumed
oh
the
veins
of
coal
are
still
considerable
and
the
hundred
thousand
miners
who
annually
extract
from
them
a
hundred
millions
of
hundredweights
have
not
nearly
exhausted
them
with
the
increasing
consumption
of
coal
replied
gideon
spilett
it
can
be
foreseen
that
the
hundred
thousand
workmen
will
soon
become
two
hundred
thousand
and
that
the
rate
of
extraction
will
be
doubled
doubtless
but
after
the
european
mines
which
will
be
soon
worked
more
thoroughly
with
new
machines
the
american
and
australian
mines
will
for
a
long
time
yet
provide
for
the
consumption
in
trade
for
how
long
a
time
asked
the
reporter
for
at
least
two
hundred
and
fifty
or
three
hundred
years
that
is
reassuring
for
us
but
a
bad
lookout
for
our
greatgrandchildren
observed
pencroft
they
will
discover
something
else
said
herbert
it
is
to
be
hoped
so
answered
spilett
for
without
coal
there
would
be
no
machinery
and
without
machinery
there
would
be
no
railways
no
steamers
no
manufactories
nothing
of
that
which
is
indispensable
to
modern
civilization
but
what
will
they
find
asked
pencroft
can
you
guess
captain
nearly
my
friend
and
what
will
they
burn
instead
of
coal
water
replied
harding
water
cried
pencroft
water
as
fuel
for
steamers
and
engines
water
to
heat
water
yes
but
water
decomposed
into
its
primitive
elements
replied
cyrus
harding
and
decomposed
doubtless
by
electricity
which
will
then
have
become
a
powerful
and
manageable
force
for
all
great
discoveries
by
some
inexplicable
laws
appear
to
agree
and
become
complete
at
the
same
time
yes
my
friends
i
believe
that
water
will
one
day
be
employed
as
fuel
that
hydrogen
and
oxygen
which
constitute
it
used
singly
or
together
will
furnish
an
inexhaustible
source
of
heat
and
light
of
an
intensity
of
which
coal
is
not
capable
some
day
the
coalrooms
of
steamers
and
the
tenders
of
locomotives
will
instead
of
coal
be
stored
with
these
two
condensed
gases
which
will
burn
in
the
furnaces
with
enormous
calorific
power
there
is
therefore
nothing
to
fear
as
long
as
the
earth
is
inhabited
it
will
supply
the
wants
of
its
inhabitants
and
there
will
be
no
want
of
either
light
or
heat
as
long
as
the
productions
of
the
vegetable
mineral
or
animal
kingdoms
do
not
fail
us
i
believe
then
that
when
the
deposits
of
coal
are
exhausted
we
shall
heat
and
warm
ourselves
with
water
water
will
be
the
coal
of
the
future
i
should
like
to
see
that
observed
the
sailor
you
were
born
too
soon
pencroft
returned
neb
who
only
took
part
in
the
discussion
by
these
words
however
it
was
not
nebs
speech
which
interrupted
the
conversation
but
tops
barking
which
broke
out
again
with
that
strange
intonation
which
had
before
perplexed
the
engineer
at
the
same
time
top
began
to
run
round
the
mouth
of
the
well
which
opened
at
the
extremity
of
the
interior
passage
what
can
top
be
barking
in
that
way
for
asked
pencroft
and
jup
be
growling
like
that
added
herbert
in
fact
the
orang
joining
the
dog
gave
unequivocal
signs
of
agitation
and
singular
to
say
the
two
animals
appeared
more
uneasy
than
angry
it
is
evident
said
gideon
spilett
that
this
well
is
in
direct
communication
with
the
sea
and
that
some
marine
animal
comes
from
time
to
time
to
breathe
at
the
bottom
thats
evident
replied
the
sailor
and
there
can
be
no
other
explanation
to
give
quiet
there
top
added
pencroft
turning
to
the
dog
and
you
jup
be
off
to
your
room
the
ape
and
the
dog
were
silent
jup
went
off
to
bed
but
top
remained
in
the
room
and
continued
to
utter
low
growls
at
intervals
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
there
was
no
further
talk
on
the
subject
but
the
incident
however
clouded
the
brow
of
the
engineer
during
the
remainder
of
the
month
of
july
there
was
alternate
rain
and
frost
the
temperature
was
not
so
low
as
during
the
preceding
winter
and
its
maximum
did
not
exceed
eight
degrees
fahrenheit
but
although
this
winter
was
less
cold
it
was
more
troubled
by
storms
and
squalls
the
sea
besides
often
endangered
the
safety
of
the
chimneys
at
times
it
almost
seemed
as
if
an
undercurrent
raised
these
monstrous
billows
which
thundered
against
the
wall
of
granite
house
when
the
settlers
leaning
from
their
windows
gazed
on
the
huge
watery
masses
breaking
beneath
their
eyes
they
could
not
but
admire
the
magnificent
spectacle
of
the
ocean
in
its
impotent
fury
the
waves
rebounded
in
dazzling
foam
the
beach
entirely
disapppearing
under
the
raging
flood
and
the
cliff
appearing
to
emerge
from
the
sea
itself
the
spray
rising
to
a
height
of
more
than
a
hundred
feet
during
these
storms
it
was
difficult
and
even
dangerous
to
venture
out
owing
to
the
frequently
falling
trees
however
the
colonists
never
allowed
a
week
to
pass
without
having
paid
a
visit
to
the
corral
happily
this
enclosure
sheltered
by
the
southeastern
spur
of
mount
franklin
did
not
greatly
suffer
from
the
violence
of
the
hurricanes
which
spared
its
trees
sheds
and
palisades
but
the
poultryyard
on
prospect
heights
being
directly
exposed
to
the
gusts
of
wind
from
the
east
suffered
considerable
damage
the
pigeonhouse
was
twice
unroofed
and
the
paling
blown
down
all
this
required
to
be
remade
more
solidly
than
before
for
as
may
be
clearly
seen
lincoln
island
was
situated
in
one
of
the
most
dangerous
parts
of
the
pacific
it
really
appeared
as
if
it
formed
the
central
point
of
vast
cyclones
which
beat
it
perpetually
as
the
whip
does
the
top
only
here
it
was
the
top
which
was
motionless
and
the
whip
which
moved
during
the
first
week
of
the
month
of
august
the
weather
became
more
moderate
and
the
atmosphere
recovered
the
calm
which
it
appeared
to
have
lost
forever
with
the
calm
the
cold
again
became
intense
and
the
thermometer
fell
to
eight
degrees
fahrenheit
below
zero
on
the
3rd
of
august
an
excursion
which
had
been
talked
of
for
several
days
was
made
into
the
southeastern
part
of
the
island
towards
tadorn
marsh
the
hunters
were
tempted
by
the
aquatic
game
which
took
up
their
winter
quarters
there
wild
duck
snipe
teal
and
grebe
abounded
there
and
it
was
agreed
that
a
day
should
be
devoted
to
an
expedition
against
these
birds
not
only
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
but
pencroft
and
neb
also
took
part
in
this
excursion
cyrus
harding
alone
alleging
some
work
as
an
excuse
did
not
join
them
but
remained
at
granite
house
the
hunters
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
port
balloon
in
order
to
reach
the
marsh
after
having
promised
to
be
back
by
the
evening
top
and
jup
accompanied
them
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
over
the
mercy
bridge
the
engineer
raised
it
and
returned
intending
to
put
into
execution
a
project
for
the
performance
of
which
he
wished
to
be
alone
now
this
project
was
to
minutely
explore
the
interior
well
the
mouth
of
which
was
on
a
level
with
the
passage
of
granite
house
and
which
communicated
with
the
sea
since
it
formerly
supplied
a
way
to
the
waters
of
the
lake
why
did
top
so
often
run
round
this
opening
why
did
he
utter
such
strange
barks
when
a
sort
of
uneasiness
seemed
to
draw
him
towards
this
well
why
did
jup
join
top
in
a
sort
of
common
anxiety
had
this
well
branches
besides
the
communication
with
the
sea
did
it
spread
towards
other
parts
of
the
island
this
is
what
cyrus
harding
wished
to
know
he
had
resolved
therefore
to
attempt
the
exploration
of
the
well
during
the
absence
of
his
companions
and
an
opportunity
for
doing
so
had
now
presented
itself
it
was
easy
to
descend
to
the
bottom
of
the
well
by
employing
the
rope
ladder
which
had
not
been
used
since
the
establishment
of
the
lift
the
engineer
drew
the
ladder
to
the
hole
the
diameter
of
which
measured
nearly
six
feet
and
allowed
it
to
unroll
itself
after
having
securely
fastened
its
upper
extremity
then
having
lighted
a
lantern
taken
a
revolver
and
placed
a
cutlass
in
his
belt
he
began
the
descent
the
sides
were
everywhere
entire
but
points
of
rock
jutted
out
here
and
there
and
by
means
of
these
points
it
would
have
been
quite
possible
for
an
active
creature
to
climb
to
the
mouth
of
the
well
the
engineer
remarked
this
but
although
he
carefully
examined
these
points
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
he
could
find
no
impression
no
fracture
which
could
give
any
reason
to
suppose
that
they
had
either
recently
or
at
any
former
time
been
used
as
a
staircase
cyrus
harding
descended
deeper
throwing
the
light
of
his
lantern
on
all
sides
he
saw
nothing
suspicious
when
the
engineer
had
reached
the
last
rounds
he
came
upon
the
water
which
was
then
perfectly
calm
neither
at
its
level
nor
in
any
other
part
of
the
well
did
any
passage
open
which
could
lead
to
the
interior
of
the
cliff
the
wall
which
harding
struck
with
the
hilt
of
his
cutlass
sounded
solid
it
was
compact
granite
through
which
no
living
being
could
force
a
way
to
arrive
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
and
then
climb
up
to
its
mouth
it
was
necessary
to
pass
through
the
channel
under
the
rocky
subsoil
of
the
beach
which
placed
it
in
communication
with
the
sea
and
this
was
only
possible
for
marine
animals
as
to
the
question
of
knowing
where
this
channel
ended
at
what
point
of
the
shore
and
at
what
depth
beneath
the
water
it
could
not
be
answered
then
cyrus
harding
having
ended
his
survey
reascended
drew
up
the
ladder
covered
the
mouth
of
the
well
and
returned
thoughtfully
to
the
diningroom
saying
to
himself
i
have
seen
nothing
and
yet
there
is
something
there
chapter
12
in
the
evening
the
hunters
returned
having
enjoyed
good
sport
and
being
literally
loaded
with
game
indeed
they
had
as
much
as
four
men
could
possibly
carry
top
wore
a
necklace
of
teal
and
jup
wreaths
of
snipe
round
his
body
here
master
cried
neb
heres
something
to
employ
our
time
preserved
and
made
into
pies
we
shall
have
a
welcome
store
but
i
must
have
some
one
to
help
me
i
count
on
you
pencroft
no
neb
replied
the
sailor
i
have
the
rigging
of
the
vessel
to
finish
and
to
look
after
and
you
will
have
to
do
without
me
and
you
mr
herbert
i
must
go
to
the
corral
tomorrow
neb
replied
the
lad
it
will
be
you
then
mr
spilett
who
will
help
me
to
oblige
you
neb
i
will
replied
the
reporter
but
i
warn
you
that
if
you
disclose
your
recipes
to
me
i
shall
publish
them
whenever
you
like
mr
spilett
replied
neb
whenever
you
like
and
so
the
next
day
gideon
spilett
became
nebs
assistant
and
was
installed
in
his
culinary
laboratory
the
engineer
had
previously
made
known
to
him
the
result
of
the
exploration
which
he
had
made
the
day
before
and
on
this
point
the
reporter
shared
hardings
opinion
that
although
he
had
found
nothing
a
secret
still
remained
to
be
discovered
the
frost
continued
for
another
week
and
the
settlers
did
not
leave
granite
house
unless
to
look
after
the
poultryyard
the
dwelling
was
filled
with
appetizing
odors
which
were
emitted
from
the
learned
manipulation
of
neb
and
the
reporter
but
all
the
results
of
the
chase
were
not
made
into
preserved
provisions
and
as
the
game
kept
perfectly
in
the
intense
cold
wild
duck
and
other
fowl
were
eaten
fresh
and
declared
superior
to
all
other
aquatic
birds
in
the
known
world
during
this
week
pencroft
aided
by
herbert
who
handled
the
sailmakers
needle
with
much
skill
worked
with
such
energy
that
the
sails
of
the
vessel
were
finished
there
was
no
want
of
cordage
thanks
to
the
rigging
which
had
been
discovered
with
the
case
of
the
balloon
the
ropes
and
cables
from
the
net
were
all
of
good
quality
and
the
sailor
turned
them
all
to
account
to
the
sails
were
attached
strong
bolt
ropes
and
there
still
remained
enough
from
which
to
make
the
halyards
shrouds
and
sheets
etc
the
blocks
were
manufactured
by
cyrus
harding
under
pencrofts
directions
by
means
of
the
turning
lathe
it
therefore
happened
that
the
rigging
was
entirely
prepared
before
the
vessel
was
finished
pencroft
also
manufactured
a
flag
that
flag
so
dear
to
every
true
american
containing
the
stars
and
stripes
of
their
glorious
union
the
colors
for
it
were
supplied
from
certain
plants
used
in
dyeing
and
which
were
very
abundant
in
the
island
only
to
the
thirtyseven
stars
representing
the
thirtyseven
states
of
the
union
which
shine
on
the
american
flag
the
sailor
added
a
thirtyeighth
the
star
of
the
state
of
lincoln
for
he
considered
his
island
as
already
united
to
the
great
republic
and
said
he
it
is
so
already
in
heart
if
not
in
deed
in
the
meantime
the
flag
was
hoisted
at
the
central
window
of
granite
house
and
the
settlers
saluted
it
with
three
cheers
the
cold
season
was
now
almost
at
an
end
and
it
appeared
as
if
this
second
winter
was
to
pass
without
any
unusual
occurrence
when
on
the
night
of
the
11th
of
august
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
was
menaced
with
complete
destruction
after
a
busy
day
the
colonists
were
sleeping
soundly
when
towards
four
oclock
in
the
morning
they
were
suddenly
awakened
by
tops
barking
the
dog
was
not
this
time
barking
near
the
mouth
of
the
well
but
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
at
which
he
was
scratching
as
if
he
wished
to
burst
it
open
jup
was
also
uttering
piercing
cries
hello
top
cried
neb
who
was
the
first
awake
but
the
dog
continued
to
bark
more
furiously
than
ever
whats
the
matter
now
asked
harding
and
all
dressing
in
haste
rushed
to
the
windows
which
they
opened
beneath
their
eyes
was
spread
a
sheet
of
snow
which
looked
gray
in
the
dim
light
the
settlers
could
see
nothing
but
they
heard
a
singular
yelping
noise
away
in
the
darkness
it
was
evident
that
the
beach
had
been
invaded
by
a
number
of
animals
which
could
not
be
seen
what
are
they
cried
pencroft
wolves
jaguars
or
apes
replied
neb
they
have
nearly
reached
the
plateau
said
the
reporter
and
our
poultryyard
exclaimed
herbert
and
our
garden
where
can
they
have
crossed
asked
pencroft
they
must
have
crossed
the
bridge
on
the
shore
replied
the
engineer
which
one
of
us
must
have
forgotten
to
close
true
said
spilett
i
remember
having
left
it
open
a
fine
job
you
have
made
of
it
mr
spilett
cried
the
sailor
what
is
done
cannot
be
undone
replied
cyrus
harding
we
must
consult
what
it
will
now
be
best
to
do
such
were
the
questions
and
answers
which
were
rapidly
exchanged
between
harding
and
his
companions
it
was
certain
that
the
bridge
had
been
crossed
that
the
shore
had
been
invaded
by
animals
and
that
whatever
they
might
be
they
could
by
ascending
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
reach
prospect
heights
they
must
therefore
be
advanced
against
quickly
and
fought
with
if
necessary
but
what
are
these
beasts
was
asked
a
second
time
as
the
yelpings
were
again
heard
more
loudly
than
before
these
yelps
made
herbert
start
and
he
remembered
having
heard
them
before
during
his
first
visit
to
the
sources
of
the
red
creek
they
are
colpeo
foxes
he
exclaimed
forward
shouted
the
sailor
and
all
arming
themselves
with
hatchets
carbines
and
revolvers
threw
themselves
into
the
lift
and
soon
set
foot
on
the
shore
colpeos
are
dangerous
animals
when
in
great
numbers
and
irritated
by
hunger
nevertheless
the
colonists
did
not
hesitate
to
throw
themselves
into
the
midst
of
the
troop
and
their
first
shots
vividly
lighting
up
the
darkness
made
their
assailants
draw
back
the
chief
thing
was
to
hinder
these
plunderers
from
reaching
the
plateau
for
the
garden
and
the
poultryyard
would
then
have
been
at
their
mercy
and
immense
perhaps
irreparable
mischief
would
inevitably
be
the
result
especially
with
regard
to
the
cornfield
but
as
the
invasion
of
the
plateau
could
only
be
made
by
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
it
was
sufficient
to
oppose
the
colpeos
on
the
narrow
bank
between
the
river
and
the
cliff
of
granite
this
was
plain
to
all
and
by
cyrus
hardings
orders
they
reached
the
spot
indicated
by
him
while
the
colpeos
rushed
fiercely
through
the
gloom
harding
gideon
spilett
herbert
pencroft
and
neb
posted
themselves
in
impregnable
line
top
his
formidable
jaws
open
preceded
the
colonists
and
he
was
followed
by
jup
armed
with
a
knotty
cudgel
which
he
brandished
like
a
club
the
night
was
extremely
dark
it
was
only
by
the
flashes
from
the
revolvers
as
each
person
fired
that
they
could
see
their
assailants
who
were
at
least
a
hundred
in
number
and
whose
eyes
were
glowing
like
hot
coals
they
must
not
pass
shouted
pencroft
they
shall
not
pass
returned
the
engineer
but
if
they
did
not
pass
it
was
not
for
want
of
having
attempted
it
those
in
the
rear
pushed
on
the
foremost
assailants
and
it
was
an
incessant
struggle
with
revolvers
and
hatchets
several
colpeos
already
lay
dead
on
the
ground
but
their
number
did
not
appear
to
diminish
and
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
reinforcements
were
continually
arriving
over
the
bridge
the
colonists
were
soon
obliged
to
fight
at
close
quarters
not
without
receiving
some
wounds
though
happily
very
slight
ones
herbert
had
with
a
shot
from
his
revolver
rescued
neb
on
whose
back
a
colpeo
had
sprung
like
a
tiger
cat
top
fought
with
actual
fury
flying
at
the
throats
of
the
foxes
and
strangling
them
instantaneously
jup
wielded
his
weapon
valiantly
and
it
was
in
vain
that
they
endeavored
to
keep
him
in
the
rear
endowed
doubtless
with
sight
which
enabled
him
to
pierce
the
obscurity
he
was
always
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
uttering
from
time
to
timea
sharp
hissing
sound
which
was
with
him
the
sign
of
great
rejoicing
at
one
moment
he
advanced
so
far
that
by
the
light
from
a
revolver
he
was
seen
surrounded
by
five
or
six
large
colpeos
with
whom
he
was
coping
with
great
coolness
however
the
struggle
was
ended
at
last
and
victory
was
on
the
side
of
the
settlers
but
not
until
they
had
fought
for
two
long
hours
the
first
signs
of
the
approach
of
day
doubtless
determined
the
retreat
of
their
assailants
who
scampered
away
towards
the
north
passing
over
the
bridge
which
neb
ran
immediately
to
raise
when
day
had
sufficiently
lighted
up
the
field
of
battle
the
settlers
counted
as
many
as
fifty
dead
bodies
scattered
about
on
the
shore
and
jup
cried
pencroft
where
is
jup
jup
had
disappeared
his
friend
neb
called
him
and
for
the
first
time
jup
did
not
reply
to
his
friends
call
everyone
set
out
in
search
of
jup
trembling
lest
he
should
be
found
among
the
slain
they
cleared
the
place
of
the
bodies
which
stained
the
snow
with
their
blood
jup
was
found
in
the
midst
of
a
heap
of
colpeos
whose
broken
jaws
and
crushed
bodies
showed
that
they
had
to
do
with
the
terrible
club
of
the
intrepid
animal
poor
jup
still
held
in
his
hand
the
stump
of
his
broken
cudgel
but
deprived
of
his
weapon
he
had
been
overpowered
by
numbers
and
his
chest
was
covered
with
severe
wounds
he
is
living
cried
neb
who
was
bending
over
him
and
we
will
save
him
replied
the
sailor
we
will
nurse
him
as
if
he
was
one
of
ourselves
it
appeared
as
if
jup
understood
for
he
leaned
his
head
on
pencrofts
shoulder
as
if
to
thank
him
the
sailor
was
wounded
himself
but
his
wound
was
insignificant
as
were
those
of
his
companions
for
thanks
to
their
firearms
they
had
been
almost
always
able
to
keep
their
assailants
at
a
distance
it
was
therefore
only
the
orang
whose
condition
was
serious
jup
carried
by
neb
and
pencroft
was
placed
in
the
lift
and
only
a
slight
moan
now
and
then
escaped
his
lips
he
was
gently
drawn
up
to
granite
house
there
he
was
laid
on
a
mattress
taken
from
one
of
the
beds
and
his
wounds
were
bathed
with
the
greatest
care
it
did
not
appear
that
any
vital
part
had
been
reached
but
jup
was
very
weak
from
loss
of
blood
and
a
high
fever
soon
set
in
after
his
wounds
had
been
dressed
he
was
laid
down
strict
diet
was
imposed
just
like
a
real
person
as
neb
said
and
they
made
him
swallow
several
cups
of
a
cooling
drink
for
which
the
ingredients
were
supplied
from
the
vegetable
medicine
chest
of
granite
house
jup
was
at
first
restless
but
his
breathing
gradually
became
more
regular
and
he
was
left
sleeping
quietly
from
time
to
time
top
walking
on
tiptoe
as
one
might
say
came
to
visit
his
friend
and
seemed
to
approve
of
all
the
care
that
had
been
taken
of
him
one
of
jups
hands
hung
over
the
side
of
his
bed
and
top
licked
it
with
a
sympathizing
air
they
employed
the
day
in
interring
the
dead
who
were
dragged
to
the
forest
of
the
far
west
and
there
buried
deep
this
attack
which
might
have
had
such
serious
consequences
was
a
lesson
to
the
settlers
who
from
this
time
never
went
to
bed
until
one
of
their
number
had
made
sure
that
all
the
bridges
were
raised
and
that
no
invasion
was
possible
however
jup
after
having
given
them
serious
anxiety
for
several
days
began
to
recover
his
constitution
brought
him
through
the
fever
gradually
subsided
and
gideon
spilett
who
was
a
bit
of
a
doctor
pronounced
him
quite
out
of
danger
on
the
16th
of
august
jup
began
to
eat
neb
made
him
nice
little
sweet
dishes
which
the
invalid
devoured
with
great
relish
for
if
he
had
a
pet
failing
it
was
that
of
being
somewhat
of
a
gourmand
and
neb
had
never
done
anything
to
cure
him
of
this
fault
what
would
you
have
said
he
to
gideon
spilett
who
sometimes
expostulated
with
him
for
spoiling
the
ape
poor
jup
has
no
other
pleasure
than
that
of
the
palate
and
i
am
only
too
glad
to
be
able
to
reward
his
services
in
this
way
ten
days
after
taking
to
his
bed
on
the
21st
of
august
master
jup
arose
his
wounds
were
healed
and
it
was
evident
that
he
would
not
be
long
in
regaining
his
usual
strength
and
agility
like
all
convalescents
he
was
tremendously
hungry
and
the
reporter
allowed
him
to
eat
as
much
as
he
liked
for
he
trusted
to
that
instinct
which
is
too
often
wanting
in
reasoning
beings
to
keep
the
orang
from
any
excess
neb
was
delighted
to
see
his
pupils
appetite
returning
eat
away
my
jup
said
he
and
dont
spare
anything
you
have
shed
your
blood
for
us
and
it
is
the
least
i
can
do
to
make
you
strong
again
on
the
25th
of
august
nebs
voice
was
heard
calling
to
his
companions
captain
mr
spilett
mr
herbert
pencroft
come
come
the
colonists
who
were
together
in
the
diningroom
rose
at
nebs
call
who
was
then
in
jups
room
whats
the
matter
asked
the
reporter
look
replied
neb
with
a
shout
of
laughter
and
what
did
they
see
master
jup
smoking
calmly
and
seriously
sitting
crosslegged
like
a
turk
at
the
entrance
to
granite
house
my
pipe
cried
pencroft
he
has
taken
my
pipe
hello
my
honest
jup
i
make
you
a
present
of
it
smoke
away
old
boy
smoke
away
and
jup
gravely
puffed
out
clouds
of
smoke
which
seemed
to
give
him
great
satisfaction
harding
did
not
appear
to
be
much
astonished
at
this
incident
and
he
cited
several
examples
of
tame
apes
to
whom
the
use
of
tobacco
had
become
quite
familiar
but
from
this
day
master
jup
had
a
pipe
of
his
own
the
sailors
expipe
which
was
hung
in
his
room
near
his
store
of
tobacco
he
filled
it
himself
lighted
it
with
a
glowing
coal
and
appeared
to
be
the
happiest
of
quadrumana
it
may
readily
be
understood
that
this
similarity
of
tastes
of
jup
and
pencroft
served
to
tighten
the
bonds
of
friendship
which
already
existed
between
the
honest
ape
and
the
worthy
sailor
perhaps
he
is
really
a
man
said
pencroft
sometimes
to
neb
should
you
be
surprised
to
hear
him
beginning
to
speak
to
us
some
day
my
word
no
replied
neb
what
astonishes
me
is
that
he
hasnt
spoken
to
us
before
for
now
he
wants
nothing
but
speech
it
would
amuse
me
all
the
same
resumed
the
sailor
if
some
fine
day
he
said
to
me
suppose
we
change
pipes
pencroft
yes
replied
neb
what
a
pity
he
was
born
dumb
with
the
month
of
september
the
winter
ended
and
the
works
were
again
eagerly
commenced
the
building
of
the
vessel
advanced
rapidly
she
was
already
completely
decked
over
and
all
the
inside
parts
of
the
hull
were
firmly
united
with
ribs
bent
by
means
of
steam
which
answered
all
the
purposes
of
a
mold
as
there
was
no
want
of
wood
pencroft
proposed
to
the
engineer
to
give
a
double
lining
to
the
hull
to
insure
the
strength
of
the
vessel
harding
not
knowing
what
the
future
might
have
in
store
for
them
approved
the
sailors
idea
of
making
the
craft
as
strong
as
possible
the
interior
and
deck
of
the
vessel
was
entirely
finished
towards
the
15th
of
september
for
calking
the
seams
they
made
oakum
of
dry
seaweed
which
was
hammered
in
between
the
planks
then
these
seams
were
covered
with
boiling
tar
which
was
obtained
in
great
abundance
from
the
pines
in
the
forest
the
management
of
the
vessel
was
very
simple
she
had
from
the
first
been
ballasted
with
heavy
blocks
of
granite
walled
up
in
a
bed
of
lime
twelve
thousand
pounds
of
which
they
stowed
away
a
deck
was
placed
over
this
ballast
and
the
interior
was
divided
into
two
cabins
two
benches
extended
along
them
and
served
also
as
lockers
the
foot
of
the
mast
supported
the
partition
which
separated
the
two
cabins
which
were
reached
by
two
hatchways
let
into
the
deck
pencroft
had
no
trouble
in
finding
a
tree
suitable
for
the
mast
he
chose
a
straight
young
fir
with
no
knots
and
which
he
had
only
to
square
at
the
step
and
round
off
at
the
top
the
ironwork
of
the
mast
the
rudder
and
the
hull
had
been
roughly
but
strongly
forged
at
the
chimneys
lastly
yards
masts
boom
spars
oars
etc
were
all
furnished
by
the
first
week
in
october
and
it
was
agreed
that
a
trial
trip
should
be
taken
round
the
island
so
as
to
ascertain
how
the
vessel
would
behave
at
sea
and
how
far
they
might
depend
upon
her
during
all
this
time
the
necessary
works
had
not
been
neglected
the
corral
was
enlarged
for
the
flock
of
musmons
and
goats
had
been
increased
by
a
number
of
young
ones
who
had
to
be
housed
and
fed
the
colonists
had
paid
visits
also
to
the
oyster
bed
the
warren
the
coal
and
iron
mines
and
to
the
till
then
unexplored
districts
of
the
far
west
forest
which
abounded
in
game
certain
indigenous
plants
were
discovered
and
those
fit
for
immediate
use
contributed
to
vary
the
vegetable
stores
of
granite
house
they
were
a
species
of
ficoide
some
similar
to
those
of
the
cape
with
eatable
fleshy
leaves
others
bearing
seeds
containing
a
sort
of
flour
on
the
10th
of
october
the
vessel
was
launched
pencroft
was
radiant
with
joy
the
operation
was
perfectly
successful
the
boat
completely
rigged
having
been
pushed
on
rollers
to
the
waters
edge
was
floated
by
the
rising
tide
amid
the
cheers
of
the
colonists
particularly
of
pencroft
who
showed
no
modesty
on
this
occasion
besides
his
importance
was
to
last
beyond
the
finishing
of
the
vessel
since
after
having
built
her
he
was
to
command
her
the
grade
of
captain
was
bestowed
upon
him
with
the
approbation
of
all
to
satisfy
captain
pencroft
it
was
now
necessary
to
give
a
name
to
the
vessel
and
after
many
propositions
had
been
discussed
the
votes
were
all
in
favor
of
the
bonadventure
as
soon
as
the
bonadventure
had
been
lifted
by
the
rising
tide
it
was
seen
that
she
lay
evenly
in
the
water
and
would
be
easily
navigated
however
the
trial
trip
was
to
be
made
that
very
day
by
an
excursion
off
the
coast
the
weather
was
fine
the
breeze
fresh
and
the
sea
smooth
especially
towards
the
south
coast
for
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
northwest
all
hands
on
board
shouted
pencroft
but
breakfast
was
first
necessary
and
it
was
thought
best
to
take
provisions
on
board
in
the
event
of
their
excursion
being
prolonged
until
the
evening
cyrus
harding
was
equally
anxious
to
try
the
vessel
the
model
of
which
had
originated
with
him
although
on
the
sailors
advice
he
had
altered
some
parts
of
it
but
he
did
not
share
pencrofts
confidence
in
her
and
as
the
latter
had
not
again
spoken
of
the
voyage
to
tabor
island
harding
hoped
he
had
given
it
up
he
would
have
indeed
great
reluctance
in
letting
two
or
three
of
his
companions
venture
so
far
in
so
small
a
boat
which
was
not
of
more
than
fifteen
tons
burden
at
halfpast
ten
everybody
was
on
board
even
top
and
jup
and
herbert
weighed
the
anchor
which
was
fast
in
the
sand
near
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
the
sail
was
hoisted
the
lincolnian
flag
floated
from
the
masthead
and
the
bonadventure
steered
by
pencroft
stood
out
to
sea
the
wind
blowing
out
of
union
bay
she
ran
before
it
and
thus
showed
her
owners
much
to
their
satisfaction
that
she
possessed
a
remarkably
fast
pair
of
heels
according
to
pencrofts
mode
of
speaking
after
having
doubled
flotsam
point
and
claw
cape
the
captain
kept
her
close
hauled
so
as
to
sail
along
the
southern
coast
of
the
island
when
it
was
found
she
sailed
admirably
within
five
points
of
the
wind
all
hands
were
enchanted
they
had
a
good
vessel
which
in
case
of
need
would
be
of
great
service
to
them
and
with
fine
weather
and
a
fresh
breeze
the
voyage
promised
to
be
charming
pencroft
now
stood
off
the
shore
three
or
four
miles
across
from
port
balloon
the
island
then
appeared
in
all
its
extent
and
under
a
new
aspect
with
the
varied
panorama
of
its
shore
from
claw
cape
to
reptile
end
the
forests
in
which
dark
firs
contrasted
with
the
young
foliage
of
other
trees
and
overlooked
the
whole
and
mount
franklin
whose
lofty
head
was
still
whitened
with
snow
how
beautiful
it
is
cried
herbert
yes
our
island
is
beautiful
and
good
replied
pencroft
i
love
it
as
i
loved
my
poor
mother
it
received
us
poor
and
destitute
and
now
what
is
wanting
to
us
five
fellows
who
fell
on
it
from
the
sky
nothing
replied
neb
nothing
captain
and
the
two
brave
men
gave
three
tremendous
cheers
in
honor
of
their
island
during
all
this
time
gideon
spilett
leaning
against
the
mast
sketched
the
panorama
which
was
developed
before
his
eyes
cyrus
harding
gazed
on
it
in
silence
well
captain
harding
asked
pencroft
what
do
you
think
of
our
vessel
she
appears
to
behave
well
replied
the
engineer
good
and
do
you
think
now
that
she
could
undertake
a
voyage
of
some
extent
what
voyage
pencroft
one
to
tabor
island
for
instance
my
friend
replied
harding
i
think
that
in
any
pressing
emergency
we
need
not
hesitate
to
trust
ourselves
to
the
bonadventure
even
for
a
longer
voyage
but
you
know
i
should
see
you
set
off
to
tabor
island
with
great
uneasiness
since
nothing
obliges
you
to
go
there
one
likes
to
know
ones
neighbors
returned
the
sailor
who
was
obstinate
in
his
idea
tabor
island
is
our
neighbor
and
the
only
one
politeness
requires
us
to
go
at
least
to
pay
a
visit
by
jove
said
spilett
our
friend
pencroft
has
become
very
particular
about
the
proprieties
all
at
once
i
am
not
particular
about
anything
at
all
retorted
the
sailor
who
was
rather
vexed
by
the
engineers
opposition
but
who
did
not
wish
to
cause
him
anxiety
consider
pencroft
resumed
harding
you
cannot
go
alone
to
tabor
island
one
companion
will
be
enough
for
me
even
so
replied
the
engineer
you
will
risk
depriving
the
colony
of
lincoln
island
of
two
settlers
out
of
five
out
of
six
answered
pencroft
you
forget
jup
out
of
seven
added
neb
top
is
quite
worth
another
there
is
no
risk
at
all
in
it
captain
replied
pencroft
that
is
possible
pencroft
but
i
repeat
it
is
to
expose
ourselves
uselessly
the
obstinate
sailor
did
not
reply
and
let
the
conversation
drop
quite
determined
to
resume
it
again
but
he
did
not
suspect
that
an
incident
would
come
to
his
aid
and
change
into
an
act
of
humanity
that
which
was
at
first
only
a
doubtful
whim
after
standing
off
the
shore
the
bonadventure
again
approached
it
in
the
direction
of
port
balloon
it
was
important
to
ascertain
the
channels
between
the
sandbanks
and
reefs
that
buoys
might
be
laid
down
since
this
little
creek
was
to
be
the
harbor
they
were
not
more
than
half
a
mile
from
the
coast
and
it
was
necessary
to
tack
to
beat
against
the
wind
the
bonadventure
was
then
going
at
a
very
moderate
rate
as
the
breeze
partly
intercepted
by
the
high
land
scarcely
swelled
her
sails
and
the
sea
smooth
as
glass
was
only
rippled
now
and
then
by
passing
gusts
herbert
had
stationed
himself
in
the
bows
that
he
might
indicate
the
course
to
be
followed
among
the
channels
when
all
at
once
he
shouted
luff
pencroft
luff
whats
the
matter
replied
the
sailor
a
rock
nowait
said
herbert
i
dont
quite
see
luff
againrightnow
so
saying
herbert
leaning
over
the
side
plunged
his
arm
into
the
water
and
pulled
it
out
exclaiming
a
bottle
he
held
in
his
hand
a
corked
bottle
which
he
had
just
seized
a
few
cables
length
from
the
shore
cyrus
harding
took
the
bottle
without
uttering
a
single
word
he
drew
the
cork
and
took
from
it
a
damp
paper
on
which
were
written
these
words

a
castaway
exclaimed
pencroft
left
on
this
tabor
island
not
two
hundred
miles
from
us
ah
captain
harding
you
wont
now
oppose
my
going
no
pencroft
replied
cyrus
harding
and
you
shall
set
out
as
soon
as
possible
tomorrow
tomorrow
the
engineer
still
held
in
his
hand
the
paper
which
he
had
taken
from
the
bottle
he
contemplated
it
for
some
instants
then
resumed
from
this
document
my
friends
from
the
way
in
which
it
is
worded
we
may
conclude
this
first
that
the
castaway
on
tabor
island
is
a
man
possessing
a
considerable
knowledge
of
navigation
since
he
gives
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
the
island
exactly
as
we
ourselves
found
it
and
to
a
second
of
approximation
secondly
that
he
is
either
english
or
american
as
the
document
is
written
in
the
english
language
that
is
perfectly
logical
answered
spilett
and
the
presence
of
this
castaway
explains
the
arrival
of
the
case
on
the
shores
of
our
island
there
must
have
been
a
wreck
since
there
is
a
castaway
as
to
the
latter
whoever
he
may
be
it
is
lucky
for
him
that
pencroft
thought
of
building
this
boat
and
of
trying
her
this
very
day
for
a
day
later
and
this
bottle
might
have
been
broken
on
the
rocks
indeed
said
herbert
it
is
a
fortunate
chance
that
the
bonadventure
passed
exactly
where
the
bottle
was
still
floating
does
not
this
appear
strange
to
you
asked
harding
of
pencroft
it
appears
fortunate
thats
all
answered
the
sailor
do
you
see
anything
extraordinary
in
it
captain
the
bottle
must
go
somewhere
and
why
not
here
as
well
as
anywhere
else
perhaps
you
are
right
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
and
yet
but
observed
herbert
theres
nothing
to
prove
that
this
bottle
has
been
floating
long
in
the
sea
nothing
replied
gideon
spilett
and
the
document
appears
even
to
have
been
recently
written
what
do
you
think
about
it
cyrus
during
this
conversation
pencroft
had
not
remained
inactive
he
had
put
the
vessel
about
and
the
bonadventure
all
sails
set
was
running
rapidly
towards
claw
cape
every
one
was
thinking
of
the
castaway
on
tabor
island
should
they
be
in
time
to
save
him
this
was
a
great
event
in
the
life
of
the
colonists
they
themselves
were
but
castaways
but
it
was
to
be
feared
that
another
might
not
have
been
so
fortunate
and
their
duty
was
to
go
to
his
succor
claw
cape
was
doubled
and
about
four
oclock
the
bonadventure
dropped
her
anchor
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
that
same
evening
the
arrangements
for
the
new
expedition
were
made
it
appeared
best
that
pencroft
and
herbert
who
knew
how
to
work
the
vessel
should
undertake
the
voyage
alone
by
setting
out
the
next
day
the
10th
of
october
they
would
arrive
on
the
13th
for
with
the
present
wind
it
would
not
take
more
than
fortyeight
hours
to
make
this
passage
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
one
day
in
the
island
three
or
four
to
return
they
might
hope
therefore
that
on
the
17th
they
would
again
reach
lincoln
island
the
weather
was
fine
the
barometer
was
rising
the
wind
appeared
settled
everything
then
was
in
favor
of
these
brave
men
whom
an
act
of
humanity
was
taking
far
from
their
island
thus
it
had
been
agreed
that
cyrus
harding
neb
and
gideon
spilett
should
remain
at
granite
house
but
an
objection
was
raised
and
spilett
who
had
not
forgotten
his
business
as
reporter
to
the
new
york
herald
having
declared
that
he
would
go
by
swimming
rather
than
lose
such
an
opportunity
he
was
admitted
to
take
a
part
in
the
voyage
the
evening
was
occupied
in
transporting
on
board
the
bonadventure
articles
of
bedding
utensils
arms
ammunition
a
compass
provisions
for
a
week
this
being
rapidly
done
the
colonists
ascended
to
granite
house
the
next
day
at
five
oclock
in
the
morning
the
farewells
were
said
not
without
some
emotion
on
both
sides
and
pencroft
setting
sail
made
towards
claw
cape
which
had
to
be
doubled
in
order
to
proceed
to
the
southwest
the
bonadventure
was
already
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
coast
when
the
passengers
perceived
on
the
heights
of
granite
house
two
men
waving
their
farewells
they
were
cyrus
harding
and
neb
our
friends
exclaimed
spilett
this
is
our
first
separation
in
fifteen
months
pencroft
the
reporter
and
herbert
waved
in
return
and
granite
house
soon
disappeared
behind
the
high
rocks
of
the
cape
during
the
first
part
of
the
day
the
bonadventure
was
still
in
sight
of
the
southern
coast
of
lincoln
island
which
soon
appeared
just
like
a
green
basket
with
mount
franklin
rising
from
the
center
the
heights
diminished
by
distance
did
not
present
an
appearance
likely
to
tempt
vessels
to
touch
there
reptile
end
was
passed
in
about
an
hour
though
at
a
distance
of
about
ten
miles
at
this
distance
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
distinguish
anything
of
the
western
coast
which
stretched
away
to
the
ridges
of
mount
franklin
and
three
hours
after
the
last
of
lincoln
island
sank
below
the
horizon
the
bonadventure
behaved
capitally
bounding
over
the
waves
she
proceeded
rapidly
on
her
course
pencroft
had
hoisted
the
foresail
and
steering
by
the
compass
followed
a
rectilinear
direction
from
time
to
time
herbert
relieved
him
at
the
helm
and
the
lads
hand
was
so
firm
that
the
sailor
had
not
a
point
to
find
fault
with
gideon
spilett
chatted
sometimes
with
one
sometimes
with
the
other
if
wanted
he
lent
a
hand
with
the
ropes
and
captain
pencroft
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
crew
in
the
evening
the
crescent
moon
which
would
not
be
in
its
first
quarter
until
the
16th
appeared
in
the
twilight
and
soon
set
again
the
night
was
dark
but
starry
and
the
next
day
again
promised
to
be
fine
pencroft
prudently
lowered
the
foresail
not
wishing
to
be
caught
by
a
sudden
gust
while
carrying
too
much
canvas
it
was
perhaps
an
unnecessary
precaution
on
such
a
calm
night
but
pencroft
was
a
prudent
sailor
and
cannot
be
blamed
for
it
the
reporter
slept
part
of
the
night
pencroft
and
herbert
took
turns
for
a
spell
of
two
hours
each
at
the
helm
the
sailor
trusted
herbert
as
he
would
himself
and
his
confidence
was
justified
by
the
coolness
and
judgment
of
the
lad
pencroft
gave
him
his
directions
as
a
commander
to
his
steersman
and
herbert
never
allowed
the
bonadventure
to
swerve
even
a
point
the
night
passed
quickly
as
did
the
day
of
the
12th
of
october
a
southeasterly
direction
was
strictly
maintained
unless
the
bonadventure
fell
in
with
some
unknown
current
she
would
come
exactly
within
sight
of
tabor
island
as
to
the
sea
over
which
the
vessel
was
then
sailing
it
was
absolutely
deserted
now
and
then
a
great
albatross
or
frigate
bird
passed
within
gunshot
and
gideon
spilett
wondered
if
it
was
to
one
of
them
that
he
had
confided
his
last
letter
addressed
to
the
new
york
herald
these
birds
were
the
only
beings
that
appeared
to
frequent
this
part
of
the
ocean
between
tabor
and
lincoln
islands
and
yet
observed
herbert
this
is
the
time
that
whalers
usually
proceed
towards
the
southern
part
of
the
pacific
indeed
i
do
not
think
there
could
be
a
more
deserted
sea
than
this
it
is
not
quite
so
deserted
as
all
that
replied
pencroft
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
reporter
we
are
on
it
do
you
take
our
vessel
for
a
wreck
and
us
for
porpoises
and
pencroft
laughed
at
his
joke
by
the
evening
according
to
calculation
it
was
thought
that
the
bonadventure
had
accomplished
a
distance
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
since
her
departure
from
lincoln
island
that
is
to
say
in
thirtysix
hours
which
would
give
her
a
speed
of
between
three
and
four
knots
the
breeze
was
very
slight
and
might
soon
drop
altogether
however
it
was
hoped
that
the
next
morning
by
break
of
day
if
the
calculation
had
been
correct
and
the
course
true
they
would
sight
tabor
island
neither
gideon
spilett
herbert
nor
pencroft
slept
that
night
in
the
expectation
of
the
next
day
they
could
not
but
feel
some
emotion
there
was
so
much
uncertainty
in
their
enterprise
were
they
near
tabor
island
was
the
island
still
inhabited
by
the
castaway
to
whose
succor
they
had
come
who
was
this
man
would
not
his
presence
disturb
the
little
colony
till
then
so
united
besides
would
he
be
content
to
exchange
his
prison
for
another
all
these
questions
which
would
no
doubt
be
answered
the
next
day
kept
them
in
suspense
and
at
the
dawn
of
day
they
all
fixed
their
gaze
on
the
western
horizon
land
shouted
pencroft
at
about
six
oclock
in
the
morning
and
it
was
impossible
that
pencroft
should
be
mistaken
it
was
evident
that
land
was
there
imagine
the
joy
of
the
little
crew
of
the
bonadventure
in
a
few
hours
they
would
land
on
the
beach
of
the
island
the
low
coast
of
tabor
island
scarcely
emerging
from
the
sea
was
not
more
than
fifteen
miles
distant
the
head
of
the
bonadventure
which
was
a
little
to
the
south
of
the
island
was
set
directly
towards
it
and
as
the
sun
mounted
in
the
east
its
rays
fell
upon
one
or
two
headlands
this
is
a
much
less
important
isle
than
lincoln
island
observed
herbert
and
is
probably
due
like
ours
to
some
submarine
convulsion
at
eleven
oclock
the
bonadventure
was
not
more
than
two
miles
off
and
pencroft
while
looking
for
a
suitable
place
at
which
to
land
proceeded
very
cautiously
through
the
unknown
waters
the
whole
of
the
island
could
now
be
surveyed
and
on
it
could
be
seen
groups
of
gum
and
other
large
trees
of
the
same
species
as
those
growing
on
lincoln
island
but
the
astonishing
thing
was
that
no
smoke
arose
to
show
that
the
island
was
inhabited
no
signal
whatever
appeared
on
the
shore
and
yet
the
document
was
clear
enough
there
was
a
castaway
and
this
castaway
should
have
been
on
the
watch
in
the
meanwhile
the
bonadventure
entered
the
winding
channels
among
the
reefs
and
pencroft
observed
every
turn
with
extreme
care
he
had
put
herbert
at
the
helm
posting
himself
in
the
bows
inspecting
the
water
while
he
held
the
halliard
in
his
hand
ready
to
lower
the
sail
at
a
moments
notice
gideon
spilett
with
his
glass
eagerly
scanned
the
shore
though
without
perceiving
anything
however
at
about
twelve
oclock
the
keel
of
the
bonadventure
grated
on
the
bottom
the
anchor
was
let
go
the
sails
furled
and
the
crew
of
the
little
vessel
landed
and
there
was
no
reason
to
doubt
that
this
was
tabor
island
since
according
to
the
most
recent
charts
there
was
no
island
in
this
part
of
the
pacific
between
new
zealand
and
the
american
coast
the
vessel
was
securely
moored
so
that
there
should
be
no
danger
of
her
being
carried
away
by
the
receding
tide
then
pencroft
and
his
companions
well
armed
ascended
the
shore
so
as
to
gain
an
elevation
of
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
or
three
hundred
feet
which
rose
at
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
from
the
summit
of
that
hill
said
spilett
we
can
no
doubt
obtain
a
complete
view
of
the
island
which
will
greatly
facilitate
our
search
so
as
to
do
here
replied
herbert
that
which
captain
harding
did
the
very
first
thing
on
lincoln
island
by
climbing
mount
franklin
exactly
so
answered
the
reporter
and
it
is
the
best
plan
while
thus
talking
the
explorers
had
advanced
along
a
clearing
which
terminated
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
flocks
of
rockpigeons
and
seaswallows
similar
to
those
of
lincoln
island
fluttered
around
them
under
the
woods
which
skirted
the
glade
on
the
left
they
could
hear
the
bushes
rustling
and
see
the
grass
waving
which
indicated
the
presence
of
timid
animals
but
still
nothing
to
show
that
the
island
was
inhabited
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
pencroft
spilett
and
herbert
climbed
it
in
a
few
minutes
and
gazed
anxiously
round
the
horizon
they
were
on
an
islet
which
did
not
measure
more
than
six
miles
in
circumference
its
shape
not
much
bordered
by
capes
or
promontories
bays
or
creeks
being
a
lengthened
oval
all
around
the
lonely
sea
extended
to
the
limits
of
the
horizon
no
land
nor
even
a
sail
was
in
sight
this
woody
islet
did
not
offer
the
varied
aspects
of
lincoln
island
arid
and
wild
in
one
part
but
fertile
and
rich
in
the
other
on
the
contrary
this
was
a
uniform
mass
of
verdure
out
of
which
rose
two
or
three
hills
of
no
great
height
obliquely
to
the
oval
of
the
island
ran
a
stream
through
a
wide
meadow
falling
into
the
sea
on
the
west
by
a
narrow
mouth
the
domain
is
limited
said
herbert
yes
rejoined
pencroft
it
would
have
been
too
small
for
us
and
moreover
said
the
reporter
it
appears
to
be
uninhabited
indeed
answered
herbert
nothing
here
betrays
the
presence
of
man
let
us
go
down
said
pencroft
and
search
the
sailor
and
his
two
companions
returned
to
the
shore
to
the
place
where
they
had
left
the
bonadventure
they
had
decided
to
make
the
tour
of
the
island
on
foot
before
exploring
the
interior
so
that
not
a
spot
should
escape
their
investigations
the
beach
was
easy
to
follow
and
only
in
some
places
was
their
way
barred
by
large
rocks
which
however
they
easily
passed
round
the
explorers
proceeded
towards
the
south
disturbing
numerous
flocks
of
seabirds
and
herds
of
seals
which
threw
themselves
into
the
sea
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
strangers
at
a
distance
those
beasts
yonder
observed
the
reporter
do
not
see
men
for
the
first
time
they
fear
them
therefore
they
must
know
them
an
hour
after
their
departure
they
arrived
on
the
southern
point
of
the
islet
terminated
by
a
sharp
cape
and
proceeded
towards
the
north
along
the
western
coast
equally
formed
by
sand
and
rocks
the
background
bordered
with
thick
woods
there
was
not
a
trace
of
a
habitation
in
any
part
not
the
print
of
a
human
foot
on
the
shore
of
the
island
which
after
four
hours
walking
had
been
gone
completely
round
it
was
to
say
the
least
very
extraordinary
and
they
were
compelled
to
believe
that
tabor
island
was
not
or
was
no
longer
inhabited
perhaps
after
all
the
document
was
already
several
months
or
several
years
old
and
it
was
possible
in
this
case
either
that
the
castaway
had
been
enabled
to
return
to
his
country
or
that
he
had
died
of
misery
pencroft
spilett
and
herbert
forming
more
or
less
probable
conjectures
dined
rapidly
on
board
the
bonadventure
so
as
to
be
able
to
continue
their
excursion
until
nightfall
this
was
done
at
five
oclock
in
the
evening
at
which
hour
they
entered
the
wood
numerous
animals
fled
at
their
approach
being
principally
one
might
say
only
goats
and
pigs
which
were
obviously
european
species
doubtless
some
whaler
had
landed
them
on
the
island
where
they
had
rapidly
increased
herbert
resolved
to
catch
one
or
two
living
and
take
them
back
to
lincoln
island
it
was
no
longer
doubtful
that
men
at
some
period
or
other
had
visited
this
islet
and
this
became
still
more
evident
when
paths
appeared
trodden
through
the
forest
felled
trees
and
everywhere
traces
of
the
hand
of
man
but
the
trees
were
becoming
rotten
and
had
been
felled
many
years
ago
the
marks
of
the
axe
were
velveted
with
moss
and
the
grass
grew
long
and
thick
on
the
paths
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
find
them
but
observed
gideon
spilett
this
not
only
proves
that
men
have
landed
on
the
island
but
also
that
they
lived
on
it
for
some
time
now
who
were
these
men
how
many
of
them
remain
the
document
said
herbert
only
spoke
of
one
castaway
well
if
he
is
still
on
the
island
replied
pencroft
it
is
impossible
but
that
we
shall
find
him
the
exploration
was
continued
the
sailor
and
his
companions
naturally
followed
the
route
which
cut
diagonally
across
the
island
and
they
were
thus
obliged
to
follow
the
stream
which
flowed
towards
the
sea
if
the
animals
of
european
origin
if
works
due
to
a
human
hand
showed
incontestably
that
men
had
already
visited
the
island
several
specimens
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
did
not
prove
it
less
in
some
places
in
the
midst
of
clearings
it
was
evident
that
the
soil
had
been
planted
with
culinary
plants
at
probably
the
same
distant
period
what
then
was
herberts
joy
when
he
recognized
potatoes
chicory
sorrel
carrots
cabbages
and
turnips
of
which
it
was
sufficient
to
collect
the
seed
to
enrich
the
soil
of
lincoln
island
capital
jolly
exclaimed
pencroft
that
will
suit
neb
as
well
as
us
even
if
we
do
not
find
the
castaway
at
least
our
voyage
will
not
have
been
useless
and
god
will
have
rewarded
us
doubtless
replied
gideon
spilett
but
to
see
the
state
in
which
we
find
these
plantations
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
island
has
not
been
inhabited
for
some
time
indeed
answered
herbert
an
inhabitant
whoever
he
was
could
not
have
neglected
such
an
important
culture
yes
said
pencroft
the
castaway
has
gone
we
must
suppose
so
it
must
then
be
admitted
that
the
document
has
already
a
distant
date
evidently
and
that
the
bottle
only
arrived
at
lincoln
island
after
having
floated
in
the
sea
a
long
time
why
not
returned
pencroft
but
night
is
coming
on
added
he
and
i
think
that
it
will
be
best
to
give
up
the
search
for
the
present
let
us
go
on
board
and
tomorrow
we
will
begin
again
said
the
reporter
this
was
the
wisest
course
and
it
was
about
to
be
followed
when
herbert
pointing
to
a
confused
mass
among
the
trees
exclaimed
a
hut
all
three
immediately
ran
towards
the
dwelling
in
the
twilight
it
was
just
possible
to
see
that
it
was
built
of
planks
and
covered
with
a
thick
tarpaulin
the
halfclosed
door
was
pushed
open
by
pencroft
who
entered
with
a
rapid
step
the
hut
was
empty

pencroft
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
remained
silent
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
pencroft
shouted
loudly
no
reply
was
made
the
sailor
then
struck
a
light
and
set
fire
to
a
twig
this
lighted
for
a
minute
a
small
room
which
appeared
perfectly
empty
at
the
back
was
a
rude
fireplace
with
a
few
cold
cinders
supporting
an
armful
of
dry
wood
pencroft
threw
the
blazing
twig
on
it
the
wood
crackled
and
gave
forth
a
bright
light
the
sailor
and
his
two
companions
then
perceived
a
disordered
bed
of
which
the
damp
and
yellow
coverlets
proved
that
it
had
not
been
used
for
a
long
time
in
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
were
two
kettles
covered
with
rust
and
an
overthrown
pot
a
cupboard
with
a
few
moldy
sailors
clothes
on
the
table
a
tin
plate
and
a
bible
eaten
away
by
damp
in
a
corner
a
few
tools
a
spade
pickaxe
two
fowlingpieces
one
of
which
was
broken
on
a
plank
forming
a
shelf
stood
a
barrel
of
powder
still
untouched
a
barrel
of
shot
and
several
boxes
of
caps
all
thickly
covered
with
dust
accumulated
perhaps
by
many
long
years
there
is
no
one
here
said
the
reporter
no
one
replied
pencroft
it
is
a
long
time
since
this
room
has
been
inhabited
observed
herbert
yes
a
very
long
time
answered
the
reporter
mr
spilett
then
said
pencroft
instead
of
returning
on
board
i
think
that
it
would
be
well
to
pass
the
night
in
this
hut
you
are
right
pencroft
answered
gideon
spilett
and
if
its
owner
returns
well
perhaps
he
will
not
be
sorry
to
find
the
place
taken
possession
of
he
will
not
return
said
the
sailor
shaking
his
head
you
think
that
he
has
quitted
the
island
asked
the
reporter
if
he
had
quitted
the
island
he
would
have
taken
away
his
weapons
and
his
tools
replied
pencroft
you
know
the
value
which
castaways
set
on
such
articles
as
these
the
last
remains
of
a
wreck
no
no
repeated
the
sailor
in
a
tone
of
conviction
no
he
has
not
left
the
island
if
he
had
escaped
in
a
boat
made
by
himself
he
would
still
less
have
left
these
indispensable
and
necessary
articles
no
he
is
on
the
island
living
asked
herbert
living
or
dead
but
if
he
is
dead
i
suppose
he
has
not
buried
himself
and
so
we
shall
at
least
find
his
remains
it
was
then
agreed
that
the
night
should
be
passed
in
the
deserted
dwelling
and
a
store
of
wood
found
in
a
corner
was
sufficient
to
warm
it
the
door
closed
pencroft
herbert
and
spilett
remained
there
seated
on
a
bench
talking
little
but
wondering
much
they
were
in
a
frame
of
mind
to
imagine
anything
or
expect
anything
they
listened
eagerly
for
sounds
outside
the
door
might
have
opened
suddenly
and
a
man
presented
himself
to
them
without
their
being
in
the
least
surprised
notwithstanding
all
that
the
hut
revealed
of
abandonment
and
they
had
their
hands
ready
to
press
the
hands
of
this
man
this
castaway
this
unknown
friend
for
whom
friends
were
waiting
but
no
voice
was
heard
the
door
did
not
open
the
hours
thus
passed
away
how
long
the
night
appeared
to
the
sailor
and
his
companions
herbert
alone
slept
for
two
hours
for
at
his
age
sleep
is
a
necessity
they
were
all
three
anxious
to
continue
their
exploration
of
the
day
before
and
to
search
the
most
secret
recesses
of
the
islet
the
inferences
deduced
by
pencroft
were
perfectly
reasonable
and
it
was
nearly
certain
that
as
the
hut
was
deserted
and
the
tools
utensils
and
weapons
were
still
there
the
owner
had
succumbed
it
was
agreed
therefore
that
they
should
search
for
his
remains
and
give
them
at
least
christian
burial
day
dawned
pencroft
and
his
companions
immediately
proceeded
to
survey
the
dwelling
it
had
certainly
been
built
in
a
favorable
situation
at
the
back
of
a
little
hill
sheltered
by
five
or
six
magnificent
gumtrees
before
its
front
and
through
the
trees
the
axe
had
prepared
a
wide
clearing
which
allowed
the
view
to
extend
to
the
sea
beyond
a
lawn
surrounded
by
a
wooden
fence
falling
to
pieces
was
the
shore
on
the
left
of
which
was
the
mouth
of
the
stream
the
hut
had
been
built
of
planks
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
these
planks
had
been
obtained
from
the
hull
or
deck
of
a
ship
it
was
probable
that
a
disabled
vessel
had
been
cast
on
the
coast
of
the
island
that
one
at
least
of
the
crew
had
been
saved
and
that
by
means
of
the
wreck
this
man
having
tools
at
his
disposal
had
built
the
dwelling
and
this
became
still
more
evident
when
gideon
spilett
after
having
walked
around
the
hut
saw
on
a
plank
probably
one
of
those
which
had
formed
the
armor
of
the
wrecked
vessel
these
letters
already
half
effaced
brtana
britannia
exclaimed
pencroft
whom
the
reporter
had
called
it
is
a
common
name
for
ships
and
i
could
not
say
if
she
was
english
or
american
it
matters
very
little
pencroft
very
little
indeed
answered
the
sailor
and
we
will
save
the
survivor
of
her
crew
if
he
is
still
living
to
whatever
country
he
may
belong
but
before
beginning
our
search
again
let
us
go
on
board
the
bonadventure
a
sort
of
uneasiness
had
seized
pencroft
upon
the
subject
of
his
vessel
should
the
island
be
inhabited
after
all
and
should
some
one
have
taken
possession
of
her
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
such
an
unreasonable
supposition
at
any
rate
the
sailor
was
not
sorry
to
go
to
breakfast
on
board
the
road
already
trodden
was
not
long
scarcely
a
mile
they
set
out
on
their
walk
gazing
into
the
wood
and
thickets
through
which
goats
and
pigs
fled
in
hundreds
twenty
minutes
after
leaving
the
hut
pencroft
and
his
companions
reached
the
western
coast
of
the
island
and
saw
the
bonadventure
held
fast
by
her
anchor
which
was
buried
deep
in
the
sand
pencroft
could
not
restrain
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
after
all
this
vessel
was
his
child
and
it
is
the
right
of
fathers
to
be
often
uneasy
when
there
is
no
occasion
for
it
they
returned
on
board
breakfasted
so
that
it
should
not
be
necessary
to
dine
until
very
late
then
the
repast
being
ended
the
exploration
was
continued
and
conducted
with
the
most
minute
care
indeed
it
was
very
probable
that
the
only
inhabitant
of
the
island
had
perished
it
was
therefore
more
for
the
traces
of
a
dead
than
of
a
living
man
that
pencroft
and
his
companions
searched
but
their
searches
were
vain
and
during
the
half
of
that
day
they
sought
to
no
purpose
among
the
thickets
of
trees
which
covered
the
islet
there
was
then
scarcely
any
doubt
that
if
the
castaway
was
dead
no
trace
of
his
body
now
remained
but
that
some
wild
beast
had
probably
devoured
it
to
the
last
bone
we
will
set
off
tomorrow
at
daybreak
said
pencroft
to
his
two
companions
as
about
two
oclock
they
were
resting
for
a
few
minutes
under
the
shade
of
a
clump
of
firs
i
should
think
that
we
might
without
scruple
take
the
utensils
which
belonged
to
the
castaway
added
herbert
i
think
so
too
returned
gideon
spilett
and
these
arms
and
tools
will
make
up
the
stores
of
granite
house
the
supply
of
powder
and
shot
is
also
most
important
yes
replied
pencroft
but
we
must
not
forget
to
capture
a
couple
or
two
of
those
pigs
of
which
lincoln
island
is
destitute
nor
to
gather
those
seeds
added
herbert
which
will
give
us
all
the
vegetables
of
the
old
and
the
new
worlds
then
perhaps
it
would
be
best
said
the
reporter
to
remain
a
day
longer
on
tabor
island
so
as
to
collect
all
that
may
be
useful
to
us
no
mr
spilett
answered
pencroft
i
will
ask
you
to
set
off
tomorrow
at
daybreak
the
wind
seems
to
me
to
be
likely
to
shift
to
the
west
and
after
having
had
a
fair
wind
for
coming
we
shall
have
a
fair
wind
for
going
back
then
do
not
let
us
lose
time
said
herbert
rising
we
wont
waste
time
returned
pencroft
you
herbert
go
and
gather
the
seeds
which
you
know
better
than
we
do
while
you
do
that
mr
spilett
and
i
will
go
and
have
a
pig
hunt
and
even
without
top
i
hope
we
shall
manage
to
catch
a
few
herbert
accordingly
took
the
path
which
led
towards
the
cultivated
part
of
the
islet
while
the
sailor
and
the
reporter
entered
the
forest
many
specimens
of
the
porcine
race
fled
before
them
and
these
animals
which
were
singularly
active
did
not
appear
to
be
in
a
humor
to
allow
themselves
to
be
approached
however
after
an
hours
chase
the
hunters
had
just
managed
to
get
hold
of
a
couple
lying
in
a
thicket
when
cries
were
heard
resounding
from
the
north
part
of
the
island
with
the
cries
were
mingled
terrible
yells
in
which
there
was
nothing
human
pencroft
and
gideon
spilett
were
at
once
on
their
feet
and
the
pigs
by
this
movement
began
to
run
away
at
the
moment
when
the
sailor
was
getting
ready
the
rope
to
bind
them
thats
herberts
voice
said
the
reporter
run
exclaimed
pencroft
and
the
sailor
and
spilett
immediately
ran
at
full
speed
towards
the
spot
from
whence
the
cries
proceeded
they
did
well
to
hasten
for
at
a
turn
of
the
path
near
a
clearing
they
saw
the
lad
thrown
on
the
ground
and
in
the
grasp
of
a
savage
being
apparently
a
gigantic
ape
who
was
about
to
do
him
some
great
harm
to
rush
on
this
monster
throw
him
on
the
ground
in
his
turn
snatch
herbert
from
him
then
bind
him
securely
was
the
work
of
a
minute
for
pencroft
and
gideon
spilett
the
sailor
was
of
herculean
strength
the
reporter
also
very
powerful
and
in
spite
of
the
monsters
resistance
he
was
firmly
tied
so
that
he
could
not
even
move
you
are
not
hurt
herbert
asked
spilett
no
no
oh
if
this
ape
had
wounded
him
exclaimed
pencroft
but
he
is
not
an
ape
answered
herbert
at
these
words
pencroft
and
gideon
spilett
looked
at
the
singular
being
who
lay
on
the
ground
indeed
it
was
not
an
ape
it
was
a
human
being
a
man
but
what
a
man
a
savage
in
all
the
horrible
acceptation
of
the
word
and
so
much
the
more
frightful
that
he
seemed
fallen
to
the
lowest
degree
of
brutishness
shaggy
hair
untrimmed
beard
descending
to
the
chest
the
body
almost
naked
except
a
rag
round
the
waist
wild
eyes
enormous
hands
with
immensely
long
nails
skin
the
color
of
mahogany
feet
as
hard
as
if
made
of
horn
such
was
the
miserable
creature
who
yet
had
a
claim
to
be
called
a
man
but
it
might
justly
be
asked
if
there
were
yet
a
soul
in
this
body
or
if
the
brute
instinct
alone
survived
in
it
are
you
quite
sure
that
this
is
a
man
or
that
he
has
ever
been
one
said
pencroft
to
the
reporter
alas
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
replied
spilett
then
this
must
be
the
castaway
asked
herbert
yes
replied
gideon
spilett
but
the
unfortunate
man
has
no
longer
anything
human
about
him
the
reporter
spoke
the
truth
it
was
evident
that
if
the
castaway
had
ever
been
a
civilized
being
solitude
had
made
him
a
savage
or
worse
perhaps
a
regular
man
of
the
woods
hoarse
sounds
issued
from
his
throat
between
his
teeth
which
were
sharp
as
the
teeth
of
a
wild
beast
made
to
tear
raw
flesh
memory
must
have
deserted
him
long
before
and
for
a
long
time
also
he
had
forgotten
how
to
use
his
gun
and
tools
and
he
no
longer
knew
how
to
make
a
fire
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
active
and
powerful
but
the
physical
qualities
had
been
developed
in
him
to
the
injury
of
the
moral
qualities
gideon
spilett
spoke
to
him
he
did
not
appear
to
understand
or
even
to
hear
and
yet
on
looking
into
his
eyes
the
reporter
thought
he
could
see
that
all
reason
was
not
extinguished
in
him
however
the
prisoner
did
not
struggle
nor
even
attempt
to
break
his
bonds
was
he
overwhelmed
by
the
presence
of
men
whose
fellow
he
had
once
been
had
he
found
in
some
corner
of
his
brain
a
fleeting
remembrance
which
recalled
him
to
humanity
if
free
would
he
attempt
to
fly
or
would
he
remain
they
could
not
tell
but
they
did
not
make
the
experiment
and
after
gazing
attentively
at
the
miserable
creature
whoever
he
may
be
remarked
gideon
spilett
whoever
he
may
have
been
and
whatever
he
may
become
it
is
our
duty
to
take
him
with
us
to
lincoln
island
yes
yes
replied
herbert
and
perhaps
with
care
we
may
arouse
in
him
some
gleam
of
intelligence
the
soul
does
not
die
said
the
reporter
and
it
would
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
rescue
one
of
gods
creatures
from
brutishness
pencroft
shook
his
head
doubtfully
we
must
try
at
any
rate
returned
the
reporter
humanity
commands
us
it
was
indeed
their
duty
as
christians
and
civilized
beings
all
three
felt
this
and
they
well
knew
that
cyrus
harding
would
approve
of
their
acting
thus
shall
we
leave
him
bound
asked
the
sailor
perhaps
he
would
walk
if
his
feet
were
unfastened
said
herbert
let
us
try
replied
pencroft
the
cords
which
shackled
the
prisoners
feet
were
cut
off
but
his
arms
remained
securely
fastened
he
got
up
by
himself
and
did
not
manifest
any
desire
to
run
away
his
hard
eyes
darted
a
piercing
glance
at
the
three
men
who
walked
near
him
but
nothing
denoted
that
he
recollected
being
their
fellow
or
at
least
having
been
so
a
continual
hissing
sound
issued
from
his
lips
his
aspect
was
wild
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
resist
by
the
reporters
advice
the
unfortunate
man
was
taken
to
the
hut
perhaps
the
sight
of
the
things
that
belonged
to
him
would
make
some
impression
on
him
perhaps
a
spark
would
be
sufficient
to
revive
his
obscured
intellect
to
rekindle
his
dulled
soul
the
dwelling
was
not
far
off
in
a
few
minutes
they
arrived
there
but
the
prisoner
remembered
nothing
and
it
appeared
that
he
had
lost
consciousness
of
everything
what
could
they
think
of
the
degree
of
brutishness
into
which
this
miserable
being
had
fallen
unless
that
his
imprisonment
on
the
islet
dated
from
a
very
distant
period
and
after
having
arrived
there
a
rational
being
solitude
had
reduced
him
to
this
condition
the
reporter
then
thought
that
perhaps
the
sight
of
fire
would
have
some
effect
on
him
and
in
a
moment
one
of
those
beautiful
flames
that
attract
even
animals
blazed
up
on
the
hearth
the
sight
of
the
flame
seemed
at
first
to
fix
the
attention
of
the
unhappy
object
but
soon
he
turned
away
and
the
look
of
intelligence
faded
evidently
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
the
time
at
least
but
to
take
him
on
board
the
bonadventure
this
was
done
and
he
remained
there
in
pencrofts
charge
herbert
and
spilett
returned
to
finish
their
work
and
some
hours
after
they
came
back
to
the
shore
carrying
the
utensils
and
guns
a
store
of
vegetables
of
seeds
some
game
and
two
couple
of
pigs
all
was
embarked
and
the
bonadventure
was
ready
to
weigh
anchor
and
sail
with
the
morning
tide
the
prisoner
had
been
placed
in
the
forecabin
where
he
remained
quiet
silent
apparently
deaf
and
dumb
pencroft
offered
him
something
to
eat
but
he
pushed
away
the
cooked
meat
that
was
presented
to
him
and
which
doubtless
did
not
suit
him
but
on
the
sailor
showing
him
one
of
the
ducks
which
herbert
had
killed
he
pounced
on
it
like
a
wild
beast
and
devoured
it
greedily
you
think
that
he
will
recover
his
senses
asked
pencroft
it
is
not
impossible
that
our
care
will
have
an
effect
upon
him
for
it
is
solitude
that
has
made
him
what
he
is
and
from
this
time
forward
he
will
be
no
longer
alone
the
poor
man
must
no
doubt
have
been
in
this
state
for
a
long
time
said
herbert
perhaps
answered
gideon
spilett
about
what
age
is
he
asked
the
lad
it
is
difficult
to
say
replied
the
reporter
for
it
is
impossible
to
see
his
features
under
the
thick
beard
which
covers
his
face
but
he
is
no
longer
young
and
i
suppose
he
might
be
about
fifty
have
you
noticed
mr
spilett
how
deeply
sunk
his
eyes
are
asked
herbert
yes
herbert
but
i
must
add
that
they
are
more
human
than
one
could
expect
from
his
appearance
however
we
shall
see
replied
pencroft
and
i
am
anxious
to
know
what
opinion
captain
harding
will
have
of
our
savage
we
went
to
look
for
a
human
creature
and
we
are
bringing
back
a
monster
after
all
we
did
what
we
could
the
night
passed
and
whether
the
prisoner
slept
or
not
could
not
be
known
but
at
any
rate
although
he
had
been
unbound
he
did
not
move
he
was
like
a
wild
animal
which
appears
stunned
at
first
by
its
capture
and
becomes
wild
again
afterwards
at
daybreak
the
next
morning
the
15th
of
october
the
change
of
weather
predicted
by
pencroft
occurred
the
wind
having
shifted
to
the
northwest
favored
the
return
of
the
bonadventure
but
at
the
same
time
it
freshened
which
might
render
navigation
more
difficult
at
five
oclock
in
the
morning
the
anchor
was
weighed
pencroft
took
a
reef
in
the
mainsail
and
steered
towards
the
northeast
so
as
to
sail
straight
for
lincoln
island
the
first
day
of
the
voyage
was
not
marked
by
any
incident
the
prisoner
remained
quiet
in
the
forecabin
and
as
he
had
been
a
sailor
it
appeared
that
the
motion
of
the
vessel
might
produce
on
him
a
salutary
reaction
did
some
recollection
of
his
former
calling
return
to
him
however
that
might
be
he
remained
tranquil
astonished
rather
than
depressed
the
next
day
the
wind
increased
blowing
more
from
the
north
consequently
in
a
less
favorable
direction
for
the
bonadventure
pencroft
was
soon
obliged
to
sail
closehauled
and
without
saying
anything
about
it
he
began
to
be
uneasy
at
the
state
of
the
sea
which
frequently
broke
over
the
bows
certainly
if
the
wind
did
not
moderate
it
would
take
a
longer
time
to
reach
lincoln
island
than
it
had
taken
to
make
tabor
island
indeed
on
the
morning
of
the
17th
the
bonadventure
had
been
fortyeight
hours
at
sea
and
nothing
showed
that
she
was
near
the
island
it
was
impossible
besides
to
estimate
the
distance
traversed
or
to
trust
to
the
reckoning
for
the
direction
as
the
speed
had
been
very
irregular
twentyfour
hours
after
there
was
yet
no
land
in
sight
the
wind
was
right
ahead
and
the
sea
very
heavy
the
sails
were
closereefed
and
they
tacked
frequently
on
the
18th
a
wave
swept
completely
over
the
bonadventure
and
if
the
crew
had
not
taken
the
precaution
of
lashing
themselves
to
the
deck
they
would
have
been
carried
away
on
this
occasion
pencroft
and
his
companions
who
were
occupied
with
loosing
themselves
received
unexpected
aid
from
the
prisoner
who
emerged
from
the
hatchway
as
if
his
sailors
instinct
had
suddenly
returned
broke
a
piece
out
of
the
bulwarks
with
a
spar
so
as
to
let
the
water
which
filled
the
deck
escape
then
the
vessel
being
clear
he
descended
to
his
cabin
without
having
uttered
a
word
pencroft
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
greatly
astonished
let
him
proceed
their
situation
was
truly
serious
and
the
sailor
had
reason
to
fear
that
he
was
lost
on
the
wide
sea
without
any
possibility
of
recovering
his
course
the
night
was
dark
and
cold
however
about
eleven
oclock
the
wind
fell
the
sea
went
down
and
the
speed
of
the
vessel
as
she
labored
less
greatly
increased
neither
pencroft
spilett
nor
herbert
thought
of
taking
an
hours
sleep
they
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
either
lincoln
island
could
not
be
far
distant
and
would
be
sighted
at
daybreak
or
the
bonadventure
carried
away
by
currents
had
drifted
so
much
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
rectify
her
course
pencroft
uneasy
to
the
last
degree
yet
did
not
despair
for
he
had
a
gallant
heart
and
grasping
the
tiller
he
anxiously
endeavored
to
pierce
the
darkness
which
surrounded
them
about
two
oclock
in
the
morning
he
started
forward
a
light
a
light
he
shouted
indeed
a
bright
light
appeared
twenty
miles
to
the
northeast
lincoln
island
was
there
and
this
fire
evidently
lighted
by
cyrus
harding
showed
them
the
course
to
be
followed
pencroft
who
was
bearing
too
much
to
the
north
altered
his
course
and
steered
towards
the
fire
which
burned
brightly
above
the
horizon
like
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
chapter
15
the
next
day
the
20th
of
october
at
seven
oclock
in
the
morning
after
a
voyage
of
four
days
the
bonadventure
gently
glided
up
to
the
beach
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
cyrus
harding
and
neb
who
had
become
very
uneasy
at
the
bad
weather
and
the
prolonged
absence
of
their
companions
had
climbed
at
daybreak
to
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
and
they
had
at
last
caught
sight
of
the
vessel
which
had
been
so
long
in
returning
god
be
praised
there
they
are
exclaimed
cyrus
harding
as
to
neb
in
his
joy
he
began
to
dance
to
twirl
round
clapping
his
hands
and
shouting
oh
my
master
a
more
touching
pantomime
than
the
finest
discourse
the
engineers
first
idea
on
counting
the
people
on
the
deck
of
the
bonadventure
was
that
pencroft
had
not
found
the
castaway
of
tabor
island
or
at
any
rate
that
the
unfortunate
man
had
refused
to
leave
his
island
and
change
one
prison
for
another
indeed
pencroft
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
were
alone
on
the
deck
of
the
bonadventure
the
moment
the
vessel
touched
the
engineer
and
neb
were
waiting
on
the
beach
and
before
the
passengers
had
time
to
leap
on
to
the
sand
harding
said
we
have
been
very
uneasy
at
your
delay
my
friends
did
you
meet
with
any
accident
no
replied
gideon
spilett
on
the
contrary
everything
went
wonderfully
well
we
will
tell
you
all
about
it
however
returned
the
engineer
your
search
has
been
unsuccessful
since
you
are
only
three
just
as
you
went
excuse
me
captain
replied
the
sailor
we
are
four
you
have
found
the
castaway
yes
and
you
have
brought
him
yes
living
yes
where
is
he
who
is
he
he
is
replied
the
reporter
or
rather
he
was
a
man
there
cyrus
that
is
all
we
can
tell
you
the
engineer
was
then
informed
of
all
that
had
passed
during
the
voyage
and
under
what
conditions
the
search
had
been
conducted
how
the
only
dwelling
in
the
island
had
long
been
abandoned
how
at
last
a
castaway
had
been
captured
who
appeared
no
longer
to
belong
to
the
human
species
and
thats
just
the
point
added
pencroft
i
dont
know
if
we
have
done
right
to
bring
him
here
certainly
you
have
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
quickly
but
the
wretched
creature
has
no
sense
that
is
possible
at
present
replied
cyrus
harding
but
only
a
few
months
ago
the
wretched
creature
was
a
man
like
you
and
me
and
who
knows
what
will
become
of
the
survivor
of
us
after
a
long
solitude
on
this
island
it
is
a
great
misfortune
to
be
alone
my
friends
and
it
must
be
believed
that
solitude
can
quickly
destroy
reason
since
you
have
found
this
poor
creature
in
such
a
state
but
captain
asked
herbert
what
leads
you
to
think
that
the
brutishness
of
the
unfortunate
man
began
only
a
few
months
back
because
the
document
we
found
had
been
recently
written
answered
the
engineer
and
the
castaway
alone
can
have
written
it
always
supposing
observed
gideon
spilett
that
it
had
not
been
written
by
a
companion
of
this
man
since
dead
that
is
impossible
my
dear
spilett
why
so
asked
the
reporter
because
the
document
would
then
have
spoken
of
two
castaways
replied
harding
and
it
mentioned
only
one
herbert
then
in
a
few
words
related
the
incidents
of
the
voyage
and
dwelt
on
the
curious
fact
of
the
sort
of
passing
gleam
in
the
prisoners
mind
when
for
an
instant
in
the
height
of
the
storm
he
had
become
a
sailor
well
herbert
replied
the
engineer
you
are
right
to
attach
great
importance
to
this
fact
the
unfortunate
man
cannot
be
incurable
and
despair
has
made
him
what
he
is
but
here
he
will
find
his
fellowmen
and
since
there
is
still
a
soul
in
him
this
soul
we
shall
save
the
castaway
of
tabor
island
to
the
great
pity
of
the
engineer
and
the
great
astonishment
of
neb
was
then
brought
from
the
cabin
which
he
occupied
in
the
fore
part
of
the
bonadventure
when
once
on
land
he
manifested
a
wish
to
run
away
but
cyrus
harding
approaching
placed
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
with
a
gesture
full
of
authority
and
looked
at
him
with
infinite
tenderness
immediately
the
unhappy
man
submitting
to
a
superior
will
gradually
became
calm
his
eyes
fell
his
head
bent
and
he
made
no
more
resistance
poor
fellow
murmured
the
engineer
cyrus
harding
had
attentively
observed
him
to
judge
by
his
appearance
this
miserable
being
had
no
longer
anything
human
about
him
and
yet
harding
as
had
the
reporter
already
observed
in
his
look
an
indefinable
trace
of
intelligence
it
was
decided
that
the
castaway
or
rather
the
stranger
as
he
was
thenceforth
termed
by
his
companions
should
live
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
granite
house
from
which
however
he
could
not
escape
he
was
led
there
without
difficulty
and
with
careful
attention
it
might
perhaps
be
hoped
that
some
day
he
would
be
a
companion
to
the
settlers
in
lincoln
island
cyrus
harding
during
breakfast
which
neb
had
hastened
to
prepare
as
the
reporter
herbert
and
pencroft
were
dying
of
hunger
heard
in
detail
all
the
incidents
which
had
marked
the
voyage
of
exploration
to
the
islet
he
agreed
with
his
friends
on
this
point
that
the
stranger
must
be
either
english
or
american
the
name
britannia
leading
them
to
suppose
this
and
besides
through
the
bushy
beard
and
under
the
shaggy
matted
hair
the
engineer
thought
he
could
recognize
the
characteristic
features
of
the
anglosaxon
but
by
the
bye
said
gideon
spilett
addressing
herbert
you
never
told
us
how
you
met
this
savage
and
we
know
nothing
except
that
you
would
have
been
strangled
if
we
had
not
happened
to
come
up
in
time
to
help
you
upon
my
word
answered
herbert
it
is
rather
difficult
to
say
how
it
happened
i
was
i
think
occupied
in
collecting
my
plants
when
i
heard
a
noise
like
an
avalanche
falling
from
a
very
tall
tree
i
scarcely
had
time
to
look
round
this
unfortunate
man
who
was
without
doubt
concealed
in
a
tree
rushed
upon
me
in
less
time
than
i
take
to
tell
you
about
it
and
unless
mr
spilett
and
pencroft
my
boy
said
cyrus
harding
you
ran
a
great
danger
but
perhaps
without
that
the
poor
creature
would
have
still
hidden
himself
from
your
search
and
we
should
not
have
had
a
new
companion
you
hope
then
cyrus
to
succeed
in
reforming
the
man
asked
the
reporter
yes
replied
the
engineer
breakfast
over
harding
and
his
companions
left
granite
house
and
returned
to
the
beach
they
there
occupied
themselves
in
unloading
the
bonadventure
and
the
engineer
having
examined
the
arms
and
tools
saw
nothing
which
could
help
them
to
establish
the
identity
of
the
stranger
the
capture
of
pigs
made
on
the
islet
was
looked
upon
as
being
very
profitable
to
lincoln
island
and
the
animals
were
led
to
the
sty
where
they
soon
became
at
home
the
two
barrels
containing
the
powder
and
shot
as
well
as
the
box
of
caps
were
very
welcome
it
was
agreed
to
establish
a
small
powdermagazine
either
outside
granite
house
or
in
the
upper
cavern
where
there
would
be
no
fear
of
explosion
however
the
use
of
pyroxyle
was
to
be
continued
for
this
substance
giving
excellent
results
there
was
no
reason
for
substituting
ordinary
powder
when
the
unloading
of
the
vessel
was
finished
captain
said
pencroft
i
think
it
would
be
prudent
to
put
our
bonadventure
in
a
safe
place
is
she
not
safe
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
asked
cyrus
harding
no
captain
replied
the
sailor
half
of
the
time
she
is
stranded
on
the
sand
and
that
works
her
she
is
a
famous
craft
you
see
and
she
behaved
admirably
during
the
squall
which
struck
us
on
our
return
could
she
not
float
in
the
river
no
doubt
captain
she
could
but
there
is
no
shelter
there
and
in
the
east
winds
i
think
that
the
bonadventure
would
suffer
much
from
the
surf
well
where
would
you
put
her
pencroft
in
port
balloon
replied
the
sailor
that
little
creek
shut
in
by
rocks
seems
to
me
to
be
just
the
harbor
we
want
is
it
not
rather
far
pooh
it
is
not
more
than
three
miles
from
granite
house
and
we
have
a
fine
straight
road
to
take
us
there
do
it
then
pencroft
and
take
your
bonadventure
there
replied
the
engineer
and
yet
i
would
rather
have
her
under
our
more
immediate
protection
when
we
have
time
we
must
make
a
little
harbor
for
her
famous
exclaimed
pencroft
a
harbor
with
a
lighthouse
a
pier
and
dock
ah
really
with
you
captain
everything
becomes
easy
yes
my
brave
pencroft
answered
the
engineer
but
on
condition
however
that
you
help
me
for
you
do
as
much
as
three
men
in
all
our
work
herbert
and
the
sailor
then
reembarked
on
board
the
bonadventure
the
anchor
was
weighed
the
sail
hoisted
and
the
wind
drove
her
rapidly
towards
claw
cape
two
hours
after
she
was
reposing
on
the
tranquil
waters
of
port
balloon
during
the
first
days
passed
by
the
stranger
in
granite
house
had
he
already
given
them
reason
to
think
that
his
savage
nature
was
becoming
tamed
did
a
brighter
light
burn
in
the
depths
of
that
obscured
mind
in
short
was
the
soul
returning
to
the
body
yes
to
a
certainty
and
to
such
a
degree
that
cyrus
harding
and
the
reporter
wondered
if
the
reason
of
the
unfortunate
man
had
ever
been
totally
extinguished
at
first
accustomed
to
the
open
air
to
the
unrestrained
liberty
which
he
had
enjoyed
on
tabor
island
the
stranger
manifested
a
sullen
fury
and
it
was
feared
that
he
might
throw
himself
onto
the
beach
out
of
one
of
the
windows
of
granite
house
but
gradually
he
became
calmer
and
more
freedom
was
allowed
to
his
movements
they
had
reason
to
hope
and
to
hope
much
already
forgetting
his
carnivorous
instincts
the
stranger
accepted
a
less
bestial
nourishment
than
that
on
which
he
fed
on
the
islet
and
cooked
meat
did
not
produce
in
him
the
same
sentiment
of
repulsion
which
he
had
showed
on
board
the
bonadventure
cyrus
harding
had
profited
by
a
moment
when
he
was
sleeping
to
cut
his
hair
and
matted
beard
which
formed
a
sort
of
mane
and
gave
him
such
a
savage
aspect
he
had
also
been
clothed
more
suitably
after
having
got
rid
of
the
rag
which
covered
him
the
result
was
that
thanks
to
these
attentions
the
stranger
resumed
a
more
human
appearance
and
it
even
seemed
as
if
his
eyes
had
become
milder
certainly
when
formerly
lighted
up
by
intelligence
this
mans
face
must
have
had
a
sort
of
beauty
every
day
harding
imposed
on
himself
the
task
of
passing
some
hours
in
his
company
he
came
and
worked
near
him
and
occupied
himself
in
different
things
so
as
to
fix
his
attention
a
spark
indeed
would
be
sufficient
to
reillumine
that
soul
a
recollection
crossing
that
brain
to
recall
reason
that
had
been
seen
during
the
storm
on
board
the
bonadventure
the
engineer
did
not
neglect
either
to
speak
aloud
so
as
to
penetrate
at
the
same
time
by
the
organs
of
hearing
and
sight
the
depths
of
that
torpid
intelligence
sometimes
one
of
his
companions
sometimes
another
sometimes
all
joined
him
they
spoke
most
often
of
things
belonging
to
the
navy
which
must
interest
a
sailor
at
times
the
stranger
gave
some
slight
attention
to
what
was
said
and
the
settlers
were
soon
convinced
that
he
partly
understood
them
sometimes
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
deeply
sorrowful
a
proof
that
he
suffered
mentally
for
his
face
could
not
be
mistaken
but
he
did
not
speak
although
at
different
times
however
they
almost
thought
that
words
were
about
to
issue
from
his
lips
at
all
events
the
poor
creature
was
quite
quiet
and
sad
but
was
not
his
calm
only
apparent
was
not
his
sadness
only
the
result
of
his
seclusion
nothing
could
yet
be
ascertained
seeing
only
certain
objects
and
in
a
limited
space
always
in
contact
with
the
colonists
to
whom
he
would
soon
become
accustomed
having
no
desires
to
satisfy
better
fed
better
clothed
it
was
natural
that
his
physical
nature
should
gradually
improve
but
was
he
penetrated
with
the
sense
of
a
new
life
or
rather
to
employ
a
word
which
would
be
exactly
applicable
to
him
was
he
not
becoming
tamed
like
an
animal
in
company
with
his
master
this
was
an
important
question
which
cyrus
harding
was
anxious
to
answer
and
yet
he
did
not
wish
to
treat
his
invalid
roughly
would
he
ever
be
a
convalescent
how
the
engineer
observed
him
every
moment
how
he
was
on
the
watch
for
his
soul
if
one
may
use
the
expression
how
he
was
ready
to
grasp
it
the
settlers
followed
with
real
sympathy
all
the
phases
of
the
cure
undertaken
by
harding
they
aided
him
also
in
this
work
of
humanity
and
all
except
perhaps
the
incredulous
pencroft
soon
shared
both
his
hope
and
his
faith
the
calm
of
the
stranger
was
deep
as
has
been
said
and
he
even
showed
a
sort
of
attachment
for
the
engineer
whose
influence
he
evidently
felt
cyrus
harding
resolved
then
to
try
him
by
transporting
him
to
another
scene
from
that
ocean
which
formerly
his
eyes
had
been
accustomed
to
contemplate
to
the
border
of
the
forest
which
might
perhaps
recall
those
where
so
many
years
of
his
life
had
been
passed
but
said
gideon
spilett
can
we
hope
that
he
will
not
escape
if
once
set
at
liberty
the
experiment
must
be
tried
replied
the
engineer
well
said
pencroft
when
that
fellow
is
outside
and
feels
the
fresh
air
he
will
be
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
can
carry
him
i
do
not
think
so
returned
harding
let
us
try
said
spilett
we
will
try
replied
the
engineer
this
was
on
the
30th
of
october
and
consequently
the
castaway
of
tabor
island
had
been
a
prisoner
in
granite
house
for
nine
days
it
was
warm
and
a
bright
sun
darted
its
rays
on
the
island
cyrus
harding
and
pencroft
went
to
the
room
occupied
by
the
stranger
who
was
found
lying
near
the
window
and
gazing
at
the
sky
come
my
friend
said
the
engineer
to
him
the
stranger
rose
immediately
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
cyrus
harding
and
he
followed
him
while
the
sailor
marched
behind
them
little
confident
as
to
the
result
of
the
experiment
arrived
at
the
door
harding
and
pencroft
made
him
take
his
place
in
the
lift
while
neb
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
waited
for
them
before
granite
house
the
lift
descended
and
in
a
few
moments
all
were
united
on
the
beach
the
settlers
went
a
short
distance
from
the
stranger
so
as
to
leave
him
at
liberty
he
then
made
a
few
steps
toward
the
sea
and
his
look
brightened
with
extreme
animation
but
he
did
not
make
the
slightest
attempt
to
escape
he
was
gazing
at
the
little
waves
which
broken
by
the
islet
rippled
on
the
sand
this
is
only
the
sea
observed
gideon
spilett
and
possibly
it
does
not
inspire
him
with
any
wish
to
escape
yes
replied
harding
we
must
take
him
to
the
plateau
on
the
border
of
the
forest
there
the
experiment
will
be
more
conclusive
besides
he
could
not
run
away
said
neb
since
the
bridge
is
raised
oh
said
pencroft
that
isnt
a
man
to
be
troubled
by
a
stream
like
creek
glycerine
he
could
cross
it
directly
at
a
single
bound
we
shall
soon
see
harding
contented
himself
with
replying
his
eyes
not
quitting
those
of
his
patient
the
latter
was
then
led
towards
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
and
all
climbing
the
left
bank
of
the
river
reached
prospect
heights
arrived
at
the
spot
on
which
grew
the
first
beautiful
trees
of
the
forest
their
foliage
slightly
agitated
by
the
breeze
the
stranger
appeared
greedily
to
drink
in
the
penetrating
odor
which
filled
the
atmosphere
and
a
long
sigh
escaped
from
his
chest
the
settlers
kept
behind
him
ready
to
seize
him
if
he
made
any
movement
to
escape
and
indeed
the
poor
creature
was
on
the
point
of
springing
into
the
creek
which
separated
him
from
the
forest
and
his
legs
were
bent
for
an
instant
as
if
for
a
spring
but
almost
immediately
he
stepped
back
half
sank
down
and
a
large
tear
fell
from
his
eyes
ah
exclaimed
cyrus
harding
you
have
become
a
man
again
for
you
can
weep
chapter
16
yes
the
unfortunate
man
had
wept
some
recollection
doubtless
had
flashed
across
his
brain
and
to
use
cyrus
hardings
expression
by
those
tears
he
was
once
more
a
man
the
colonists
left
him
for
some
time
on
the
plateau
and
withdrew
themselves
to
a
short
distance
so
that
he
might
feel
himself
free
but
he
did
not
think
of
profiting
by
this
liberty
and
harding
soon
brought
him
back
to
granite
house
two
days
after
this
occurrence
the
stranger
appeared
to
wish
gradually
to
mingle
with
their
common
life
he
evidently
heard
and
understood
but
no
less
evidently
was
he
strangely
determined
not
to
speak
to
the
colonists
for
one
evening
pencroft
listening
at
the
door
of
his
room
heard
these
words
escape
from
his
lips
no
here
i
never
the
sailor
reported
these
words
to
his
companions
there
is
some
painful
mystery
there
said
harding
the
stranger
had
begun
to
use
the
laboring
tools
and
he
worked
in
the
garden
when
he
stopped
in
his
work
as
was
often
the
case
he
remained
retired
within
himself
but
on
the
engineers
recommendation
they
respected
the
reserve
which
he
apparently
wished
to
keep
if
one
of
the
settlers
approached
him
he
drew
back
and
his
chest
heaved
with
sobs
as
if
overburdened
was
it
remorse
that
overwhelmed
him
thus
they
were
compelled
to
believe
so
and
gideon
spilett
could
not
help
one
day
making
this
observation
if
he
does
not
speak
it
is
because
he
has
i
fear
things
too
serious
to
be
told
they
must
be
patient
and
wait
a
few
days
later
on
the
3rd
of
november
the
stranger
working
on
the
plateau
had
stopped
letting
his
spade
drop
to
the
ground
and
harding
who
was
observing
him
from
a
little
distance
saw
that
tears
were
again
flowing
from
his
eyes
a
sort
of
irresistible
pity
led
him
towards
the
unfortunate
man
and
he
touched
his
arm
lightly
my
friend
said
he
the
stranger
tried
to
avoid
his
look
and
cyrus
harding
having
endeavored
to
take
his
hand
he
drew
back
quickly
my
friend
said
harding
in
a
firmer
voice
look
at
me
i
wish
it
the
stranger
looked
at
the
engineer
and
seemed
to
be
under
his
power
as
a
subject
under
the
influence
of
a
mesmerist
he
wished
to
run
away
but
then
his
countenance
suddenly
underwent
a
transformation
his
eyes
flashed
words
struggled
to
escape
from
his
lips
he
could
no
longer
contain
himself
at
last
he
folded
his
arms
then
in
a
hollow
voicewho
are
you
he
asked
cyrus
harding
castaways
like
you
replied
the
engineer
whose
emotion
was
deep
we
have
brought
you
here
among
your
fellowmen
my
fellowmen
i
have
none
you
are
in
the
midst
of
friends
friendsfor
me
friends
exclaimed
the
stranger
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
noneverleave
me
leave
me
then
he
rushed
to
the
side
of
the
plateau
which
overlooked
the
sea
and
remained
there
a
long
time
motionless
harding
rejoined
his
companions
and
related
to
them
what
had
just
happened
yes
there
is
some
mystery
in
that
mans
life
said
gideon
spilett
and
it
appears
as
if
he
had
only
reentered
society
by
the
path
of
remorse
i
dont
know
what
sort
of
a
man
we
have
brought
here
said
the
sailor
he
has
secrets
which
we
will
respect
interrupted
cyrus
harding
quickly
if
he
has
committed
any
crime
he
has
most
fearfully
expiated
it
and
in
our
eyes
he
is
absolved
for
two
hours
the
stranger
remained
alone
on
the
shore
evidently
under
the
influence
of
recollections
which
recalled
all
his
past
lifea
melancholy
life
doubtlessand
the
colonists
without
losing
sight
of
him
did
not
attempt
to
disturb
his
solitude
however
after
two
hours
appearing
to
have
formed
a
resolution
he
came
to
find
cyrus
harding
his
eyes
were
red
with
the
tears
he
had
shed
but
he
wept
no
longer
his
countenance
expressed
deep
humility
he
appeared
anxious
timorous
ashamed
and
his
eyes
were
constantly
fixed
on
the
ground
sir
said
he
to
harding
your
companions
and
you
are
you
english
no
answered
the
engineer
we
are
americans
ah
said
the
stranger
and
he
murmured
i
prefer
that
and
you
my
friend
asked
the
engineer
english
replied
he
hastily
and
as
if
these
few
words
had
been
difficult
to
say
he
retreated
to
the
beach
where
he
walked
up
and
down
between
the
cascade
and
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
in
a
state
of
extreme
agitation
then
passing
one
moment
close
to
herbert
he
stopped
and
in
a
stifled
voice
what
month
he
asked
december
replied
herbert
what
year
1866
twelve
years
twelve
years
he
exclaimed
then
he
left
him
abruptly
herbert
reported
to
the
colonists
the
questions
and
answers
which
had
been
made
this
unfortunate
man
observed
gideon
spilett
was
no
longer
acquainted
with
either
months
or
years
yes
added
herbert
and
he
had
been
twelve
years
already
on
the
islet
when
we
found
him
there
twelve
years
rejoined
harding
ah
twelve
years
of
solitude
after
a
wicked
life
perhaps
may
well
impair
a
mans
reason
i
am
induced
to
think
said
pencroft
that
this
man
was
not
wrecked
on
tabor
island
but
that
in
consequence
of
some
crime
he
was
left
there
you
must
be
right
pencroft
replied
the
reporter
and
if
it
is
so
it
is
not
impossible
that
those
who
left
him
on
the
island
may
return
to
fetch
him
some
day
and
they
will
no
longer
find
him
said
herbert
but
then
added
pencroft
they
must
return
and
my
friends
said
cyrus
harding
do
not
let
us
discuss
this
question
until
we
know
more
about
it
i
believe
that
the
unhappy
man
has
suffered
that
he
has
severely
expiated
his
faults
whatever
they
may
have
been
and
that
the
wish
to
unburden
himself
stifles
him
do
not
let
us
press
him
to
tell
us
his
history
he
will
tell
it
to
us
doubtless
and
when
we
know
it
we
shall
see
what
course
it
will
be
best
to
follow
he
alone
besides
can
tell
us
if
he
has
more
than
a
hope
a
certainty
of
returning
some
day
to
his
country
but
i
doubt
it
and
why
asked
the
reporter
because
that
in
the
event
of
his
being
sure
of
being
delivered
at
a
certain
time
he
would
have
waited
the
hour
of
his
deliverance
and
would
not
have
thrown
this
document
into
the
sea
no
it
is
more
probable
that
he
was
condemned
to
die
on
that
islet
and
that
he
never
expected
to
see
his
fellowcreatures
again
but
observed
the
sailor
there
is
one
thing
which
i
cannot
explain
what
is
it
if
this
man
had
been
left
for
twelve
years
on
tabor
island
one
may
well
suppose
that
he
had
been
several
years
already
in
the
wild
state
in
which
we
found
him
that
is
probable
replied
cyrus
harding
it
must
then
be
many
years
since
he
wrote
that
document
no
doubt
and
yet
the
document
appears
to
have
been
recently
written
besides
how
do
you
know
that
the
bottle
which
enclosed
the
document
may
not
have
taken
several
years
to
come
from
tabor
island
to
lincoln
island
that
is
not
absolutely
impossible
replied
the
reporter
might
it
not
have
been
a
long
time
already
on
the
coast
of
the
island
no
answered
pencroft
for
it
was
still
floating
we
could
not
even
suppose
that
after
it
had
stayed
for
any
length
of
time
on
the
shore
it
would
have
been
swept
off
by
the
sea
for
the
south
coast
is
all
rocks
and
it
would
certainly
have
been
smashed
to
pieces
there
that
is
true
rejoined
cyrus
harding
thoughtfully
and
then
continued
the
sailor
if
the
document
was
several
years
old
if
it
had
been
shut
up
in
that
bottle
for
several
years
it
would
have
been
injured
by
damp
now
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
and
it
was
found
in
a
perfect
state
of
preservation
the
sailors
reasoning
was
very
just
and
pointed
out
an
incomprehensible
fact
for
the
document
appeared
to
have
been
recently
written
when
the
colonists
found
it
in
the
bottle
moreover
it
gave
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
tabor
island
correctly
which
implied
that
its
author
had
a
more
complete
knowledge
of
hydrography
than
could
be
expected
of
a
common
sailor
there
is
in
this
again
something
unaccountable
said
the
engineer
but
we
will
not
urge
our
companion
to
speak
when
he
likes
my
friends
then
we
shall
be
ready
to
hear
him
during
the
following
days
the
stranger
did
not
speak
a
word
and
did
not
once
leave
the
precincts
of
the
plateau
he
worked
away
without
losing
a
moment
without
taking
a
minutes
rest
but
always
in
a
retired
place
at
meal
times
he
never
came
to
granite
house
although
invited
several
times
to
do
so
but
contented
himself
with
eating
a
few
raw
vegetables
at
nightfall
he
did
not
return
to
the
room
assigned
to
him
but
remained
under
some
clump
of
trees
or
when
the
weather
was
bad
crouched
in
some
cleft
of
the
rocks
thus
he
lived
in
the
same
manner
as
when
he
had
no
other
shelter
than
the
forests
of
tabor
island
and
as
all
persuasion
to
induce
him
to
improve
his
life
was
in
vain
the
colonists
waited
patiently
and
the
time
was
near
when
as
it
seemed
almost
involuntarily
urged
by
his
conscience
a
terrible
confession
escaped
him
on
the
10th
of
november
about
eight
oclock
in
the
evening
as
night
was
coming
on
the
stranger
appeared
unexpectedly
before
the
settlers
who
were
assembled
under
the
veranda
his
eyes
burned
strangely
and
he
had
quite
resumed
the
wild
aspect
of
his
worst
days
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
were
astounded
on
seeing
that
overcome
by
some
terrible
emotion
his
teeth
chattered
like
those
of
a
person
in
a
fever
what
was
the
matter
with
him
was
the
sight
of
his
fellowcreatures
insupportable
to
him
was
he
weary
of
this
return
to
a
civilized
mode
of
existence
was
he
pining
for
his
former
savage
life
it
appeared
so
as
soon
he
was
heard
to
express
himself
in
these
incoherent
sentences
why
am
i
here
by
what
right
have
you
dragged
me
from
my
islet
do
you
think
there
could
be
any
tie
between
you
and
me
do
you
know
who
i
amwhat
i
have
donewhy
i
was
therealone
and
who
told
you
that
i
was
not
abandoned
therethat
i
was
not
condemned
to
die
there
do
you
know
my
past
how
do
you
know
that
i
have
not
stolen

i
am
not
a
wretchan
accursed
beingonly
fit
to
live
like
a
wild
beast
far
from
allspeakdo
you
know
it
the
colonists
listened
without
interrupting
the
miserable
creature
from
whom
these
broken
confessions
escaped
as
it
were
in
spite
of
himself
harding
wishing
to
calm
him
approached
him
but
he
hastily
drew
back
no
no
he
exclaimed
one
word
onlyam
i
free
you
are
free
answered
the
engineer
farewell
then
he
cried
and
fled
like
a
madman
neb
pencroft
and
herbert
ran
also
towards
the
edge
of
the
woodbut
they
returned
alone
we
must
let
him
alone
said
cyrus
harding
he
will
never
come
back
exclaimed
pencroft
he
will
come
back
replied
the
engineer
many
days
passed
but
hardingwas
it
a
sort
of
presentimentpersisted
in
the
fixed
idea
that
sooner
or
later
the
unhappy
man
would
return
it
is
the
last
revolt
of
his
wild
nature
said
he
which
remorse
has
touched
and
which
renewed
solitude
will
terrify
in
the
meanwhile
works
of
all
sorts
were
continued
as
well
on
prospect
heights
as
at
the
corral
where
harding
intended
to
build
a
farm
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
the
seeds
collected
by
herbert
on
tabor
island
had
been
carefully
sown
the
plateau
thus
formed
one
immense
kitchengarden
well
laid
out
and
carefully
tended
so
that
the
arms
of
the
settlers
were
never
in
want
of
work
there
was
always
something
to
be
done
as
the
esculents
increased
in
number
it
became
necessary
to
enlarge
the
simple
beds
which
threatened
to
grow
into
regular
fields
and
replace
the
meadows
but
grass
abounded
in
other
parts
of
the
island
and
there
was
no
fear
of
the
onagers
being
obliged
to
go
on
short
allowance
it
was
well
worth
while
besides
to
turn
prospect
heights
into
a
kitchengarden
defended
by
its
deep
belt
of
creeks
and
to
remove
them
to
the
meadows
which
had
no
need
of
protection
against
the
depredations
of
quadrumana
and
quadrapeds
on
the
15th
of
november
the
third
harvest
was
gathered
in
how
wonderfully
had
the
field
increased
in
extent
since
eighteen
months
ago
when
the
first
grain
of
wheat
was
sown
the
second
crop
of
six
hundred
thousand
grains
produced
this
time
four
thousand
bushels
or
five
hundred
millions
of
grains
the
colony
was
rich
in
corn
for
ten
bushels
alone
were
sufficient
for
sowing
every
year
to
produce
an
ample
crop
for
the
food
both
of
men
and
beasts
the
harvest
was
completed
and
the
last
fortnight
of
the
month
of
november
was
devoted
to
the
work
of
converting
it
into
food
for
man
in
fact
they
had
corn
but
not
flour
and
the
establishment
of
a
mill
was
necessary
cyrus
harding
could
have
utilized
the
second
fall
which
flowed
into
the
mercy
to
establish
his
motive
power
the
first
being
already
occupied
with
moving
the
felting
mill
but
after
some
consultation
it
was
decided
that
a
simple
windmill
should
be
built
on
prospect
heights
the
building
of
this
presented
no
more
difficulty
than
the
building
of
the
former
and
it
was
moreover
certain
that
there
would
be
no
want
of
wind
on
the
plateau
exposed
as
it
was
to
the
sea
breezes
not
to
mention
said
pencroft
that
the
windmill
will
be
more
lively
and
will
have
a
good
effect
in
the
landscape
they
set
to
work
by
choosing
timber
for
the
frame
and
machinery
of
the
mill
some
large
stones
found
at
the
north
of
the
lake
could
be
easily
transformed
into
millstones
and
as
to
the
sails
the
inexhaustible
case
of
the
balloon
furnished
the
necessary
material
cyrus
harding
made
his
model
and
the
site
of
the
mill
was
chosen
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
poultryyard
near
the
shore
of
the
lake
the
frame
was
to
rest
on
a
pivot
supported
with
strong
timbers
so
that
it
could
turn
with
all
the
machinery
it
contained
according
as
the
wind
required
it
the
work
advanced
rapidly
neb
and
pencroft
had
become
very
skilful
carpenters
and
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
copy
the
models
provided
by
the
engineer
soon
a
sort
of
cylindrical
box
in
shape
like
a
pepperpot
with
a
pointed
roof
rose
on
the
spot
chosen
the
four
frames
which
formed
the
sails
had
been
firmly
fixed
in
the
center
beam
so
as
to
form
a
certain
angle
with
it
and
secured
with
iron
clamps
as
to
the
different
parts
of
the
internal
mechanism
the
box
destined
to
contain
the
two
millstones
the
fixed
stone
and
the
moving
stone
the
hopper
a
sort
of
large
square
trough
wide
at
the
top
narrow
at
the
bottom
which
would
allow
the
grain
to
fall
on
the
stones
the
oscillating
spout
intended
to
regulate
the
passing
of
the
grain
and
lastly
the
bolting
machine
which
by
the
operation
of
sifting
separates
the
bran
from
the
flour
were
made
without
difficulty
the
tools
were
good
and
the
work
not
difficult
for
in
reality
the
machinery
of
a
mill
is
very
simple
this
was
only
a
question
of
time
every
one
had
worked
at
the
construction
of
the
mill
and
on
the
1st
of
december
it
was
finished
as
usual
pencroft
was
delighted
with
his
work
and
had
no
doubt
that
the
apparatus
was
perfect
now
for
a
good
wind
said
he
and
we
shall
grind
our
first
harvest
splendidly
a
good
wind
certainly
answered
the
engineer
but
not
too
much
pencroft
pooh
our
mill
would
only
go
the
faster
there
is
no
need
for
it
to
go
so
very
fast
replied
cyrus
harding
it
is
known
by
experience
that
the
greatest
quantity
of
work
is
performed
by
a
mill
when
the
number
of
turns
made
by
the
sails
in
a
minute
is
six
times
the
number
of
feet
traversed
by
the
wind
in
a
second
a
moderate
breeze
which
passes
over
twentyfour
feet
to
the
second
will
give
sixteen
turns
to
the
sails
during
a
minute
and
there
is
no
need
of
more
exactly
cried
herbert
a
fine
breeze
is
blowing
from
the
northeast
which
will
soon
do
our
business
for
us
there
was
no
reason
for
delaying
the
inauguration
of
the
mill
for
the
settlers
were
eager
to
taste
the
first
piece
of
bread
in
lincoln
island
on
this
morning
two
or
three
bushels
of
wheat
were
ground
and
the
next
day
at
breakfast
a
magnificent
loaf
a
little
heavy
perhaps
although
raised
with
yeast
appeared
on
the
table
at
granite
house
every
one
munched
away
at
it
with
a
pleasure
which
may
be
easily
understood
in
the
meanwhile
the
stranger
had
not
reappeared
several
times
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
searched
the
forest
in
the
neighborhood
of
granite
house
without
meeting
or
finding
any
trace
of
him
they
became
seriously
uneasy
at
this
prolonged
absence
certainly
the
former
savage
of
tabor
island
could
not
be
perplexed
how
to
live
in
the
forest
abounding
in
game
but
was
it
not
to
be
feared
that
he
had
resumed
his
habits
and
that
this
freedom
would
revive
in
him
his
wild
instincts
however
harding
by
a
sort
of
presentiment
doubtless
always
persisted
in
saying
that
the
fugitive
would
return
yes
he
will
return
he
repeated
with
a
confidence
which
his
companions
could
not
share
when
this
unfortunate
man
was
on
tabor
island
he
knew
himself
to
be
alone
here
he
knows
that
fellowmen
are
awaiting
him
since
he
has
partially
spoken
of
his
past
life
the
poor
penitent
will
return
to
tell
the
whole
and
from
that
day
he
will
belong
to
us
the
event
justified
cyrus
hardings
predictions
on
the
3rd
of
december
herbert
had
left
the
plateau
to
go
and
fish
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
lake
he
was
unarmed
and
till
then
had
never
taken
any
precautions
for
defense
as
dangerous
animals
had
not
shown
themselves
on
that
part
of
the
island
meanwhile
pencroft
and
neb
were
working
in
the
poultryyard
while
harding
and
the
reporter
were
occupied
at
the
chimneys
in
making
soda
the
store
of
soap
being
exhausted
suddenly
cries
resounded
help
help
cyrus
harding
and
the
reporter
being
at
too
great
a
distance
had
not
been
able
to
hear
the
shouts
pencroft
and
neb
leaving
the
poultryyard
in
all
haste
rushed
towards
the
lake
but
before
then
the
stranger
whose
presence
at
this
place
no
one
had
suspected
crossed
creek
glycerine
which
separated
the
plateau
from
the
forest
and
bounded
up
the
opposite
bank
herbert
was
there
face
to
face
with
a
fierce
jaguar
similar
to
the
one
which
had
been
killed
on
reptile
end
suddenly
surprised
he
was
standing
with
his
back
against
a
tree
while
the
animal
gathering
itself
together
was
about
to
spring
but
the
stranger
with
no
other
weapon
than
a
knife
rushed
on
the
formidable
animal
who
turned
to
meet
this
new
adversary
the
struggle
was
short
the
stranger
possessed
immense
strength
and
activity
he
seized
the
jaguars
throat
with
one
powerful
hand
holding
it
as
in
a
vise
without
heeding
the
beasts
claws
which
tore
his
flesh
and
with
the
other
he
plunged
his
knife
into
its
heart
the
jaguar
fell
the
stranger
kicked
away
the
body
and
was
about
to
fly
at
the
moment
when
the
settlers
arrived
on
the
field
of
battle
but
herbert
clinging
to
him
cried
no
no
you
shall
not
go
harding
advanced
towards
the
stranger
who
frowned
when
he
saw
him
approaching
the
blood
flowed
from
his
shoulder
under
his
torn
shirt
but
he
took
no
notice
of
it
my
friend
said
cyrus
harding
we
have
just
contracted
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
you
to
save
our
boy
you
have
risked
your
life
my
life
murmured
the
stranger
what
is
that
worth
less
than
nothing
you
are
wounded
it
is
no
matter
will
you
give
me
your
hand
and
as
herbert
endeavored
to
seize
the
hand
which
had
just
saved
him
the
stranger
folded
his
arms
his
chest
heaved
his
look
darkened
and
he
appeared
to
wish
to
escape
but
making
a
violent
effort
over
himself
and
in
an
abrupt
tone
who
are
you
he
asked
and
what
do
you
claim
to
be
to
me
it
was
the
colonists
history
which
he
thus
demanded
and
for
the
first
time
perhaps
this
history
recounted
he
would
tell
his
own
in
a
few
words
harding
related
all
that
had
happened
since
their
departure
from
richmond
how
they
had
managed
and
what
resources
they
now
had
at
their
disposal
the
stranger
listened
with
extreme
attention
then
the
engineer
told
who
they
all
were
gideon
spilett
herbert
pencroft
neb
himself
and
he
added
that
the
greatest
happiness
they
had
felt
since
their
arrival
in
lincoln
island
was
on
the
return
of
the
vessel
from
tabor
island
when
they
had
been
able
to
include
among
them
a
new
companion
at
these
words
the
strangers
face
flushed
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
and
confusion
was
depicted
on
his
countenance
and
now
that
you
know
us
added
cyrus
harding
will
you
give
us
your
hand
no
replied
the
stranger
in
a
hoarse
voice
no
you
are
honest
men
and
i
chapter
17
these
last
words
justified
the
colonists
presentiment
there
had
been
some
mournful
past
perhaps
expiated
in
the
sight
of
men
but
from
which
his
conscience
had
not
yet
absolved
him
at
any
rate
the
guilty
man
felt
remorse
he
repented
and
his
new
friends
would
have
cordially
pressed
the
hand
which
they
sought
but
he
did
not
feel
himself
worthy
to
extend
it
to
honest
men
however
after
the
scene
with
the
jaguar
he
did
not
return
to
the
forest
and
from
that
day
did
not
go
beyond
the
enclosure
of
granite
house
what
was
the
mystery
of
his
life
would
the
stranger
one
day
speak
of
it
time
alone
could
show
at
any
rate
it
was
agreed
that
his
secret
should
never
be
asked
from
him
and
that
they
would
live
with
him
as
if
they
suspected
nothing
for
some
days
their
life
continued
as
before
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
worked
together
sometimes
chemists
sometimes
experimentalists
the
reporter
never
left
the
engineer
except
to
hunt
with
herbert
for
it
would
not
have
been
prudent
to
allow
the
lad
to
ramble
alone
in
the
forest
and
it
was
very
necessary
to
be
on
their
guard
as
to
neb
and
pencroft
one
day
at
the
stables
and
poultryyard
another
at
the
corral
without
reckoning
work
in
granite
house
they
were
never
in
want
of
employment
the
stranger
worked
alone
and
he
had
resumed
his
usual
life
never
appearing
at
meals
sleeping
under
the
trees
in
the
plateau
never
mingling
with
his
companions
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
society
of
those
who
had
saved
him
was
insupportable
to
him
but
then
observed
pencroft
why
did
he
entreat
the
help
of
his
fellowcreatures
why
did
he
throw
that
paper
into
the
sea
he
will
tell
us
why
invariably
replied
cyrus
harding
when
perhaps
sooner
than
you
think
pencroft
and
indeed
the
day
of
confession
was
near
on
the
10th
of
december
a
week
after
his
return
to
granite
house
harding
saw
the
stranger
approaching
who
in
a
calm
voice
and
humble
tone
said
to
him
sir
i
have
a
request
to
make
of
you
speak
answered
the
engineer
but
first
let
me
ask
you
a
question
at
these
words
the
stranger
reddened
and
was
on
the
point
of
withdrawing
cyrus
harding
understood
what
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
the
guilty
man
who
doubtless
feared
that
the
engineer
would
interrogate
him
on
his
past
life
harding
held
him
back
comrade
said
he
we
are
not
only
your
companions
but
your
friends
i
wish
you
to
believe
that
and
now
i
will
listen
to
you
the
stranger
pressed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
he
was
seized
with
a
sort
of
trembling
and
remained
a
few
moments
without
being
able
to
articulate
a
word
sir
said
he
at
last
i
have
come
to
beg
you
to
grant
me
a
favor
what
is
it
you
have
four
or
five
miles
from
here
a
corral
for
your
domesticated
animals
these
animals
need
to
be
taken
care
of
will
you
allow
me
to
live
there
with
them
cyrus
harding
gazed
at
the
unfortunate
man
for
a
few
moments
with
a
feeling
of
deep
commiseration
then
my
friend
said
he
the
corral
has
only
stables
hardly
fit
for
animals
it
will
be
good
enough
for
me
sir
my
friend
answered
harding
we
will
not
constrain
you
in
anything
you
wish
to
live
at
the
corral
so
be
it
you
will
however
be
always
welcome
at
granite
house
but
since
you
wish
to
live
at
the
corral
we
will
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
your
being
comfortably
established
there
never
mind
that
i
shall
do
very
well
my
friend
answered
harding
who
always
intentionally
made
use
of
this
cordial
appellation
you
must
let
us
judge
what
it
will
be
best
to
do
in
this
respect
thank
you
sir
replied
the
stranger
as
he
withdrew
the
engineer
then
made
known
to
his
companions
the
proposal
which
had
been
made
to
him
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
build
a
wooden
house
at
the
corral
which
they
would
make
as
comfortable
as
possible
that
very
day
the
colonists
repaired
to
the
corral
with
the
necessary
tools
and
a
week
had
not
passed
before
the
house
was
ready
to
receive
its
tenant
it
was
built
about
twenty
feet
from
the
sheds
and
from
there
it
was
easy
to
overlook
the
flock
of
sheep
which
then
numbered
more
than
eighty
some
furniture
a
bed
table
bench
cupboard
and
chest
were
manufactured
and
a
gun
ammunition
and
tools
were
carried
to
the
corral
the
stranger
however
had
seen
nothing
of
his
new
dwelling
and
he
had
allowed
the
settlers
to
work
there
without
him
while
he
occupied
himself
on
the
plateau
wishing
doubtless
to
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
his
work
indeed
thanks
to
him
all
the
ground
was
dug
up
and
ready
to
be
sowed
when
the
time
came
it
was
on
the
20th
of
december
that
all
the
arrangements
at
the
corral
were
completed
the
engineer
announced
to
the
stranger
that
his
dwelling
was
ready
to
receive
him
and
the
latter
replied
that
he
would
go
and
sleep
there
that
very
evening
on
this
evening
the
colonists
were
gathered
in
the
diningroom
of
granite
house
it
was
then
eight
oclock
the
hour
at
which
their
companion
was
to
leave
them
not
wishing
to
trouble
him
by
their
presence
and
thus
imposing
on
him
the
necessity
of
saying
farewells
which
might
perhaps
be
painful
to
him
they
had
left
him
alone
and
ascended
to
granite
house
now
they
had
been
talking
in
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
when
a
light
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
almost
immediately
the
stranger
entered
and
without
any
preamble
gentlemen
said
he
before
i
leave
you
it
is
right
that
you
should
know
my
history
i
will
tell
it
you
these
simple
words
profoundly
impressed
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
the
engineer
rose
we
ask
you
nothing
my
friend
said
he
it
is
your
right
to
be
silent
it
is
my
duty
to
speak
sit
down
then
no
i
will
stand
we
are
ready
to
hear
you
replied
harding
the
stranger
remained
standing
in
a
corner
of
the
room
a
little
in
the
shade
he
was
bareheaded
his
arms
folded
across
his
chest
and
it
was
in
this
posture
that
in
a
hoarse
voice
speaking
like
some
one
who
obliges
himself
to
speak
he
gave
the
following
recital
which
his
auditors
did
not
once
interrupt
on
the
20th
of
december
1854
a
steamyacht
belonging
to
a
scotch
nobleman
lord
glenarvan
anchored
off
cape
bernouilli
on
the
western
coast
of
australia
in
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
on
board
this
yacht
were
lord
glenarvan
and
his
wife
a
major
in
the
english
army
a
french
geographer
a
young
girl
and
a
young
boy
these
two
last
were
the
children
of
captain
grant
whose
ship
the
britannia
had
been
lost
crew
and
cargo
a
year
before
the
duncan
was
commanded
by
captain
john
mangles
and
manned
by
a
crew
of
fifteen
men
this
is
the
reason
the
yacht
at
this
time
lay
off
the
coast
of
australia
six
months
before
a
bottle
enclosing
a
document
written
in
english
german
and
french
had
been
found
in
the
irish
sea
and
picked
up
by
the
duncan
this
document
stated
in
substance
that
there
still
existed
three
survivors
from
the
wreck
of
the
britannia
that
these
survivors
were
captain
grant
and
two
of
his
men
and
that
they
had
found
refuge
on
some
land
of
which
the
document
gave
the
latitude
but
of
which
the
longitude
effaced
by
the
sea
was
no
longer
legible
this
latitude
was
37deg
11
south
therefore
the
longitude
being
unknown
if
they
followed
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
over
continents
and
seas
they
would
be
certain
to
reach
the
spot
inhabited
by
captain
grant
and
his
two
companions
the
english
admiralty
having
hesitated
to
undertake
this
search
lord
glenarvan
resolved
to
attempt
everything
to
find
the
captain
he
communicated
with
mary
and
robert
grant
who
joined
him
the
duncan
yacht
was
equipped
for
the
distant
voyage
in
which
the
noblemans
family
and
the
captains
children
wished
to
take
part
and
the
duncan
leaving
glasgow
proceeded
towards
the
atlantic
passed
through
the
straits
of
magellan
and
ascended
the
pacific
as
far
as
patagonia
where
according
to
a
previous
interpretation
of
the
document
they
supposed
that
captain
grant
was
a
prisoner
among
the
indians
the
duncan
disembarked
her
passengers
on
the
western
coast
of
patagonia
and
sailed
to
pick
them
up
again
on
the
eastern
coast
at
cape
corrientes
lord
glenarvan
traversed
patagonia
following
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
and
having
found
no
trace
of
the
captain
he
reembarked
on
the
13th
of
november
so
as
to
pursue
his
search
through
the
ocean
after
having
unsuccessfully
visited
the
islands
of
tristan
dacunha
and
amsterdam
situated
in
her
course
the
duncan
as
i
have
said
arrived
at
cape
bernouilli
on
the
australian
coast
on
the
20th
of
december
1854
it
was
lord
glenarvans
intention
to
traverse
australia
as
he
had
traversed
america
and
he
disembarked
a
few
miles
from
the
coast
was
established
a
farm
belonging
to
an
irishman
who
offered
hospitality
to
the
travelers
lord
glenarvan
made
known
to
the
irishman
the
cause
which
had
brought
him
to
these
parts
and
asked
if
he
knew
whether
a
threemasted
english
vessel
the
britannia
had
been
lost
less
than
two
years
before
on
the
west
coast
of
australia
the
irishman
had
never
heard
of
this
wreck
but
to
the
great
surprise
of
the
bystanders
one
of
his
servants
came
forward
and
said
my
lord
praise
and
thank
god
if
captain
grant
is
still
living
he
is
living
on
the
australian
shores
who
are
you
asked
lord
glenarvan
a
scotchman
like
yourself
my
lord
replied
the
man
i
am
one
of
captain
grants
crewone
of
the
castaways
of
the
britannia
this
man
was
called
ayrton
he
was
in
fact
the
boatswains
mate
of
the
britannia
as
his
papers
showed
but
separated
from
captain
grant
at
the
moment
when
the
ship
struck
upon
the
rocks
he
had
till
then
believed
that
the
captain
with
all
his
crew
had
perished
and
that
he
ayrton
was
the
sole
survivor
of
the
britannia
only
he
added
it
was
not
on
the
west
coast
but
on
the
east
coast
of
australia
that
the
vessel
was
lost
and
if
captain
grant
is
still
living
as
his
document
indicates
he
is
a
prisoner
among
the
natives
and
it
is
on
the
other
coast
that
he
must
be
looked
for
this
man
spoke
in
a
frank
voice
and
with
a
confident
look
his
words
could
not
be
doubted
the
irishman
in
whose
service
he
had
been
for
more
than
a
year
answered
for
his
trustworthiness
lord
glenarvan
therefore
believed
in
the
fidelity
of
this
man
and
by
his
advice
resolved
to
cross
australia
following
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
lord
glenarvan
his
wife
the
two
children
the
major
the
frenchman
captain
mangles
and
a
few
sailors
composed
the
little
band
under
the
command
of
ayrton
while
the
duncan
under
charge
of
the
mate
tom
austin
proceeded
to
melbourne
there
to
await
lord
glenarvans
instructions
they
set
out
on
the
23rd
of
december
1854
it
is
time
to
say
that
ayrton
was
a
traitor
he
was
indeed
the
boatswains
mate
of
the
britannia
but
after
some
dispute
with
his
captain
he
endeavored
to
incite
the
crew
to
mutiny
and
seize
the
ship
and
captain
grant
had
landed
him
on
the
8th
of
april
1852
on
the
west
coast
of
australia
and
then
sailed
leaving
him
there
as
was
only
just
therefore
this
wretched
man
knew
nothing
of
the
wreck
of
the
britannia
he
had
just
heard
of
it
from
glenarvans
account
since
his
abandonment
he
had
become
under
the
name
of
ben
joyce
the
leader
of
the
escaped
convicts
and
if
he
boldly
maintained
that
the
wreck
had
taken
place
on
the
east
coast
and
led
lord
glenarvan
to
proceed
in
that
direction
it
was
that
he
hoped
to
separate
him
from
his
ship
seize
the
duncan
and
make
the
yacht
a
pirate
in
the
pacific
here
the
stranger
stopped
for
a
moment
his
voice
trembled
but
he
continued
the
expedition
set
out
and
proceeded
across
australia
it
was
inevitably
unfortunate
since
ayrton
or
ben
joyce
as
he
may
be
called
guided
it
sometimes
preceded
sometimes
followed
by
his
band
of
convicts
who
had
been
told
what
they
had
to
do
meanwhile
the
duncan
had
been
sent
to
melbourne
for
repairs
it
was
necessary
then
to
get
lord
glenarvan
to
order
her
to
leave
melbourne
and
go
to
the
east
coast
of
australia
where
it
would
be
easy
to
seize
her
after
having
led
the
expedition
near
enough
to
the
coast
in
the
midst
of
vast
forests
with
no
resources
ayrton
obtained
a
letter
which
he
was
charged
to
carry
to
the
mate
of
the
duncana
letter
which
ordered
the
yacht
to
repair
immediately
to
the
east
coast
to
twofold
bay
that
is
to
say
a
few
days
journey
from
the
place
where
the
expedition
had
stopped
it
was
there
that
ayrton
had
agreed
to
meet
his
accomplices
and
two
days
after
gaining
possession
of
the
letter
he
arrived
at
melbourne
so
far
the
villain
had
succeeded
in
his
wicked
design
he
would
be
able
to
take
the
duncan
into
twofold
bay
where
it
would
be
easy
for
the
convicts
to
seize
her
and
her
crew
massacred
ben
joyce
would
become
master
of
the
seas
but
it
pleased
god
to
prevent
the
accomplishment
of
these
terrible
projects
ayrton
arrived
at
melbourne
delivered
the
letter
to
the
mate
tom
austin
who
read
it
and
immediately
set
sail
but
judge
of
ayrtons
rage
and
disappointment
when
the
next
day
he
found
that
the
mate
was
taking
the
vessel
not
to
the
east
coast
of
australia
to
twofold
bay
but
to
the
east
coast
of
new
zealand
he
wished
to
stop
him
but
austin
showed
him
the
letter
and
indeed
by
a
providential
error
of
the
french
geographer
who
had
written
the
letter
the
east
coast
of
new
zealand
was
mentioned
as
the
place
of
destination
all
ayrtons
plans
were
frustrated
he
became
outrageous
they
put
him
in
irons
he
was
then
taken
to
the
coast
of
new
zealand
not
knowing
what
would
become
of
his
accomplices
or
what
would
become
of
lord
glenarvan
the
duncan
cruised
about
on
this
coast
until
the
3rd
of
march
on
that
day
ayrton
heard
the
report
of
guns
the
guns
on
the
duncan
were
being
fired
and
soon
lord
glenarvan
and
his
companions
came
on
board
this
is
what
had
happened
after
a
thousand
hardships
a
thousand
dangers
lord
glenarvan
had
accomplished
his
journey
and
arrived
on
the
east
coast
of
australia
at
twofold
bay
no
duncan
he
telegraphed
to
melbourne
they
answered
duncan
sailed
on
the
18th
instant
destination
unknown
lord
glenarvan
could
only
arrive
at
one
conclusion
that
his
honest
yacht
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
ben
joyce
and
had
become
a
pirate
vessel
however
lord
glenarvan
would
not
give
up
he
was
a
bold
and
generous
man
he
embarked
in
a
merchant
vessel
sailed
to
the
west
coast
of
new
zealand
traversed
it
along
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
without
finding
any
trace
of
captain
grant
but
on
the
other
side
to
his
great
surprise
and
by
the
will
of
heaven
he
found
the
duncan
under
command
of
the
mate
who
had
been
waiting
for
him
for
five
weeks
this
was
on
the
3rd
of
march
1855
lord
glenarvan
was
now
on
board
the
duncan
but
ayrton
was
there
also
he
appeared
before
the
nobleman
who
wished
to
extract
from
him
all
that
the
villain
knew
about
captain
grant
ayrton
refused
to
speak
lord
glenarvan
then
told
him
that
at
the
first
port
they
put
into
he
would
be
delivered
up
to
the
english
authorities
ayrton
remained
mute
the
duncan
continued
her
voyage
along
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
in
the
meanwhile
lady
glenarvan
undertook
to
vanquish
the
resistance
of
the
ruffian
at
last
her
influence
prevailed
and
ayrton
in
exchange
for
what
he
could
tell
proposed
that
lord
glenarvan
should
leave
him
on
some
island
in
the
pacific
instead
of
giving
him
up
to
the
english
authorities
lord
glenarvan
resolving
to
do
anything
to
obtain
information
about
captain
grant
consented
ayrton
then
related
all
his
life
and
it
was
certain
that
he
knew
nothing
from
the
day
on
which
captain
grant
had
landed
him
on
the
australian
coast
nevertheless
lord
glenarvan
kept
the
promise
which
he
had
given
the
duncan
continued
her
voyage
and
arrived
at
tabor
island
it
was
there
that
ayrton
was
to
be
landed
and
it
was
there
also
that
by
a
veritable
miracle
they
found
captain
grant
and
two
men
exactly
on
the
thirtyseventh
parallel
the
convict
then
went
to
take
their
place
on
this
desert
islet
and
at
the
moment
he
left
the
yacht
these
words
were
pronounced
by
lord
glenarvan
here
ayrton
you
will
be
far
from
any
land
and
without
any
possible
communication
with
your
fellowcreatures
you
cannot
escape
from
this
islet
on
which
the
duncan
leaves
you
you
will
be
alone
under
the
eye
of
a
god
who
reads
the
depths
of
the
heart
but
you
will
be
neither
lost
nor
forgotten
as
was
captain
grant
unworthy
as
you
are
to
be
remembered
by
men
men
will
remember
you
i
know
where
you
are
ayrton
and
i
know
where
to
find
you
i
will
never
forget
it
and
the
duncan
making
sail
soon
disappeared
this
was
18th
of
march
1855
the
events
which
have
just
been
briefly
related
are
taken
from
a
work
which
some
of
our
readers
have
no
doubt
read
and
which
is
entitled
captain
grants
children
they
will
remark
on
this
occasion
as
well
as
later
some
discrepancy
in
the
dates
but
later
again
they
will
understand
why
the
real
dates
were
not
at
first
given
ayrton
was
alone
but
he
had
no
want
of
either
ammunition
weapons
tools
or
seeds
at
his
the
convicts
disposal
was
the
house
built
by
honest
captain
grant
he
had
only
to
live
and
expiate
in
solitude
the
crimes
which
he
had
committed
gentlemen
he
repented
he
was
ashamed
of
his
crimes
and
was
very
miserable
he
said
to
himself
that
if
men
came
some
day
to
take
him
from
that
islet
he
must
be
worthy
to
return
among
them
how
he
suffered
that
wretched
man
how
he
labored
to
recover
himself
by
work
how
he
prayed
to
be
reformed
by
prayer
for
two
years
three
years
this
went
on
but
ayrton
humbled
by
solitude
always
looking
for
some
ship
to
appear
on
the
horizon
asking
himself
if
the
time
of
expiation
would
soon
be
complete
suffered
as
none
other
suffered
oh
how
dreadful
was
this
solitude
to
a
heart
tormented
by
remorse
but
doubtless
heaven
had
not
sufficiently
punished
this
unhappy
man
for
he
felt
that
he
was
gradually
becoming
a
savage
he
felt
that
brutishness
was
gradually
gaining
on
him
he
could
not
say
if
it
was
after
two
or
three
years
of
solitude
but
at
last
he
became
the
miserable
creature
you
found
i
have
no
need
to
tell
you
gentlemen
that
ayrton
ben
joyce
and
i
are
the
same
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
rose
at
the
end
of
this
account
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
much
they
were
moved
what
misery
grief
and
despair
lay
revealed
before
them
ayrton
said
harding
rising
you
have
been
a
great
criminal
but
heaven
must
certainly
think
that
you
have
expiated
your
crimes
that
has
been
proved
by
your
having
been
brought
again
among
your
fellowcreatures
ayrton
you
are
forgiven
and
now
you
will
be
our
companion
ayrton
drew
back
here
is
my
hand
said
the
engineer
ayrton
grasped
the
hand
which
harding
extended
to
him
and
great
tears
fell
from
his
eyes
will
you
live
with
us
asked
cyrus
harding
captain
harding
leave
me
some
time
longer
replied
ayrton
leave
me
alone
in
the
hut
in
the
corral
as
you
like
ayrton
answered
cyrus
harding
ayrton
was
going
to
withdraw
when
the
engineer
addressed
one
more
question
to
him
one
word
more
my
friend
since
it
was
your
intention
to
live
alone
why
did
you
throw
into
the
sea
the
document
which
put
us
on
your
track
a
document
repeated
ayrton
who
did
not
appear
to
know
what
he
meant
yes
the
document
which
we
found
enclosed
in
a
bottle
giving
us
the
exact
position
of
tabor
island
ayrton
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
then
after
having
thought
i
never
threw
any
document
into
the
sea
he
answered
never
exclaimed
pencroft
never
and
ayrton
bowing
reached
the
door
and
departed
chapter
18
poor
man
said
herbert
who
had
rushed
to
the
door
but
returned
having
seen
ayrton
slide
down
the
rope
on
the
lift
and
disappear
in
the
darkness
he
will
come
back
said
cyrus
harding
come
now
captain
exclaimed
pencroft
what
does
that
mean
what
wasnt
it
ayrton
who
threw
that
bottle
into
the
sea
who
was
it
then
certainly
if
ever
a
question
was
necessary
to
be
made
it
was
that
one
it
was
he
answered
neb
only
the
unhappy
man
was
halfmad
yes
said
herbert
and
he
was
no
longer
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
it
can
only
be
explained
in
that
way
my
friends
replied
harding
quickly
and
i
understand
now
how
ayrton
was
able
to
point
out
exactly
the
situation
of
tabor
island
since
the
events
which
had
preceded
his
being
left
on
the
island
had
made
it
known
to
him
however
observed
pencroft
if
he
was
not
yet
a
brute
when
he
wrote
that
document
and
if
he
threw
it
into
the
sea
seven
or
eight
years
ago
how
is
it
that
the
paper
has
not
been
injured
by
damp
that
proves
answered
cyrus
harding
that
ayrton
was
deprived
of
intelligence
at
a
more
recent
time
than
he
thinks
of
course
it
must
be
so
replied
pencroft
without
that
the
fact
would
be
unaccountable
unaccountable
indeed
answered
the
engineer
who
did
not
appear
desirous
to
prolong
the
conversation
but
has
ayrton
told
the
truth
asked
the
sailor
yes
replied
the
reporter
the
story
which
he
has
told
is
true
in
every
point
i
remember
quite
well
the
account
in
the
newspapers
of
the
yacht
expedition
undertaken
by
lord
glenarvan
and
its
result
ayrton
has
told
the
truth
added
harding
do
not
doubt
it
pencroft
for
it
was
painful
to
him
people
tell
the
truth
when
they
accuse
themselves
like
that
the
next
daythe
21st
of
decemberthe
colonists
descended
to
the
beach
and
having
climbed
the
plateau
they
found
nothing
of
ayrton
he
had
reached
his
house
in
the
corral
during
the
night
and
the
settlers
judged
it
best
not
to
agitate
him
by
their
presence
time
would
doubtless
perform
what
sympathy
had
been
unable
to
accomplish
herbert
pencroft
and
neb
resumed
their
ordinary
occupations
on
this
day
the
same
work
brought
harding
and
the
reporter
to
the
workshop
at
the
chimneys
do
you
know
my
dear
cyrus
said
gideon
spilett
that
the
explanation
you
gave
yesterday
on
the
subject
of
the
bottle
has
not
satisfied
me
at
all
how
can
it
be
supposed
that
the
unfortunate
man
was
able
to
write
that
document
and
throw
the
bottle
into
the
sea
without
having
the
slightest
recollection
of
it
nor
was
it
he
who
threw
it
in
my
dear
spilett
you
think
then
i
think
nothing
i
know
nothing
interrupted
cyrus
harding
i
am
content
to
rank
this
incident
among
those
which
i
have
not
been
able
to
explain
to
this
day
indeed
cyrus
said
spilett
these
things
are
incredible
your
rescue
the
case
stranded
on
the
sand
tops
adventure
and
lastly
this
bottle
shall
we
never
have
the
answer
to
these
enigmas
yes
replied
the
engineer
quickly
yes
even
if
i
have
to
penetrate
into
the
bowels
of
this
island
chance
will
perhaps
give
us
the
key
to
this
mystery
chance
spilett
i
do
not
believe
in
chance
any
more
than
i
believe
in
mysteries
in
this
world
there
is
a
reason
for
everything
unaccountable
which
has
happened
here
and
that
reason
i
shall
discover
but
in
the
meantime
we
must
work
and
observe
the
month
of
january
arrived
the
year
1867
commenced
the
summer
occupations
were
assiduously
continued
during
the
days
which
followed
herbert
and
spilett
having
gone
in
the
direction
of
the
corral
ascertained
that
ayrton
had
taken
possession
of
the
habitation
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
he
busied
himself
with
the
numerous
flock
confided
to
his
care
and
spared
his
companions
the
trouble
of
coming
every
two
or
three
days
to
visit
the
corral
nevertheless
in
order
not
to
leave
ayrton
in
solitude
for
too
long
a
time
the
settlers
often
paid
him
a
visit
it
was
not
unimportant
either
in
consequence
of
some
suspicions
entertained
by
the
engineer
and
gideon
spilett
that
this
part
of
the
island
should
be
subject
to
a
surveillance
of
some
sort
and
that
ayrton
if
any
incident
occurred
unexpectedly
should
not
neglect
to
inform
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
of
it
nevertheless
it
might
happen
that
something
would
occur
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
bring
rapidly
to
the
engineers
knowledge
independently
of
facts
bearing
on
the
mystery
of
lincoln
island
many
others
might
happen
which
would
call
for
the
prompt
interference
of
the
colonistssuch
as
the
sighting
of
a
vessel
a
wreck
on
the
western
coast
the
possible
arrival
of
pirates
etc
therefore
cyrus
harding
resolved
to
put
the
corral
in
instantaneous
communication
with
granite
house
it
was
on
the
10th
of
january
that
he
made
known
his
project
to
his
companions
why
how
are
you
going
to
manage
that
captain
asked
pencroft
do
you
by
chance
happen
to
think
of
establishing
a
telegraph
exactly
so
answered
the
engineer
electric
cried
herbert
electric
replied
cyrus
harding
we
have
all
the
necessary
materials
for
making
a
battery
and
the
most
difficult
thing
will
be
to
stretch
the
wires
but
by
means
of
a
drawplate
i
think
we
shall
manage
it
well
after
that
returned
the
sailor
i
shall
never
despair
of
seeing
ourselves
some
day
rolling
along
on
a
railway
they
then
set
to
work
beginning
with
the
most
difficult
thing
for
if
they
failed
in
that
it
would
be
useless
to
manufacture
the
battery
and
other
accessories
the
iron
of
lincoln
island
as
has
been
said
was
of
excellent
quality
and
consequently
very
fit
for
being
drawn
out
harding
commenced
by
manufacturing
a
drawplate
that
is
to
say
a
plate
of
steel
pierced
with
conical
holes
of
different
sizes
which
would
successively
bring
the
wire
to
the
wishedfor
tenacity
this
piece
of
steel
after
having
been
tempered
was
fixed
in
as
firm
a
way
as
possible
in
a
solid
framework
planted
in
the
ground
only
a
few
feet
from
the
great
fall
the
motive
power
of
which
the
engineer
intended
to
utilize
in
fact
as
the
fullingmill
was
there
although
not
then
in
use
its
beam
moved
with
extreme
power
would
serve
to
stretch
out
the
wire
by
rolling
it
round
itself
it
was
a
delicate
operation
and
required
much
care
the
iron
prepared
previously
in
long
thin
rods
the
ends
of
which
were
sharpened
with
the
file
having
been
introduced
into
the
largest
hole
of
the
drawplate
was
drawn
out
by
the
beam
which
wound
it
round
itself
to
a
length
of
twentyfive
or
thirty
feet
then
unrolled
and
the
same
operation
was
performed
successively
through
the
holes
of
a
less
size
finally
the
engineer
obtained
wires
from
forty
to
fifty
feet
long
which
could
be
easily
fastened
together
and
stretched
over
the
distance
of
five
miles
which
separated
the
corral
from
the
bounds
of
granite
house
it
did
not
take
more
than
a
few
days
to
perform
this
work
and
indeed
as
soon
as
the
machine
had
been
commenced
cyrus
harding
left
his
companions
to
follow
the
trade
of
wiredrawers
and
occupied
himself
with
manufacturing
his
battery
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
a
battery
with
a
constant
current
it
is
known
that
the
elements
of
modern
batteries
are
generally
composed
of
retort
coal
zinc
and
copper
copper
was
absolutely
wanting
to
the
engineer
who
notwithstanding
all
his
researches
had
never
been
able
to
find
any
trace
of
it
in
lincoln
island
and
was
therefore
obliged
to
do
without
it
retort
coal
that
is
to
say
the
hard
graphite
which
is
found
in
the
retorts
of
gas
manufactories
after
the
coal
has
been
dehydrogenized
could
have
been
obtained
but
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
establish
a
special
apparatus
involving
great
labor
as
to
zinc
it
may
be
remembered
that
the
case
found
at
flotsam
point
was
lined
with
this
metal
which
could
not
be
better
utilized
than
for
this
purpose
cyrus
harding
after
mature
consideration
decided
to
manufacture
a
very
simple
battery
resembling
as
nearly
as
possible
that
invented
by
becquerel
in
1820
and
in
which
zinc
only
is
employed
the
other
substances
azotic
acid
and
potash
were
all
at
his
disposal
the
way
in
which
the
battery
was
composed
was
as
follows
and
the
results
were
to
be
attained
by
the
reaction
of
acid
and
potash
on
each
other
a
number
of
glass
bottles
were
made
and
filled
with
azotic
acid
the
engineer
corked
them
by
means
of
a
stopper
through
which
passed
a
glass
tube
bored
at
its
lower
extremity
and
intended
to
be
plunged
into
the
acid
by
means
of
a
clay
stopper
secured
by
a
rag
into
this
tube
through
its
upper
extremity
he
poured
a
solution
of
potash
previously
obtained
by
burning
and
reducing
to
ashes
various
plants
and
in
this
way
the
acid
and
potash
could
act
on
each
other
through
the
clay
cyrus
harding
then
took
two
slips
of
zinc
one
of
which
was
plunged
into
azotic
acid
the
other
into
a
solution
of
potash
a
current
was
immediately
produced
which
was
transmitted
from
the
slip
of
zinc
in
the
bottle
to
that
in
the
tube
and
the
two
slips
having
been
connected
by
a
metallic
wire
the
slip
in
the
tube
became
the
positive
pole
and
that
in
the
bottle
the
negative
pole
of
the
apparatus
each
bottle
therefore
produced
as
many
currents
as
united
would
be
sufficient
to
produce
all
the
phenomena
of
the
electric
telegraph
such
was
the
ingenious
and
very
simple
apparatus
constructed
by
cyrus
harding
an
apparatus
which
would
allow
them
to
establish
a
telegraphic
communication
between
granite
house
and
the
corral
on
the
6th
of
february
was
commenced
the
planting
along
the
road
to
the
corral
of
posts
furnished
with
glass
insulators
and
intended
to
support
the
wire
a
few
days
after
the
wire
was
extended
ready
to
produce
the
electric
current
at
a
rate
of
twenty
thousand
miles
a
second
two
batteries
had
been
manufactured
one
for
granite
house
the
other
for
the
corral
for
if
it
was
necessary
the
corral
should
be
able
to
communicate
with
granite
house
it
might
also
be
useful
that
granite
house
should
be
able
to
communicate
with
the
corral
as
to
the
receiver
and
manipulator
they
were
very
simple
at
the
two
stations
the
wire
was
wound
round
a
magnet
that
is
to
say
round
a
piece
of
soft
iron
surrounded
with
a
wire
the
communication
was
thus
established
between
the
two
poles
the
current
starting
from
the
positive
pole
traversed
the
wire
passed
through
the
magnet
which
was
temporarily
magnetized
and
returned
through
the
earth
to
the
negative
pole
if
the
current
was
interrupted
the
magnet
immediately
became
unmagnetized
it
was
sufficient
to
place
a
plate
of
soft
iron
before
the
magnet
which
attracted
during
the
passage
of
the
current
would
fall
back
when
the
current
was
interrupted
this
movement
of
the
plate
thus
obtained
harding
could
easily
fasten
to
it
a
needle
arranged
on
a
dial
bearing
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
and
in
this
way
communicate
from
one
station
to
the
other
all
was
completely
arranged
by
the
12th
of
february
on
this
day
harding
having
sent
the
current
through
the
wire
asked
if
all
was
going
on
well
at
the
corral
and
received
in
a
few
moments
a
satisfactory
reply
from
ayrton
pencroft
was
wild
with
joy
and
every
morning
and
evening
he
sent
a
telegram
to
the
corral
which
always
received
an
answer
this
mode
of
communication
presented
two
very
real
advantages
firstly
because
it
enabled
them
to
ascertain
that
ayrton
was
at
the
corral
and
secondly
that
he
was
thus
not
left
completely
isolated
besides
cyrus
harding
never
allowed
a
week
to
pass
without
going
to
see
him
and
ayrton
came
from
time
to
time
to
granite
house
where
he
always
found
a
cordial
welcome
the
fine
season
passed
away
in
the
midst
of
the
usual
work
the
resources
of
the
colony
particularly
in
vegetables
and
corn
increased
from
day
to
day
and
the
plants
brought
from
tabor
island
had
succeeded
perfectly
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
presented
an
encouraging
aspect
the
fourth
harvest
had
been
admirable
and
it
may
be
supposed
that
no
one
thought
of
counting
whether
the
four
hundred
thousand
millions
of
grains
duly
appeared
in
the
crop
however
pencroft
had
thought
of
doing
so
but
cyrus
harding
having
told
him
that
even
if
he
managed
to
count
three
hundred
grains
a
minute
or
nine
thousand
an
hour
it
would
take
him
nearly
five
thousand
fivehundred
years
to
finish
his
task
the
honest
sailor
considered
it
best
to
give
up
the
idea
the
weather
was
splendid
the
temperature
very
warm
in
the
day
time
but
in
the
evening
the
seabreezes
tempered
the
heat
of
the
atmosphere
and
procured
cool
nights
for
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
there
were
however
a
few
storms
which
although
they
were
not
of
long
duration
swept
over
lincoln
island
with
extraordinary
fury
the
lightning
blazed
and
the
thunder
continued
to
roll
for
some
hours
at
this
period
the
little
colony
was
extremely
prosperous
the
tenants
of
the
poultryyard
swarmed
and
they
lived
on
the
surplus
but
it
became
necessary
to
reduce
the
population
to
a
more
moderate
number
the
pigs
had
already
produced
young
and
it
may
be
understood
that
their
care
for
these
animals
absorbed
a
great
part
of
neb
and
pencrofts
time
the
onagers
who
had
two
pretty
colts
were
most
often
mounted
by
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
who
had
become
an
excellent
rider
under
the
reporters
instruction
and
they
also
harnessed
them
to
the
cart
either
for
carrying
wood
and
coal
to
granite
house
or
different
mineral
productions
required
by
the
engineer
several
expeditions
were
made
about
this
time
into
the
depths
of
the
far
west
forests
the
explorers
could
venture
there
without
having
anything
to
fear
from
the
heat
for
the
suns
rays
scarcely
penetrated
through
the
thick
foliage
spreading
above
their
heads
they
thus
visited
all
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
along
which
ran
the
road
from
the
corral
to
the
mouth
of
falls
river
but
in
these
excursions
the
settlers
took
care
to
be
well
armed
for
they
met
with
savage
wild
boars
with
which
they
often
had
a
tussle
they
also
during
this
season
made
fierce
war
against
the
jaguars
gideon
spilett
had
vowed
a
special
hatred
against
them
and
his
pupil
herbert
seconded
him
well
armed
as
they
were
they
no
longer
feared
to
meet
one
of
those
beasts
herberts
courage
was
superb
and
the
reporters
sangfroid
astonishing
already
twenty
magnificent
skins
ornamented
the
diningroom
of
granite
house
and
if
this
continued
the
jaguar
race
would
soon
be
extinct
in
the
island
the
object
aimed
at
by
the
hunters
the
engineer
sometimes
took
part
in
the
expeditions
made
to
the
unknown
parts
of
the
island
which
he
surveyed
with
great
attention
it
was
for
other
traces
than
those
of
animals
that
he
searched
the
thickets
of
the
vast
forest
but
nothing
suspicious
ever
appeared
neither
top
nor
jup
who
accompanied
him
ever
betrayed
by
their
behavior
that
there
was
anything
strange
there
and
yet
more
than
once
again
the
dog
barked
at
the
mouth
of
the
well
which
the
engineer
had
before
explored
without
result
at
this
time
gideon
spilett
aided
by
herbert
took
several
views
of
the
most
picturesque
parts
of
the
island
by
means
of
the
photographic
apparatus
found
in
the
cases
and
of
which
they
had
not
as
yet
made
any
use
this
apparatus
provided
with
a
powerful
objectglass
was
very
complete
substances
necessary
for
the
photographic
reproduction
collodion
for
preparing
the
glass
plate
nitrate
of
silver
to
render
it
sensitive
hyposulfate
of
soda
to
fix
the
prints
obtained
chloride
of
ammonium
in
which
to
soak
the
paper
destined
to
give
the
positive
proof
acetate
of
soda
and
chloride
of
gold
in
which
to
immerse
the
paper
nothing
was
wanting
even
the
papers
were
there
all
prepared
and
before
laying
in
the
printingframe
upon
the
negatives
it
was
sufficient
to
soak
them
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
solution
of
nitrate
of
silver
the
reporter
and
his
assistant
became
in
a
short
time
very
skilful
operators
and
they
obtained
fine
views
of
the
country
such
as
the
island
taken
from
prospect
heights
with
mount
franklin
in
the
distance
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
so
picturesquely
framed
in
high
rocks
the
glade
and
the
corral
with
the
spurs
of
the
mountain
in
the
background
the
curious
development
of
claw
cape
flotsam
point
etc
nor
did
the
photographers
forget
to
take
the
portraits
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
leaving
out
no
one
it
multiplies
us
said
pencroft
and
the
sailor
was
enchanted
to
see
his
own
countenance
faithfully
reproduced
ornamenting
the
walls
of
granite
house
and
he
stopped
as
willingly
before
this
exhibition
as
he
would
have
done
before
the
richest
shopwindows
in
broadway
but
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
most
successful
portrait
was
incontestably
that
of
master
jup
master
jup
had
sat
with
a
gravity
not
to
be
described
and
his
portrait
was
lifelike
he
looks
as
if
he
was
just
going
to
grin
exclaimed
pencroft
and
if
master
jup
had
not
been
satisfied
he
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
please
but
he
was
quite
contented
and
contemplated
his
own
countenance
with
a
sentimental
air
which
expressed
some
small
amount
of
conceit
the
summer
heat
ended
with
the
month
of
march
the
weather
was
sometimes
rainy
but
still
warm
the
month
of
march
which
corresponds
to
the
september
of
northern
latitudes
was
not
so
fine
as
might
have
been
hoped
perhaps
it
announced
an
early
and
rigorous
winter
it
might
have
been
supposed
one
morningthe
21
stthat
the
first
snow
had
already
made
its
appearance
in
fact
herbert
looking
early
from
one
of
the
windows
of
granite
house
exclaimed
hallo
the
islet
is
covered
with
snow
snow
at
this
time
answered
the
reporter
joining
the
boy
their
companions
were
soon
beside
them
but
could
only
ascertain
one
thing
that
not
only
the
islet
but
all
the
beach
below
granite
house
was
covered
with
one
uniform
sheet
of
white
it
must
be
snow
said
pencroft
or
rather
its
very
like
it
replied
neb
but
the
thermometer
marks
fiftyeight
degrees
observed
gideon
spilett
cyrus
harding
gazed
at
the
sheet
of
white
without
saying
anything
for
he
really
did
not
know
how
to
explain
this
phenomenon
at
this
time
of
year
and
in
such
a
temperature
by
jove
exclaimed
pencroft
all
our
plants
will
be
frozen
and
the
sailor
was
about
to
descend
when
he
was
preceded
by
the
nimble
jup
who
slid
down
to
the
sand
but
the
orang
had
not
touched
the
ground
when
the
snowy
sheet
arose
and
dispersed
in
the
air
in
such
innumerable
flakes
that
the
light
of
the
sun
was
obscured
for
some
minutes
birds
cried
herbert
they
were
indeed
swarms
of
seabirds
with
dazzling
white
plumage
they
had
perched
by
thousands
on
the
islet
and
on
the
shore
and
they
disappeared
in
the
distance
leaving
the
colonists
amazed
as
if
they
had
been
present
at
some
transformation
scene
in
which
summer
succeeded
winter
at
the
touch
of
a
fairys
wand
unfortunately
the
change
had
been
so
sudden
that
neither
the
reporter
nor
the
lad
had
been
able
to
bring
down
one
of
these
birds
of
which
they
could
not
recognize
the
species
a
few
days
after
came
the
26th
of
march
the
day
on
which
two
years
before
the
castaways
from
the
air
had
been
thrown
upon
lincoln
island
chapter
19
two
years
already
and
for
two
years
the
colonists
had
had
no
communication
with
their
fellowcreatures
they
were
without
news
from
the
civilized
world
lost
on
this
island
as
completely
as
if
they
had
been
on
the
most
minute
star
of
the
celestial
hemisphere
what
was
now
happening
in
their
country
the
picture
of
their
native
land
was
always
before
their
eyes
the
land
torn
by
civil
war
at
the
time
they
left
it
and
which
the
southern
rebellion
was
perhaps
still
staining
with
blood
it
was
a
great
sorrow
to
them
and
they
often
talked
together
of
these
things
without
ever
doubting
however
that
the
cause
of
the
north
must
triumph
for
the
honor
of
the
american
confederation
during
these
two
years
not
a
vessel
had
passed
in
sight
of
the
island
or
at
least
not
a
sail
had
been
seen
it
was
evident
that
lincoln
island
was
out
of
the
usual
track
and
also
that
it
was
unknownas
was
besides
proved
by
the
mapsfor
though
there
was
no
port
vessels
might
have
visited
it
for
the
purpose
of
renewing
their
store
of
water
but
the
surrounding
ocean
was
deserted
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
the
colonists
must
rely
on
themselves
for
regaining
their
native
land
however
one
chance
of
rescue
existed
and
this
chance
was
discussed
one
day
on
the
first
week
of
april
when
the
colonists
were
gathered
together
in
the
diningroom
of
granite
house
they
had
been
talking
of
america
of
their
native
country
which
they
had
so
little
hope
of
ever
seeing
again
decidedly
we
have
only
one
way
said
spilett
one
single
way
for
leaving
lincoln
island
and
that
is
to
build
a
vessel
large
enough
to
sail
several
hundred
miles
it
appears
to
me
that
when
one
has
built
a
boat
it
is
just
as
easy
to
build
a
ship
and
in
which
we
might
go
to
the
pomoutous
added
herbert
just
as
easily
as
we
went
to
tabor
island
i
do
not
say
no
replied
pencroft
who
had
always
the
casting
vote
in
maritime
questions
i
do
not
say
no
although
it
is
not
exactly
the
same
thing
to
make
a
long
as
a
short
voyage
if
our
little
craft
had
been
caught
in
any
heavy
gale
of
wind
during
the
voyage
to
tabor
island
we
should
have
known
that
land
was
at
no
great
distance
either
way
but
twelve
hundred
miles
is
a
pretty
long
way
and
the
nearest
land
is
at
least
that
distance
would
you
not
in
that
case
pencroft
attempt
the
adventure
asked
the
reporter
i
will
attempt
anything
that
is
desired
mr
spilett
answered
the
sailor
and
you
know
well
that
i
am
not
a
man
to
flinch
remember
besides
that
we
number
another
sailor
amongst
us
now
remarked
neb
who
is
that
asked
pencroft
ayrton
if
he
will
consent
to
come
said
pencroft
nonsense
returned
the
reporter
do
you
think
that
if
lord
glenarvans
yacht
had
appeared
at
tabor
island
while
he
was
still
living
there
ayrton
would
have
refused
to
depart
you
forget
my
friends
then
said
cyrus
harding
that
ayrton
was
not
in
possession
of
his
reason
during
the
last
years
of
his
stay
there
but
that
is
not
the
question
the
point
is
to
know
if
we
may
count
among
our
chances
of
being
rescued
the
return
of
the
scotch
vessel
now
lord
glenarvan
promised
ayrton
that
he
would
return
to
take
him
off
from
tabor
island
when
he
considered
that
his
crimes
were
expiated
and
i
believe
that
he
will
return
yes
said
the
reporter
and
i
will
add
that
he
will
return
soon
for
it
is
twelve
years
since
ayrton
was
abandoned
well
answered
pencroft
i
agree
with
you
that
the
nobleman
will
return
and
soon
too
but
where
will
he
touch
at
tabor
island
and
not
at
lincoln
island
that
is
the
more
certain
replied
herbert
as
lincoln
island
is
not
even
marked
on
the
map
therefore
my
friends
said
the
engineer
we
ought
to
take
the
necessary
precautions
for
making
our
presence
and
that
of
ayrton
on
lincoln
island
known
at
tabor
island
certainly
answered
the
reporter
and
nothing
is
easier
than
to
place
in
the
hut
which
was
captain
grants
and
ayrtons
dwelling
a
notice
which
lord
glenarvan
and
his
crew
cannot
help
finding
giving
the
position
of
our
island
it
is
a
pity
remarked
the
sailor
that
we
forgot
to
take
that
precaution
on
our
first
visit
to
tabor
island
and
why
should
we
have
done
it
asked
herbert
at
that
time
we
did
not
know
ayrtons
history
we
did
not
know
that
any
one
was
likely
to
come
some
day
to
fetch
him
and
when
we
did
know
his
history
the
season
was
too
advanced
to
allow
us
to
return
then
to
tabor
island
yes
replied
harding
it
was
too
late
and
we
must
put
off
the
voyage
until
next
spring
but
suppose
the
scotch
yacht
comes
before
that
said
pencroft
that
is
not
probable
replied
the
engineer
for
lord
glenarvan
would
not
choose
the
winter
season
to
venture
into
these
seas
either
he
has
already
returned
to
tabor
island
since
ayrton
has
been
with
us
that
is
to
say
during
the
last
five
months
and
has
left
again
or
he
will
not
come
till
later
and
it
will
be
time
enough
in
the
first
fine
october
days
to
go
to
tabor
island
and
leave
a
notice
there
we
must
allow
said
neb
that
it
will
be
very
unfortunate
if
the
duncan
has
returned
to
these
parts
only
a
few
months
ago
i
hope
that
it
is
not
so
replied
cyrus
harding
and
that
heaven
has
not
deprived
us
of
the
best
chance
which
remains
to
us
i
think
observed
the
reporter
that
at
any
rate
we
shall
know
what
we
have
to
depend
on
when
we
have
been
to
tabor
island
for
if
the
yacht
has
returned
there
they
will
necessarily
have
left
some
traces
of
their
visit
that
is
evident
answered
the
engineer
so
then
my
friends
since
we
have
this
chance
of
returning
to
our
country
we
must
wait
patiently
and
if
it
is
taken
from
us
we
shall
see
what
will
be
best
to
do
at
any
rate
remarked
pencroft
it
is
well
understood
that
if
we
do
leave
lincoln
island
it
will
not
be
because
we
were
uncomfortable
there
no
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
it
will
be
because
we
are
far
from
all
that
a
man
holds
dearest
in
the
world
his
family
his
friends
his
native
land
matters
being
thus
decided
the
building
of
a
vessel
large
enough
to
sail
either
to
the
archipelagoes
in
the
north
or
to
new
zealand
in
the
west
was
no
longer
talked
of
and
they
busied
themselves
in
their
accustomed
occupations
with
a
view
to
wintering
a
third
time
in
granite
house
however
it
was
agreed
that
before
the
stormy
weather
came
on
their
little
vessel
should
be
employed
in
making
a
voyage
round
the
island
a
complete
survey
of
the
coast
had
not
yet
been
made
and
the
colonists
had
but
an
imperfect
idea
of
the
shore
to
the
west
and
north
from
the
mouth
of
falls
river
to
the
mandible
capes
as
well
as
of
the
narrow
bay
between
them
which
opened
like
a
sharks
jaws
the
plan
of
this
excursion
was
proposed
by
pencroft
and
cyrus
harding
fully
acquiesced
in
it
for
he
himself
wished
to
see
this
part
of
his
domain
the
weather
was
variable
but
the
barometer
did
not
fluctuate
by
sudden
movements
and
they
could
therefore
count
on
tolerable
weather
however
during
the
first
week
of
april
after
a
sudden
barometrical
fall
a
renewed
rise
was
marked
by
a
heavy
gale
of
wind
lasting
five
or
six
days
then
the
needle
of
the
instrument
remained
stationary
at
a
height
of
twentynine
inches
and
ninetenths
and
the
weather
appeared
propitious
for
an
excursion
the
departure
was
fixed
for
the
16th
of
april
and
the
bonadventure
anchored
in
port
balloon
was
provisioned
for
a
voyage
which
might
be
of
some
duration
cyrus
harding
informed
ayrton
of
the
projected
expedition
and
proposed
that
he
should
take
part
in
it
but
ayrton
preferring
to
remain
on
shore
it
was
decided
that
he
should
come
to
granite
house
during
the
absence
of
his
companions
master
jup
was
ordered
to
keep
him
company
and
made
no
remonstrance
on
the
morning
of
the
16th
of
april
all
the
colonists
including
top
embarked
a
fine
breeze
blew
from
the
southwest
and
the
bonadventure
tacked
on
leaving
port
balloon
so
as
to
reach
reptile
end
of
the
ninety
miles
which
the
perimeter
of
the
island
measured
twenty
included
the
south
coast
between
the
port
and
the
promontory
the
wind
being
right
ahead
it
was
necessary
to
hug
the
shore
it
took
the
whole
day
to
reach
the
promontory
for
the
vessel
on
leaving
port
had
only
two
hours
of
ebb
tide
and
had
therefore
to
make
way
for
six
hours
against
the
flood
it
was
nightfall
before
the
promontory
was
doubled
the
sailor
then
proposed
to
the
engineer
that
they
should
continue
sailing
slowly
with
two
reefs
in
the
sail
but
harding
preferred
to
anchor
a
few
cablelengths
from
the
shore
so
as
to
survey
that
part
of
the
coast
during
the
day
it
was
agreed
also
that
as
they
were
anxious
for
a
minute
exploration
of
the
coast
they
should
not
sail
during
the
night
but
would
always
when
the
weather
permitted
it
be
at
anchor
near
the
shore
the
night
was
passed
under
the
promontory
and
the
wind
having
fallen
nothing
disturbed
the
silence
the
passengers
with
the
exception
of
the
sailor
scarcely
slept
as
well
on
board
the
bonadventure
as
they
would
have
done
in
their
rooms
at
granite
house
but
they
did
sleep
however
pencroft
set
sail
at
break
of
day
and
by
going
on
the
larboard
tack
they
could
keep
close
to
the
shore
the
colonists
knew
this
beautiful
wooded
coast
since
they
had
already
explored
it
on
foot
and
yet
it
again
excited
their
admiration
they
coasted
along
as
close
in
as
possible
so
as
to
notice
everything
avoiding
always
the
trunks
of
trees
which
floated
here
and
there
several
times
also
they
anchored
and
gideon
spilett
took
photographs
of
the
superb
scenery
about
noon
the
bonadventure
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
falls
river
beyond
on
the
left
bank
a
few
scattered
trees
appeared
and
three
miles
further
even
these
dwindled
into
solitary
groups
among
the
western
spurs
of
the
mountain
whose
arid
ridge
sloped
down
to
the
shore
what
a
contrast
between
the
northern
and
southern
part
of
the
coast
in
proportion
as
one
was
woody
and
fertile
so
was
the
other
rugged
and
barren
it
might
have
been
designated
as
one
of
those
iron
coasts
as
they
are
called
in
some
countries
and
its
wild
confusion
appeared
to
indicate
that
a
sudden
crystallization
had
been
produced
in
the
yet
liquid
basalt
of
some
distant
geological
sea
these
stupendous
masses
would
have
terrified
the
settlers
if
they
had
been
cast
at
first
on
this
part
of
the
island
they
had
not
been
able
to
perceive
the
sinister
aspect
of
this
shore
from
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
for
they
overlooked
it
from
too
great
a
height
but
viewed
from
the
sea
it
presented
a
wild
appearance
which
could
not
perhaps
be
equaled
in
any
corner
of
the
globe
the
bonadventure
sailed
along
this
coast
for
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
it
was
easy
to
see
that
it
was
composed
of
blocks
of
all
sizes
from
twenty
to
three
hundred
feet
in
height
and
of
all
shapes
round
like
towers
prismatic
like
steeples
pyramidal
like
obelisks
conical
like
factory
chimneys
an
iceberg
of
the
polar
seas
could
not
have
been
more
capricious
in
its
terrible
sublimity
here
bridges
were
thrown
from
one
rock
to
another
there
arches
like
those
of
a
wave
into
the
depths
of
which
the
eye
could
not
penetrate
in
one
place
large
vaulted
excavations
presented
a
monumental
aspect
in
another
a
crowd
of
columns
spires
and
arches
such
as
no
gothic
cathedral
ever
possessed
every
caprice
of
nature
still
more
varied
than
those
of
the
imagination
appeared
on
this
grand
coast
which
extended
over
a
length
of
eight
or
nine
miles
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
gazed
with
a
feeling
of
surprise
bordering
on
stupefaction
but
although
they
remained
silent
top
not
being
troubled
with
feelings
of
this
sort
uttered
barks
which
were
repeated
by
the
thousand
echoes
of
the
basaltic
cliff
the
engineer
even
observed
that
these
barks
had
something
strange
in
them
like
those
which
the
dog
had
uttered
at
the
mouth
of
the
well
in
granite
house
let
us
go
close
in
said
he
and
the
bonadventure
sailed
as
near
as
possible
to
the
rocky
shore
perhaps
some
cave
which
it
would
be
advisable
to
explore
existed
there
but
harding
saw
nothing
not
a
cavern
not
a
cleft
which
could
serve
as
a
retreat
to
any
being
whatever
for
the
foot
of
the
cliff
was
washed
by
the
surf
soon
tops
barks
ceased
and
the
vessel
continued
her
course
at
a
few
cableslength
from
the
coast
in
the
northwest
part
of
the
island
the
shore
became
again
flat
and
sandy
a
few
trees
here
and
there
rose
above
a
low
marshy
ground
which
the
colonists
had
already
surveyed
and
in
violent
contrast
to
the
other
desert
shore
life
was
again
manifested
by
the
presence
of
myriads
of
waterfowl
that
evening
the
bonadventure
anchored
in
a
small
bay
to
the
north
of
the
island
near
the
land
such
was
the
depth
of
water
there
the
night
passed
quietly
for
the
breeze
died
away
with
the
last
light
of
day
and
only
rose
again
with
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
as
it
was
easy
to
land
the
usual
hunters
of
the
colony
that
is
to
say
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
went
for
a
ramble
of
two
hours
or
so
and
returned
with
several
strings
of
wild
duck
and
snipe
top
had
done
wonders
and
not
a
bird
had
been
lost
thanks
to
his
zeal
and
cleverness
at
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
the
bonadventure
set
sail
and
ran
rapidly
towards
north
mandible
cape
for
the
wind
was
right
astern
and
freshening
rapidly
however
observed
pencroft
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
a
gale
came
up
from
the
west
yesterday
the
sun
set
in
a
very
redlooking
horizon
and
now
this
morning
those
marestails
dont
forbode
anything
good
these
marestails
are
cirrus
clouds
scattered
in
the
zenith
their
height
from
the
sea
being
less
than
five
thousand
feet
they
look
like
light
pieces
of
cotton
wool
and
their
presence
usually
announces
some
sudden
change
in
the
weather
well
said
harding
let
us
carry
as
much
sail
as
possible
and
run
for
shelter
into
shark
gulf
i
think
that
the
bonadventure
will
be
safe
there
perfectly
replied
pencroft
and
besides
the
north
coast
is
merely
sand
very
uninteresting
to
look
at
i
shall
not
be
sorry
resumed
the
engineer
to
pass
not
only
tonight
but
tomorrow
in
that
bay
which
is
worth
being
carefully
explored
i
think
that
we
shall
be
obliged
to
do
so
whether
we
like
it
or
not
answered
pencroft
for
the
sky
looks
very
threatening
towards
the
west
dirty
weather
is
coming
on
at
any
rate
we
have
a
favorable
wind
for
reaching
cape
mandible
observed
the
reporter
a
very
fine
wind
replied
the
sailor
but
we
must
tack
to
enter
the
gulf
and
i
should
like
to
see
my
way
clear
in
these
unknown
quarters
quarters
which
appear
to
be
filled
with
rocks
added
herbert
if
we
judge
by
what
we
saw
on
the
south
coast
of
shark
gulf
pencroft
said
cyrus
harding
do
as
you
think
best
we
will
leave
it
to
you
dont
make
your
mind
uneasy
captain
replied
the
sailor
i
shall
not
expose
myself
needlessly
i
would
rather
a
knife
were
run
into
my
ribs
than
a
sharp
rock
into
those
of
my
bonadventure
that
which
pencroft
called
ribs
was
the
part
of
his
vessel
under
water
and
he
valued
it
more
than
his
own
skin
what
oclock
is
it
asked
pencroft
ten
oclock
replied
gideon
spilett
and
what
distance
is
it
to
the
cape
captain
about
fifteen
miles
replied
the
engineer
thats
a
matter
of
two
hours
and
a
half
said
the
sailor
and
we
shall
be
off
the
cape
between
twelve
and
one
oclock
unluckily
the
tide
will
be
turning
at
that
moment
and
will
be
ebbing
out
of
the
gulf
i
am
afraid
that
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
get
in
having
both
wind
and
tide
against
us
and
the
more
so
that
it
is
a
full
moon
today
remarked
herbert
and
these
april
tides
are
very
strong
well
pencroft
asked
harding
can
you
not
anchor
off
the
cape
anchor
near
land
with
bad
weather
coming
on
exclaimed
the
sailor
what
are
you
thinking
of
captain
we
should
run
aground
of
a
certainty
what
will
you
do
then
i
shall
try
to
keep
in
the
offing
until
the
flood
that
is
to
say
till
about
seven
in
the
evening
and
if
there
is
still
light
enough
i
will
try
to
enter
the
gulf
if
not
we
must
stand
off
and
on
during
the
night
and
we
will
enter
tomorrow
at
sunrise
as
i
told
you
pencroft
we
will
leave
it
to
you
answered
harding
ah
said
pencroft
if
there
was
only
a
lighthouse
on
the
coast
it
would
be
much
more
convenient
for
sailors
yes
replied
herbert
and
this
time
we
shall
have
no
obliging
engineer
to
light
a
fire
to
guide
us
into
port
why
indeed
my
dear
cyrus
said
spilett
we
have
never
thanked
you
but
frankly
without
that
fire
we
should
never
have
been
able
a
fire
asked
harding
much
astonished
at
the
reporters
words
we
mean
captain
answered
pencroft
that
on
board
the
bonadventure
we
were
very
anxious
during
the
few
hours
before
our
return
and
we
should
have
passed
to
windward
of
the
island
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
precaution
you
took
of
lighting
a
fire
the
night
of
the
19th
of
october
on
prospect
heights
yes
yes
that
was
a
lucky
idea
of
mine
replied
the
engineer
and
this
time
continued
the
sailor
unless
the
idea
occurs
to
ayrton
there
will
be
no
one
to
do
us
that
little
service
no
no
one
answered
cyrus
harding
a
few
minutes
after
finding
himself
alone
in
the
bows
of
the
vessel
with
the
reporter
the
engineer
bent
down
and
whispered
if
there
is
one
thing
certain
in
this
world
spilett
it
is
that
i
never
lighted
any
fire
during
the
night
of
the
19th
of
october
neither
on
prospect
heights
nor
on
any
other
part
of
the
island
chapter
20
things
happened
as
pencroft
had
predicted
he
being
seldom
mistaken
in
his
prognostications
the
wind
rose
and
from
a
fresh
breeze
it
soon
increased
to
a
regular
gale
that
is
to
say
it
acquired
a
speed
of
from
forty
to
fortyfive
miles
an
hour
before
which
a
ship
in
the
open
sea
would
have
run
under
closereefed
topsails
now
as
it
was
nearly
six
oclock
when
the
bonadventure
reached
the
gulf
and
as
at
that
moment
the
tide
turned
it
was
impossible
to
enter
they
were
therefore
compelled
to
stand
off
for
even
if
he
had
wished
to
do
so
pencroft
could
not
have
gained
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
hoisting
the
jib
to
the
mainmast
by
way
of
a
stormsail
he
hove
to
putting
the
head
of
the
vessel
towards
the
land
fortunately
although
the
wind
was
strong
the
sea
being
sheltered
by
the
land
did
not
run
very
high
they
had
then
little
to
fear
from
the
waves
which
always
endanger
small
craft
the
bonadventure
would
doubtlessly
not
have
capsized
for
she
was
well
ballasted
but
enormous
masses
of
water
falling
on
the
deck
might
injure
her
if
her
timbers
could
not
sustain
them
pencroft
as
a
good
sailor
was
prepared
for
anything
certainly
he
had
great
confidence
in
his
vessel
but
nevertheless
he
awaited
the
return
of
day
with
some
anxiety
during
the
night
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
had
no
opportunity
for
talking
together
and
yet
the
words
pronounced
in
the
reporters
ear
by
the
engineer
were
well
worth
being
discussed
together
with
the
mysterious
influence
which
appeared
to
reign
over
lincoln
island
gideon
spilett
did
not
cease
from
pondering
over
this
new
and
inexplicable
incident
the
appearance
of
a
fire
on
the
coast
of
the
island
the
fire
had
actually
been
seen
his
companions
herbert
and
pencroft
had
seen
it
with
him
the
fire
had
served
to
signalize
the
position
of
the
island
during
that
dark
night
and
they
had
not
doubted
that
it
was
lighted
by
the
engineers
hand
and
here
was
cyrus
harding
expressly
declaring
that
he
had
never
done
anything
of
the
sort
spilett
resolved
to
recur
to
this
incident
as
soon
as
the
bonadventure
returned
and
to
urge
cyrus
harding
to
acquaint
their
companions
with
these
strange
facts
perhaps
it
would
be
decided
to
make
in
common
a
complete
investigation
of
every
part
of
lincoln
island
however
that
might
be
on
this
evening
no
fire
was
lighted
on
these
yet
unknown
shores
which
formed
the
entrance
to
the
gulf
and
the
little
vessel
stood
off
during
the
night
when
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
appeared
in
the
western
horizon
the
wind
which
had
slightly
fallen
shifted
two
points
and
enabled
pencroft
to
enter
the
narrow
gulf
with
greater
ease
towards
seven
oclock
in
the
morning
the
bonadventure
weathering
the
north
mandible
cape
entered
the
strait
and
glided
on
to
the
waters
so
strangely
enclosed
in
the
frame
of
lava
well
said
pencroft
this
bay
would
make
admirable
roads
in
which
a
whole
fleet
could
lie
at
their
ease
what
is
especially
curious
observed
harding
is
that
the
gulf
has
been
formed
by
two
rivers
of
lava
thrown
out
by
the
volcano
and
accumulated
by
successive
eruptions
the
result
is
that
the
gulf
is
completely
sheltered
on
all
sides
and
i
believe
that
even
in
the
stormiest
weather
the
sea
here
must
be
as
calm
as
a
lake
no
doubt
returned
the
sailor
since
the
wind
has
only
that
narrow
entrance
between
the
two
capes
to
get
in
by
and
besides
the
north
cape
protects
that
of
the
south
in
a
way
which
would
make
the
entrance
of
gusts
very
difficult
i
declare
our
bonadventure
could
stay
here
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
without
even
dragging
at
her
anchor
it
is
rather
large
for
her
observed
the
reporter
well
mr
spilett
replied
the
sailor
i
agree
that
it
is
too
large
for
the
bonadventure
but
if
the
fleets
of
the
union
were
in
want
of
a
harbor
in
the
pacific
i
dont
think
they
would
ever
find
a
better
place
than
this
we
are
in
the
sharks
mouth
remarked
neb
alluding
to
the
form
of
the
gulf
right
into
its
mouth
my
honest
neb
replied
herbert
but
you
are
not
afraid
that
it
will
shut
upon
us
are
you
no
mr
herbert
answered
neb
and
yet
this
gulf
here
doesnt
please
me
much
it
has
a
wicked
look
hallo
cried
pencroft
here
is
neb
turning
up
his
nose
at
my
gulf
just
as
i
was
thinking
of
presenting
it
to
america
but
at
any
rate
is
the
water
deep
enough
asked
the
engineer
for
a
depth
sufficient
for
the
keel
of
the
bonadventure
would
not
be
enough
for
those
of
our
ironclads
that
is
easily
found
out
replied
pencroft
and
the
sailor
sounded
with
a
long
cord
which
served
him
as
a
leadline
and
to
which
was
fastened
a
lump
of
iron
this
cord
measured
nearly
fifty
fathoms
and
its
entire
length
was
unrolled
without
finding
any
bottom
there
exclaimed
pencroft
our
ironclads
can
come
here
after
all
they
would
not
run
aground
indeed
said
gideon
spilett
this
gulf
is
a
regular
abyss
but
taking
into
consideration
the
volcanic
origin
of
the
island
it
is
not
astonishing
that
the
sea
should
offer
similar
depressions
one
would
say
too
observed
herbert
that
these
cliffs
were
perfectly
perpendicular
and
i
believe
that
at
their
foot
even
with
a
line
five
or
six
times
longer
pencroft
would
not
find
bottom
that
is
all
very
well
then
said
the
reporter
but
i
must
point
out
to
pencroft
that
his
harbor
is
wanting
in
one
very
important
respect
and
what
is
that
mr
spilett
an
opening
a
cutting
of
some
sort
to
give
access
to
the
interior
of
the
island
i
do
not
see
a
spot
on
which
we
could
land
and
in
fact
the
steep
lava
cliffs
did
not
afford
a
single
place
suitable
for
landing
they
formed
an
insuperable
barrier
recalling
but
with
more
wildness
the
fiords
of
norway
the
bonadventure
coasting
as
close
as
possible
along
the
cliffs
did
not
discover
even
a
projection
which
would
allow
the
passengers
to
leave
the
deck
pencroft
consoled
himself
by
saying
that
with
the
help
of
a
mine
they
could
soon
open
out
the
cliff
when
that
was
necessary
and
then
as
there
was
evidently
nothing
to
be
done
in
the
gulf
he
steered
his
vessel
towards
the
strait
and
passed
out
at
about
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
ah
said
neb
uttering
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
one
might
really
say
that
the
honest
negro
did
not
feel
at
his
ease
in
those
enormous
jaws
the
distance
from
mandible
cape
to
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
was
not
more
than
eight
miles
the
head
of
the
bonadventure
was
put
towards
granite
house
and
a
fair
wind
filling
her
sails
she
ran
rapidly
along
the
coast
to
the
enormous
lava
rocks
succeeded
soon
those
capricious
sand
dunes
among
which
the
engineer
had
been
so
singularly
recovered
and
which
seabirds
frequented
in
thousands
about
four
oclock
pencroft
leaving
the
point
of
the
islet
on
his
left
entered
the
channel
which
separated
it
from
the
coast
and
at
five
oclock
the
anchor
of
the
bonadventure
was
buried
in
the
sand
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
the
colonists
had
been
absent
three
days
from
their
dwelling
ayrton
was
waiting
for
them
on
the
beach
and
jup
came
joyously
to
meet
them
giving
vent
to
deep
grunts
of
satisfaction
a
complete
exploration
of
the
coast
of
the
island
had
now
been
made
and
no
suspicious
appearances
had
been
observed
if
any
mysterious
being
resided
on
it
it
could
only
be
under
cover
of
the
impenetrable
forest
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
to
which
the
colonists
had
not
yet
directed
their
investigations
gideon
spilett
discussed
these
things
with
the
engineer
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
direct
the
attention
of
their
companions
to
the
strange
character
of
certain
incidents
which
had
occurred
on
the
island
and
of
which
the
last
was
the
most
unaccountable
however
harding
returning
to
the
fact
of
a
fire
having
been
kindled
on
the
shore
by
an
unknown
hand
could
not
refrain
from
repeating
for
the
twentieth
time
to
the
reporter
but
are
you
quite
sure
of
having
seen
it
was
it
not
a
partial
eruption
of
the
volcano
or
perhaps
some
meteor
no
cyrus
answered
the
reporter
it
was
certainly
a
fire
lighted
by
the
hand
of
man
besides
question
pencroft
and
herbert
they
saw
it
as
i
saw
it
myself
and
they
will
confirm
my
words
in
consequence
therefore
a
few
days
after
on
the
25th
of
april
in
the
evening
when
the
settlers
were
all
collected
on
prospect
heights
cyrus
harding
began
by
saying
my
friends
i
think
it
my
duty
to
call
your
attention
to
certain
incidents
which
have
occurred
in
the
island
on
the
subject
of
which
i
shall
be
happy
to
have
your
advice
these
incidents
are
so
to
speak
supernatural
supernatural
exclaimed
the
sailor
emitting
a
volume
of
smoke
from
his
mouth
can
it
be
possible
that
our
island
is
supernatural
no
pencroft
but
mysterious
most
certainly
replied
the
engineer
unless
you
can
explain
that
which
spilett
and
i
have
until
now
failed
to
understand
speak
away
captain
answered
the
sailor
well
have
you
understood
then
said
the
engineer
how
was
it
that
after
falling
into
the
sea
i
was
found
a
quarter
of
a
mile
into
the
interior
of
the
island
and
that
without
my
having
any
consciousness
of
my
removal
there
unless
being
unconscious
said
pencroft
that
is
not
admissible
replied
the
engineer
but
to
continue
have
you
understood
how
top
was
able
to
discover
your
retreat
five
miles
from
the
cave
in
which
i
was
lying
the
dogs
instinct
observed
herbert
singular
instinct
returned
the
reporter
since
notwithstanding
the
storm
of
rain
and
wind
which
was
raging
during
that
night
top
arrived
at
the
chimneys
dry
and
without
a
speck
of
mud
let
us
continue
resumed
the
engineer
have
you
understood
how
our
dog
was
so
strangely
thrown
up
out
of
the
water
of
the
lake
after
his
struggle
with
the
dugong
no
i
confess
not
at
all
replied
pencroft
and
the
wound
which
the
dugong
had
in
its
side
a
wound
which
seemed
to
have
been
made
with
a
sharp
instrument
that
cant
be
understood
either
let
us
continue
again
said
harding
have
you
understood
my
friends
how
that
bullet
got
into
the
body
of
the
young
peccary
how
that
case
happened
to
be
so
fortunately
stranded
without
there
being
any
trace
of
a
wreck
how
that
bottle
containing
the
document
presented
itself
so
opportunely
during
our
first
seaexcursion
how
our
canoe
having
broken
its
moorings
floated
down
the
current
of
the
mercy
and
rejoined
us
at
the
very
moment
we
needed
it
how
after
the
ape
invasion
the
ladder
was
so
obligingly
thrown
down
from
granite
house
and
lastly
how
the
document
which
ayrton
asserts
was
never
written
by
him
fell
into
our
hands
as
cyrus
harding
thus
enumerated
without
forgetting
one
the
singular
incidents
which
had
occurred
in
the
island
herbert
neb
and
pencroft
stared
at
each
other
not
knowing
what
to
reply
for
this
succession
of
incidents
grouped
thus
for
the
first
time
could
not
but
excite
their
surprise
to
the
highest
degree
pon
my
word
said
pencroft
at
last
you
are
right
captain
and
it
is
difficult
to
explain
all
these
things
well
my
friends
resumed
the
engineer
a
last
fact
has
just
been
added
to
these
and
it
is
no
less
incomprehensible
than
the
others
what
is
it
captain
asked
herbert
quickly
when
you
were
returning
from
tabor
island
pencroft
continued
the
engineer
you
said
that
a
fire
appeared
on
lincoln
island
certainly
answered
the
sailor
and
you
are
quite
certain
of
having
seen
this
fire
as
sure
as
i
see
you
now
you
also
herbert
why
captain
cried
herbert
that
fire
was
blazing
like
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
but
was
it
not
a
star
urged
the
engineer
no
replied
pencroft
for
the
sky
was
covered
with
thick
clouds
and
at
any
rate
a
star
would
not
have
been
so
low
on
the
horizon
but
mr
spilett
saw
it
as
well
as
we
and
he
will
confirm
our
words
i
will
add
said
the
reporter
that
the
fire
was
very
bright
and
that
it
shot
up
like
a
sheet
of
lightning
yes
yes
exactly
added
herbert
and
it
was
certainly
placed
on
the
heights
of
granite
house
well
my
friends
replied
cyrus
harding
during
the
night
of
the
19th
of
october
neither
neb
nor
i
lighted
any
fire
on
the
coast
you
did
not
exclaimed
pencroft
in
the
height
of
his
astonishment
not
being
able
to
finish
his
sentence
we
did
not
leave
granite
house
answered
cyrus
harding
and
if
a
fire
appeared
on
the
coast
it
was
lighted
by
another
hand
than
ours
pencroft
herbert
and
neb
were
stupefied
no
illusion
could
be
possible
and
a
fire
had
actually
met
their
eyes
during
the
night
of
the
19th
of
october
yes
they
had
to
acknowledge
it
a
mystery
existed
an
inexplicable
influence
evidently
favorable
to
the
colonists
but
very
irritating
to
their
curiosity
was
executed
always
in
the
nick
of
time
on
lincoln
island
could
there
be
some
being
hidden
in
its
profoundest
recesses
it
was
necessary
at
any
cost
to
ascertain
this
harding
also
reminded
his
companions
of
the
singular
behavior
of
top
and
jup
when
they
prowled
round
the
mouth
of
the
well
which
placed
granite
house
in
communication
with
the
sea
and
he
told
them
that
he
had
explored
the
well
without
discovering
anything
suspicious
the
final
resolve
taken
in
consequence
of
this
conversation
by
all
the
members
of
the
colony
was
that
as
soon
as
the
fine
season
returned
they
would
thoroughly
search
the
whole
of
the
island
but
from
that
day
pencroft
appeared
to
be
anxious
he
felt
as
if
the
island
which
he
had
made
his
own
personal
property
belonged
to
him
entirely
no
longer
and
that
he
shared
it
with
another
master
to
whom
willing
or
not
he
felt
subject
neb
and
he
often
talked
of
those
unaccountable
things
and
both
their
natures
inclining
them
to
the
marvelous
were
not
far
from
believing
that
lincoln
island
was
under
the
dominion
of
some
supernatural
power
in
the
meanwhile
the
bad
weather
came
with
the
month
of
may
the
november
of
the
northern
zones
it
appeared
that
the
winter
would
be
severe
and
forward
the
preparations
for
the
winter
season
were
therefore
commenced
without
delay
nevertheless
the
colonists
were
well
prepared
to
meet
the
winter
however
hard
it
might
be
they
had
plenty
of
felt
clothing
and
the
musmons
very
numerous
by
this
time
had
furnished
an
abundance
of
wool
necessary
for
the
manufacture
of
this
warm
material
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
ayrton
had
been
provided
with
this
comfortable
clothing
cyrus
harding
proposed
that
he
should
come
to
spend
the
bad
season
with
them
in
granite
house
where
he
would
be
better
lodged
than
at
the
corral
and
ayrton
promised
to
do
so
as
soon
as
the
last
work
at
the
corral
was
finished
he
did
this
towards
the
middle
of
april
from
that
time
ayrton
shared
the
common
life
and
made
himself
useful
on
all
occasions
but
still
humble
and
sad
he
never
took
part
in
the
pleasures
of
his
companions
for
the
greater
part
of
this
the
third
winter
which
the
settlers
passed
in
lincoln
island
they
were
confined
to
granite
house
there
were
many
violent
storms
and
frightful
tempests
which
appeared
to
shake
the
rocks
to
their
very
foundations
immense
waves
threatened
to
overwhelm
the
island
and
certainly
any
vessel
anchored
near
the
shore
would
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
twice
during
one
of
these
hurricanes
the
mercy
swelled
to
such
a
degree
as
to
give
reason
to
fear
that
the
bridges
would
be
swept
away
and
it
was
necessary
to
strengthen
those
on
the
shore
which
disappeared
under
the
foaming
waters
when
the
sea
beat
against
the
beach
it
may
well
be
supposed
that
such
storms
comparable
to
waterspouts
in
which
were
mingled
rain
and
snow
would
cause
great
havoc
on
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
the
mill
and
the
poultryyard
particularly
suffered
the
colonists
were
often
obliged
to
make
immediate
repairs
without
which
the
safety
of
the
birds
would
have
been
seriously
threatened
during
the
worst
weather
several
jaguars
and
troops
of
quadrumana
ventured
to
the
edge
of
the
plateau
and
it
was
always
to
be
feared
that
the
most
active
and
audacious
would
urged
by
hunger
manage
to
cross
the
stream
which
besides
when
frozen
offered
them
an
easy
passage
plantations
and
domestic
animals
would
then
have
been
infallibly
destroyed
without
a
constant
watch
and
it
was
often
necessary
to
make
use
of
the
guns
to
keep
those
dangerous
visitors
at
a
respectful
distance
occupation
was
not
wanting
to
the
colonists
for
without
reckoning
their
outdoor
cares
they
had
always
a
thousand
plans
for
the
fitting
up
of
granite
house
they
had
also
some
fine
sporting
excursions
which
were
made
during
the
frost
in
the
vast
tadorn
marsh
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
aided
by
jup
and
top
did
not
miss
a
shot
in
the
midst
of
myriads
of
wildduck
snipe
teal
and
others
the
access
to
these
huntinggrounds
was
easy
besides
whether
they
reached
them
by
the
road
to
port
balloon
after
having
passed
the
mercy
bridge
or
by
turning
the
rocks
from
flotsam
point
the
hunters
were
never
distant
from
granite
house
more
than
two
or
three
miles
thus
passed
the
four
winter
months
which
were
really
rigorous
that
is
to
say
june
july
august
and
september
but
in
short
granite
house
did
not
suffer
much
from
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
and
it
was
the
same
with
the
corral
which
less
exposed
than
the
plateau
and
sheltered
partly
by
mount
franklin
only
received
the
remains
of
the
hurricanes
already
broken
by
the
forests
and
the
high
rocks
of
the
shore
the
damages
there
were
consequently
of
small
importance
and
the
activity
and
skill
of
ayrton
promptly
repaired
them
when
some
time
in
october
he
returned
to
pass
a
few
days
in
the
corral
during
this
winter
no
fresh
inexplicable
incident
occurred
nothing
strange
happened
although
pencroft
and
neb
were
on
the
watch
for
the
most
insignificant
facts
to
which
they
attached
any
mysterious
cause
top
and
jup
themselves
no
longer
growled
round
the
well
or
gave
any
signs
of
uneasiness
it
appeared
therefore
as
if
the
series
of
supernatural
incidents
was
interrupted
although
they
often
talked
of
them
during
the
evenings
in
granite
house
and
they
remained
thoroughly
resolved
that
the
island
should
be
searched
even
in
those
parts
the
most
difficult
to
explore
but
an
event
of
the
highest
importance
and
of
which
the
consequences
might
be
terrible
momentarily
diverted
from
their
projects
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
it
was
the
month
of
october
the
fine
season
was
swiftly
returning
nature
was
reviving
and
among
the
evergreen
foliage
of
the
coniferae
which
formed
the
border
of
the
wood
already
appeared
the
young
leaves
of
the
banksias
deodars
and
other
trees
it
may
be
remembered
that
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
had
at
different
times
taken
photographic
views
of
lincoln
island
now
on
the
17th
of
this
month
of
october
towards
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
herbert
enticed
by
the
charms
of
the
sky
thought
of
reproducing
union
bay
which
was
opposite
to
prospect
heights
from
cape
mandible
to
claw
cape
the
horizon
was
beautifully
clear
and
the
sea
undulating
under
a
soft
breeze
was
as
calm
as
the
waters
of
a
lake
sparkling
here
and
there
under
the
suns
rays
the
apparatus
had
been
placed
at
one
of
the
windows
of
the
diningroom
at
granite
house
and
consequently
overlooked
the
shore
and
the
bay
herbert
proceeded
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
and
the
negative
obtained
he
went
away
to
fix
it
by
means
of
the
chemicals
deposited
in
a
dark
nook
of
granite
house
returning
to
the
bright
light
and
examining
it
well
herbert
perceived
on
his
negative
an
almost
imperceptible
little
spot
on
the
sea
horizon
he
endeavored
to
make
it
disappear
by
reiterated
washing
but
could
not
accomplish
it
it
is
a
flaw
in
the
glass
he
thought
and
then
he
had
the
curiosity
to
examine
this
flaw
with
a
strong
magnifier
which
he
unscrewed
from
one
of
the
telescopes
but
he
had
scarcely
looked
at
it
when
he
uttered
a
cry
and
the
glass
almost
fell
from
his
hands
immediately
running
to
the
room
in
which
cyrus
harding
then
was
he
extended
the
negative
and
magnifier
towards
the
engineer
pointing
out
the
little
spot
harding
examined
it
then
seizing
his
telescope
he
rushed
to
the
window
the
telescope
after
having
slowly
swept
the
horizon
at
last
stopped
on
the
lookedfor
spot
and
cyrus
harding
lowering
it
pronounced
one
word
only
a
vessel
and
in
fact
a
vessel
was
in
sight
off

it
was
now
two
years
and
a
half
since
the
castaways
from
the
balloon
had
been
thrown
on
lincoln
island
and
during
that
period
there
had
been
no
communication
between
them
and
their
fellowcreatures
once
the
reporter
had
attempted
to
communicate
with
the
inhabited
world
by
confiding
to
a
bird
a
letter
which
contained
the
secret
of
their
situation
but
that
was
a
chance
on
which
it
was
impossible
to
reckon
seriously
ayrton
alone
under
the
circumstances
which
have
been
related
had
come
to
join
the
little
colony
now
suddenly
on
this
day
the
17th
of
october
other
men
had
unexpectedly
appeared
in
sight
of
the
island
on
that
deserted
sea
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
a
vessel
was
there
but
would
she
pass
on
or
would
she
put
into
port
in
a
few
hours
the
colonists
would
definitely
know
what
to
expect
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
having
immediately
called
gideon
spilett
pencroft
and
neb
into
the
diningroom
of
granite
house
told
them
what
had
happened
pencroft
seizing
the
telescope
rapidly
swept
the
horizon
and
stopping
on
the
indicated
point
that
is
to
say
on
that
which
had
made
the
almost
imperceptible
spot
on
the
photographic
negative
im
blessed
but
it
is
really
a
vessel
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
which
did
not
express
any
great
amount
of
satisfaction
is
she
coming
here
asked
gideon
spilett
impossible
to
say
anything
yet
answered
pencroft
for
her
rigging
alone
is
above
the
horizon
and
not
a
bit
of
her
hull
can
be
seen
what
is
to
be
done
asked
the
lad
wait
replied
harding
and
for
a
considerable
time
the
settlers
remained
silent
given
up
to
all
the
thoughts
and
the
emotions
all
the
fears
all
the
hopes
which
were
aroused
by
this
incidentthe
most
important
which
had
occurred
since
their
arrival
in
lincoln
island
certainly
the
colonists
were
not
in
the
situation
of
castaways
abandoned
on
a
sterile
islet
constantly
contending
against
a
cruel
nature
for
their
miserable
existence
and
incessantly
tormented
by
the
longing
to
return
to
inhabited
countries
pencroft
and
neb
especially
who
felt
themselves
at
once
so
happy
and
so
rich
would
not
have
left
their
island
without
regret
they
were
accustomed
besides
to
this
new
life
in
the
midst
of
the
domain
which
their
intelligence
had
as
it
were
civilized
but
at
any
rate
this
ship
brought
news
from
the
world
perhaps
even
from
their
native
land
it
was
bringing
fellowcreatures
to
them
and
it
may
be
conceived
how
deeply
their
hearts
were
moved
at
the
sight
from
time
to
time
pencroft
took
the
glass
and
rested
himself
at
the
window
from
thence
he
very
attentively
examined
the
vessel
which
was
at
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
to
the
east
the
colonists
had
as
yet
therefore
no
means
of
signalizing
their
presence
a
flag
would
not
have
been
perceived
a
gun
would
not
have
been
heard
a
fire
would
not
have
been
visible
however
it
was
certain
that
the
island
overtopped
by
mount
franklin
could
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
vessels
lookout
but
why
was
the
ship
coming
there
was
it
simple
chance
which
brought
it
to
that
part
of
the
pacific
where
the
maps
mentioned
no
land
except
tabor
island
which
itself
was
out
of
the
route
usually
followed
by
vessels
from
the
polynesian
archipelagoes
from
new
zealand
and
from
the
american
coast
to
this
question
which
each
one
asked
himself
a
reply
was
suddenly
made
by
herbert
can
it
be
the
duncan
he
cried
the
duncan
as
has
been
said
was
lord
glenarvans
yacht
which
had
left
ayrton
on
the
islet
and
which
was
to
return
there
someday
to
fetch
him
now
the
islet
was
not
so
far
distant
from
lincoln
island
but
that
a
vessel
standing
for
the
one
could
pass
in
sight
of
the
other
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
only
separated
them
in
longitude
and
seventy
in
latitude
we
must
tell
ayrton
said
gideon
spilett
and
send
for
him
immediately
he
alone
can
say
if
it
is
the
duncan
this
was
the
opinion
of
all
and
the
reporter
going
to
the
telegraphic
apparatus
which
placed
the
corral
in
communication
with
granite
house
sent
this
telegramcome
with
all
possible
speed
in
a
few
minutes
the
bell
sounded
i
am
coming
replied
ayrton
then
the
settlers
continued
to
watch
the
vessel
if
it
is
the
duncan
said
herbert
ayrton
will
recognize
her
without
difficulty
since
he
sailed
on
board
her
for
some
time
and
if
he
recognizes
her
added
pencroft
it
will
agitate
him
exceedingly
yes
answered
cyrus
harding
but
now
ayrton
is
worthy
to
return
on
board
the
duncan
and
pray
heaven
that
it
is
indeed
lord
glenarvans
yacht
for
i
should
be
suspicious
of
any
other
vessel
these
are
illfamed
seas
and
i
have
always
feared
a
visit
from
malay
pirates
to
our
island
we
could
defend
it
cried
herbert
no
doubt
my
boy
answered
the
engineer
smiling
but
it
would
be
better
not
to
have
to
defend
it
a
useless
observation
said
spilett
lincoln
island
is
unknown
to
navigators
since
it
is
not
marked
even
on
the
most
recent
maps
do
you
think
cyrus
that
that
is
a
sufficient
motive
for
a
ship
finding
herself
unexpectedly
in
sight
of
new
land
to
try
and
visit
rather
than
avoid
it
certainly
replied
pencroft
i
think
so
too
added
the
engineer
it
may
even
be
said
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
captain
to
come
and
survey
any
land
or
island
not
yet
known
and
lincoln
island
is
in
this
position
well
said
pencroft
suppose
this
vessel
comes
and
anchors
there
a
few
cableslengths
from
our
island
what
shall
we
do
this
sudden
question
remained
at
first
without
any
reply
but
cyrus
harding
after
some
moments
thought
replied
in
the
calm
tone
which
was
usual
to
him
what
we
shall
do
my
friends
what
we
ought
to
do
is
thiswe
will
communicate
with
the
ship
we
will
take
our
passage
on
board
her
and
we
will
leave
our
island
after
having
taken
possession
of
it
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
then
we
will
return
with
any
who
may
wish
to
follow
us
to
colonize
it
definitely
and
endow
the
american
republic
with
a
useful
station
in
this
part
of
the
pacific
ocean
hurrah
exclaimed
pencroft
and
that
will
be
no
small
present
which
we
shall
make
to
our
country
the
colonization
is
already
almost
finished
names
are
given
to
every
part
of
the
island
there
is
a
natural
port
fresh
water
roads
a
telegraph
a
dockyard
and
manufactories
and
there
will
be
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
inscribe
lincoln
island
on
the
maps
but
if
anyone
seizes
it
in
our
absence
observed
gideon
spilett
hang
it
cried
the
sailor
i
would
rather
remain
all
alone
to
guard
it
and
trust
to
pencroft
they
shouldnt
steal
it
from
him
like
a
watch
from
the
pocket
of
a
swell
for
an
hour
it
was
impossible
to
say
with
any
certainty
whether
the
vessel
was
or
was
not
standing
towards
lincoln
island
she
was
nearer
but
in
what
direction
was
she
sailing
this
pencroft
could
not
determine
however
as
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
northeast
in
all
probability
the
vessel
was
sailing
on
the
starboard
tack
besides
the
wind
was
favorable
for
bringing
her
towards
the
island
and
the
sea
being
calm
she
would
not
be
afraid
to
approach
although
the
shallows
were
not
marked
on
the
chart
towards
four
oclockan
hour
after
he
had
been
sent
forayrton
arrived
at
granite
house
he
entered
the
diningroom
saying
at
your
service
gentlemen
cyrus
harding
gave
him
his
hand
as
was
his
custom
to
do
and
leading
him
to
the
window
ayrton
said
he
we
have
begged
you
to
come
here
for
an
important
reason
a
ship
is
in
sight
of
the
island
ayrton
at
first
paled
slightly
and
for
a
moment
his
eyes
became
dim
then
leaning
out
the
window
he
surveyed
the
horizon
but
could
see
nothing
take
this
telescope
said
spilett
and
look
carefully
ayrton
for
it
is
possible
that
this
ship
may
be
the
duncan
come
to
these
seas
for
the
purpose
of
taking
you
home
again
the
duncan
murmured
ayrton
already
this
last
word
escaped
ayrtons
lips
as
if
involuntarily
and
his
head
drooped
upon
his
hands
did
not
twelve
years
solitude
on
a
desert
island
appear
to
him
a
sufficient
expiation
did
not
the
penitent
yet
feel
himself
pardoned
either
in
his
own
eyes
or
in
the
eyes
of
others
no
said
he
no
it
cannot
be
the
duncan
look
ayrton
then
said
the
engineer
for
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
know
beforehand
what
to
expect
ayrton
took
the
glass
and
pointed
it
in
the
direction
indicated
during
some
minutes
he
examined
the
horizon
without
moving
without
uttering
a
word
then
it
is
indeed
a
vessel
said
he
but
i
do
not
think
she
is
the
duncan
why
do
you
not
think
so
asked
gideon
spilett
because
the
duncan
is
a
steamyacht
and
i
cannot
perceive
any
trace
of
smoke
either
above
or
near
that
vessel
perhaps
she
is
simply
sailing
observed
pencroft
the
wind
is
favorable
for
the
direction
which
she
appears
to
be
taking
and
she
may
be
anxious
to
economize
her
coal
being
so
far
from
land
it
is
possible
that
you
may
be
right
mr
pencroft
answered
ayrton
and
that
the
vessel
has
extinguished
her
fires
we
must
wait
until
she
is
nearer
and
then
we
shall
soon
know
what
to
expect
so
saying
ayrton
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
remained
silent
the
colonists
again
discussed
the
strange
ship
but
ayrton
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
all
were
in
such
a
mood
that
they
found
it
impossible
to
continue
their
work
gideon
spilett
and
pencroft
were
particularly
nervous
going
coming
not
able
to
remain
still
in
one
place
herbert
felt
more
curiosity
neb
alone
maintained
his
usual
calm
manner
was
not
his
country
that
where
his
master
was
as
to
the
engineer
he
remained
plunged
in
deep
thought
and
in
his
heart
feared
rather
than
desired
the
arrival
of
the
ship
in
the
meanwhile
the
vessel
was
a
little
nearer
the
island
with
the
aid
of
the
glass
it
was
ascertained
that
she
was
a
brig
and
not
one
of
those
malay
proas
which
are
generally
used
by
the
pirates
of
the
pacific
it
was
therefore
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
engineers
apprehensions
would
not
be
justified
and
that
the
presence
of
this
vessel
in
the
vicinity
of
the
island
was
fraught
with
no
danger
pencroft
after
a
minute
examination
was
able
positively
to
affirm
that
the
vessel
was
rigged
as
a
brig
and
that
she
was
standing
obliquely
towards
the
coast
on
the
starboard
tack
under
her
topsails
and
topgallantsails
this
was
confirmed
by
ayrton
but
by
continuing
in
this
direction
she
must
soon
disappear
behind
claw
cape
as
the
wind
was
from
the
southwest
and
to
watch
her
it
would
be
then
necessary
to
ascend
the
height
of
washington
bay
near
port
balloona
provoking
circumstance
for
it
was
already
five
oclock
in
the
evening
and
the
twilight
would
soon
make
any
observation
extremely
difficult
what
shall
we
do
when
night
comes
on
asked
gideon
spilett
shall
we
light
a
fire
so
as
to
signal
our
presence
on
the
coast
this
was
a
serious
question
and
yet
although
the
engineer
still
retained
some
of
his
presentiments
it
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
during
the
night
the
ship
might
disappear
and
leave
for
ever
and
this
ship
gone
would
another
ever
return
to
the
waters
of
lincoln
island
who
could
foresee
what
the
future
would
then
have
in
store
for
the
colonists
yes
said
the
reporter
we
ought
to
make
known
to
that
vessel
whoever
she
may
be
that
the
island
is
inhabited
to
neglect
the
opportunity
which
is
offered
to
us
might
be
to
create
everlasting
regrets
it
was
therefore
decided
that
neb
and
pencroft
should
go
to
port
balloon
and
that
there
at
nightfall
they
should
light
an
immense
fire
the
blaze
of
which
would
necessarily
attract
the
attention
of
the
brig
but
at
the
moment
when
neb
and
the
sailor
were
preparing
to
leave
granite
house
the
vessel
suddenly
altered
her
course
and
stood
directly
for
union
bay
the
brig
was
a
good
sailer
for
she
approached
rapidly
neb
and
pencroft
put
off
their
departure
therefore
and
the
glass
was
put
into
ayrtons
hands
that
he
might
ascertain
for
certain
whether
the
ship
was
or
was
not
the
duncan
the
scotch
yacht
was
also
rigged
as
a
brig
the
question
was
whether
a
chimney
could
be
discerned
between
the
two
masts
of
the
vessel
which
was
now
at
a
distance
of
only
five
miles
the
horizon
was
still
very
clear
the
examination
was
easy
and
ayrton
soon
let
the
glass
fall
again
saying
it
is
not
the
duncan
it
could
not
be
pencroft
again
brought
the
brig
within
the
range
of
the
telescope
and
could
see
that
she
was
of
between
three
and
four
hundred
tons
burden
wonderfully
narrow
wellmasted
admirably
built
and
must
be
a
very
rapid
sailer
but
to
what
nation
did
she
belong
that
was
difficult
to
say
and
yet
added
the
sailor
a
flag
is
floating
from
her
peak
but
i
cannot
distinguish
the
colors
of
it
in
half
an
hour
we
shall
be
certain
about
that
answered
the
reporter
besides
it
is
very
evident
that
the
intention
of
the
captain
of
this
ship
is
to
land
and
consequently
if
not
today
tomorrow
at
the
latest
we
shall
make
his
acquaintance
never
mind
said
pencroft
it
is
best
to
know
whom
we
have
to
deal
with
and
i
shall
not
be
sorry
to
recognize
that
fellows
colors
and
while
thus
speaking
the
sailor
never
left
the
glass
the
day
began
to
fade
and
with
the
day
the
breeze
fell
also
the
brigs
ensign
hung
in
folds
and
it
became
more
and
more
difficult
to
observe
it
it
is
not
the
american
flag
said
pencroft
from
time
to
time
nor
the
english
the
red
of
which
could
be
easily
seen
nor
the
french
or
german
colors
nor
the
white
flag
of
russia
nor
the
yellow
of
spain
one
would
say
it
was
all
one
color
lets
see
in
these
seas
what
do
we
generally
meet
with
the
chilean
flagbut
that
is
tricolor
brazilianit
is
green
japaneseit
is
yellow
and
black
while
this
at
that
moment
the
breeze
blew
out
the
unknown
flag
ayrton
seizing
the
telescope
which
the
sailor
had
put
down
put
it
to
his
eye
and
in
a
hoarse
voice
the
black
flag
he
exclaimed
and
indeed
the
somber
bunting
was
floating
from
the
mast
of
the
brig
and
they
had
now
good
reason
for
considering
her
to
be
a
suspicious
vessel
had
the
engineer
then
been
right
in
his
presentiments
was
this
a
pirate
vessel
did
she
scour
the
pacific
competing
with
the
malay
proas
which
still
infest
it
for
what
had
she
come
to
look
at
the
shores
of
lincoln
island
was
it
to
them
an
unknown
island
ready
to
become
a
magazine
for
stolen
cargoes
had
she
come
to
find
on
the
coast
a
sheltered
port
for
the
winter
months
was
the
settlers
honest
domain
destined
to
be
transformed
into
an
infamous
refugethe
headquarters
of
the
piracy
of
the
pacific
all
these
ideas
instinctively
presented
themselves
to
the
colonists
imaginations
there
was
no
doubt
besides
of
the
signification
which
must
be
attached
to
the
color
of
the
hoisted
flag
it
was
that
of
pirates
it
was
that
which
the
duncan
would
have
carried
had
the
convicts
succeeded
in
their
criminal
design
no
time
was
lost
before
discussing
it
my
friends
said
cyrus
harding
perhaps
this
vessel
only
wishes
to
survey
the
coast
of
the
island
perhaps
her
crew
will
not
land
there
is
a
chance
of
it
however
that
may
be
we
ought
to
do
everything
we
can
to
hide
our
presence
here
the
windmill
on
prospect
heights
is
too
easily
seen
let
ayrton
and
neb
go
and
take
down
the
sails
we
must
also
conceal
the
windows
of
granite
house
with
thick
branches
all
the
fires
must
be
extinguished
so
that
nothing
may
betray
the
presence
of
men
on
the
island
and
our
vessel
said
herbert
oh
answered
pencroft
she
is
sheltered
in
port
balloon
and
i
defy
any
of
those
rascals
there
to
find
her
the
engineers
orders
were
immediately
executed
neb
and
ayrton
ascended
the
plateau
and
took
the
necessary
precautions
to
conceal
any
indication
of
a
settlement
while
they
were
thus
occupied
their
companions
went
to
the
border
of
jacamar
wood
and
brought
back
a
large
quantity
of
branches
and
creepers
which
would
at
some
distance
appear
as
natural
foliage
and
thus
disguise
the
windows
in
the
granite
cliff
at
the
same
time
the
ammunition
and
guns
were
placed
ready
so
as
to
be
at
hand
in
case
of
an
unexpected
attack
when
all
these
precautions
had
been
taken
my
friends
said
harding
and
his
voice
betrayed
some
emotion
if
the
wretches
endeavor
to
seize
lincoln
island
we
shall
defend
itshall
we
not
yes
cyrus
replied
the
reporter
and
if
necessary
we
will
die
to
defend
it
the
engineer
extended
his
hand
to
his
companions
who
pressed
it
warmly
ayrton
remained
in
his
corner
not
joining
the
colonists
perhaps
he
the
former
convict
still
felt
himself
unworthy
to
do
so
cyrus
harding
understood
what
was
passing
in
ayrtons
mind
and
going
to
him
and
you
ayrton
he
asked
what
will
you
do
my
duty
answered
ayrton
he
then
took
up
his
station
near
the
window
and
gazed
through
the
foliage
it
was
now
halfpast
seven
the
sun
had
disappeared
twenty
minutes
ago
behind
granite
house
consequently
the
eastern
horizon
was
becoming
obscured
in
the
meanwhile
the
brig
continued
to
advance
towards
union
bay
she
was
now
not
more
than
two
miles
off
and
exactly
opposite
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
for
after
having
tacked
off
claw
cape
she
had
drifted
towards
the
north
in
the
current
of
the
rising
tide
one
might
have
said
that
at
this
distance
she
had
already
entered
the
vast
bay
for
a
straight
line
drawn
from
claw
cape
to
cape
mandible
would
have
rested
on
her
starboard
quarter
was
the
brig
about
to
penetrate
far
into
the
bay
that
was
the
first
question
when
once
in
the
bay
would
she
anchor
there
that
was
the
second
would
she
not
content
herself
with
only
surveying
the
coast
and
stand
out
to
sea
again
without
landing
her
crew
they
would
know
this
in
an
hour
the
colonists
could
do
nothing
but
wait
cyrus
harding
had
not
seen
the
suspected
vessel
hoist
the
black
flag
without
deep
anxiety
was
it
not
a
direct
menace
against
the
work
which
he
and
his
companions
had
till
now
conducted
so
successfully
had
these
piratesfor
the
sailors
of
the
brig
could
be
nothing
elsealready
visited
the
island
since
on
approaching
it
they
had
hoisted
their
colors
had
they
formerly
invaded
it
so
that
certain
unaccountable
peculiarities
might
be
explained
in
this
way
did
there
exist
in
the
as
yet
unexplored
parts
some
accomplice
ready
to
enter
into
communication
with
them
to
all
these
questions
which
he
mentally
asked
himself
harding
knew
not
what
to
reply
but
he
felt
that
the
safety
of
the
colony
could
not
but
be
seriously
threatened
by
the
arrival
of
the
brig
however
he
and
his
companions
were
determined
to
fight
to
the
last
gasp
it
would
have
been
very
important
to
know
if
the
pirates
were
numerous
and
better
armed
than
the
colonists
but
how
was
this
information
to
be
obtained
night
fell
the
new
moon
had
disappeared
profound
darkness
enveloped
the
island
and
the
sea
no
light
could
pierce
through
the
heavy
piles
of
clouds
on
the
horizon
the
wind
had
died
away
completely
with
the
twilight
not
a
leaf
rustled
on
the
trees
not
a
ripple
murmured
on
the
shore
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
ship
all
her
lights
being
extinguished
and
if
she
was
still
in
sight
of
the
island
her
whereabouts
could
not
be
discovered
well
who
knows
said
pencroft
perhaps
that
cursed
craft
will
stand
off
during
the
night
and
we
shall
see
nothing
of
her
at
daybreak
as
if
in
reply
to
the
sailors
observation
a
bright
light
flashed
in
the
darkness
and
a
cannonshot
was
heard
the
vessel
was
still
there
and
had
guns
on
board
six
seconds
elapsed
between
the
flash
and
the
report
therefore
the
brig
was
about
a
mile
and
a
quarter
from
the
coast
at
the
same
time
the
chains
were
heard
rattling
through
the
hawseholes
the
vessel
had
just
anchored
in
sight
of
granite
house
chapter
2
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
as
to
the
pirates
intentions
they
had
dropped
anchor
at
a
short
distance
from
the
island
and
it
was
evident
that
the
next
day
by
means
of
their
boats
they
purposed
to
land
on
the
beach
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
were
ready
to
act
but
determined
though
they
were
they
must
not
forget
to
be
prudent
perhaps
their
presence
might
still
be
concealed
in
the
event
of
the
pirates
contenting
themselves
with
landing
on
the
shore
without
examining
the
interior
of
the
island
it
might
be
indeed
that
their
only
intention
was
to
obtain
fresh
water
from
the
mercy
and
it
was
not
impossible
that
the
bridge
thrown
across
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
mouth
and
the
manufactory
at
the
chimneys
might
escape
their
notice
but
why
was
that
flag
hoisted
at
the
brigs
peak
what
was
that
shot
fired
for
pure
bravado
doubtless
unless
it
was
a
sign
of
the
act
of
taking
possession
harding
knew
now
that
the
vessel
was
well
armed
and
what
had
the
colonists
of
lincoln
island
to
reply
to
the
pirates
guns
a
few
muskets
only
however
observed
cyrus
harding
here
we
are
in
an
impregnable
position
the
enemy
cannot
discover
the
mouth
of
the
outlet
now
that
it
is
hidden
under
reeds
and
grass
and
consequently
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
penetrate
into
granite
house
but
our
plantations
our
poultryyard
our
corral
all
everything
exclaimed
pencroft
stamping
his
foot
they
may
spoil
everything
destroy
everything
in
a
few
hours
everything
pencroft
answered
harding
and
we
have
no
means
of
preventing
them
are
they
numerous
that
is
the
question
said
the
reporter
if
they
are
not
more
than
a
dozen
we
shall
be
able
to
stop
them
but
forty
fifty
more
perhaps
captain
harding
then
said
ayrton
advancing
towards
the
engineer
will
you
give
me
leave
for
what
my
friend
to
go
to
that
vessel
to
find
out
the
strength
of
her
crew
but
ayrton
answered
the
engineer
hesitating
you
will
risk
your
life
why
not
sir
that
is
more
than
your
duty
i
have
more
than
my
duty
to
do
replied
ayrton
will
you
go
to
the
ship
in
the
boat
asked
gideon
spilett
no
sir
but
i
will
swim
a
boat
would
be
seen
where
a
man
may
glide
between
wind
and
water
do
you
know
that
the
brig
is
a
mile
and
a
quarter
from
the
shore
said
herbert
i
am
a
good
swimmer
mr
herbert
i
tell
you
it
is
risking
your
life
said
the
engineer
that
is
no
matter
answered
ayrton
captain
harding
i
ask
this
as
a
favor
perhaps
it
will
be
a
means
of
raising
me
in
my
own
eyes
go
ayrton
replied
the
engineer
who
felt
sure
that
a
refusal
would
have
deeply
wounded
the
former
convict
now
become
an
honest
man
i
will
accompany
you
said
pencroft
you
mistrust
me
said
ayrton
quickly
then
more
humbly
alas
no
no
exclaimed
harding
with
animation
no
ayrton
pencroft
does
not
mistrust
you
you
interpret
his
words
wrongly
indeed
returned
the
sailor
i
only
propose
to
accompany
ayrton
as
far
as
the
islet
it
may
be
although
it
is
scarcely
possible
that
one
of
these
villains
has
landed
and
in
that
case
two
men
will
not
be
too
many
to
hinder
him
from
giving
the
alarm
i
will
wait
for
ayrton
on
the
islet
and
he
shall
go
alone
to
the
vessel
since
he
has
proposed
to
do
so
these
things
agreed
to
ayrton
made
preparations
for
his
departure
his
plan
was
bold
but
it
might
succeed
thanks
to
the
darkness
of
the
night
once
arrived
at
the
vessels
side
ayrton
holding
on
to
the
main
chains
might
reconnoiter
the
number
and
perhaps
overhear
the
intentions
of
the
pirates
ayrton
and
pencroft
followed
by
their
companions
descended
to
the
beach
ayrton
undressed
and
rubbed
himself
with
grease
so
as
to
suffer
less
from
the
temperature
of
the
water
which
was
still
cold
he
might
indeed
be
obliged
to
remain
in
it
for
several
hours
pencroft
and
neb
during
this
time
had
gone
to
fetch
the
boat
moored
a
few
hundred
feet
higher
up
on
the
bank
of
the
mercy
and
by
the
time
they
returned
ayrton
was
ready
to
start
a
coat
was
thrown
over
his
shoulders
and
the
settlers
all
came
round
him
to
press
his
hand
ayrton
then
shoved
off
with
pencroft
in
the
boat
it
was
halfpast
ten
in
the
evening
when
the
two
adventurers
disappeared
in
the
darkness
their
companions
returned
to
wait
at
the
chimneys
the
channel
was
easily
traversed
and
the
boat
touched
the
opposite
shore
of
the
islet
this
was
not
done
without
precaution
for
fear
lest
the
pirates
might
be
roaming
about
there
but
after
a
careful
survey
it
was
evident
that
the
islet
was
deserted
ayrton
then
followed
by
pencroft
crossed
it
with
a
rapid
step
scaring
the
birds
nestled
in
the
holes
of
the
rocks
then
without
hesitating
he
plunged
into
the
sea
and
swam
noiselessly
in
the
direction
of
the
ship
in
which
a
few
lights
had
recently
appeared
showing
her
exact
situation
as
to
pencroft
he
crouched
down
in
a
cleft
of
the
rock
and
awaited
the
return
of
his
companion
in
the
meanwhile
ayrton
swimming
with
a
vigorous
stroke
glided
through
the
sheet
of
water
without
producing
the
slightest
ripple
his
head
just
emerged
above
it
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
dark
hull
of
the
brig
from
which
the
lights
were
reflected
in
the
water
he
thought
only
of
the
duty
which
he
had
promised
to
accomplish
and
nothing
of
the
danger
which
he
ran
not
only
on
board
the
ship
but
in
the
sea
often
frequented
by
sharks
the
current
bore
him
along
and
he
rapidly
receded
from
the
shore
half
an
hour
afterwards
ayrton
without
having
been
either
seen
or
heard
arrived
at
the
ship
and
caught
hold
of
the
mainchains
he
took
breath
then
hoisting
himself
up
he
managed
to
reach
the
extremity
of
the
cutwater
there
were
drying
several
pairs
of
sailors
trousers
he
put
on
a
pair
then
settling
himself
firmly
he
listened
they
were
not
sleeping
on
board
the
brig
on
the
contrary
they
were
talking
singing
laughing
and
these
were
the
sentences
accompanied
with
oaths
which
principally
struck
ayrton
our
brig
is
a
famous
acquisition
she
sails
well
and
merits
her
name
of
the
speedy
she
would
show
all
the
navy
of
norfolk
a
clean
pair
of
heels
hurrah
for
her
captain
hurrah
for
bob
harvey
what
ayrton
felt
when
he
overheard
this
fragment
of
conversation
may
be
understood
when
it
is
known
that
in
this
bob
harvey
he
recognized
one
of
his
old
australian
companions
a
daring
sailor
who
had
continued
his
criminal
career
bob
harvey
had
seized
on
the
shores
of
norfolk
island
this
brig
which
was
loaded
with
arms
ammunition
utensils
and
tools
of
all
sorts
destined
for
one
of
the
sandwich
islands
all
his
gang
had
gone
on
board
and
pirates
after
having
been
convicts
these
wretches
more
ferocious
than
the
malays
themselves
scoured
the
pacific
destroying
vessels
and
massacring
their
crews
the
convicts
spoke
loudly
they
recounted
their
deeds
drinking
deeply
at
the
same
time
and
this
is
what
ayrton
gathered
the
actual
crew
of
the
speedy
was
composed
solely
of
english
prisoners
escaped
from
norfolk
island
here
it
may
be
well
to
explain
what
this
island
was
in
29deg
2
south
latitude
and
165deg
42
east
longitude
to
the
east
of
australia
is
found
a
little
island
six
miles
in
circumference
overlooked
by
mount
pitt
which
rises
to
a
height
of
1100
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
this
is
norfolk
island
once
the
seat
of
an
establishment
in
which
were
lodged
the
most
intractable
convicts
from
the
english
penitentiaries
they
numbered
500
under
an
iron
discipline
threatened
with
terrible
punishments
and
were
guarded
by
150
soldiers
and
150
employed
under
the
orders
of
the
governor
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
collection
of
greater
ruffians
sometimesalthough
very
rarelynotwithstanding
the
extreme
surveillance
of
which
they
were
the
object
many
managed
to
escape
and
seizing
vessels
which
they
surprised
they
infested
the
polynesian
archipelagoes
thus
had
bob
harvey
and
his
companions
done
thus
had
ayrton
formerly
wished
to
do
bob
harvey
had
seized
the
brig
speedy
anchored
in
sight
of
norfolk
island
the
crew
had
been
massacred
and
for
a
year
this
ship
had
scoured
the
pacific
under
the
command
of
harvey
now
a
pirate
and
well
known
to
ayrton
the
convicts
were
for
the
most
part
assembled
under
the
poop
but
a
few
stretched
on
the
deck
were
talking
loudly
the
conversation
still
continued
amid
shouts
and
libations
ayrton
learned
that
chance
alone
had
brought
the
speedy
in
sight
of
lincoln
island
bob
harvey
had
never
yet
set
foot
on
it
but
as
cyrus
harding
had
conjectured
finding
this
unknown
land
in
his
course
its
position
being
marked
on
no
chart
he
had
formed
the
project
of
visiting
it
and
if
he
found
it
suitable
of
making
it
the
brigs
headquarters
as
to
the
black
flag
hoisted
at
the
speedys
peak
and
the
gun
which
had
been
fired
in
imitation
of
menofwar
when
they
lower
their
colors
it
was
pure
piratical
bravado
it
was
in
no
way
a
signal
and
no
communication
yet
existed
between
the
convicts
and
lincoln
island
the
settlers
domain
was
now
menaced
with
terrible
danger
evidently
the
island
with
its
water
its
harbor
its
resources
of
all
kinds
so
increased
in
value
by
the
colonists
and
the
concealment
afforded
by
granite
house
could
not
but
be
convenient
for
the
convicts
in
their
hands
it
would
become
an
excellent
place
of
refuge
and
being
unknown
it
would
assure
them
for
a
long
time
perhaps
impunity
and
security
evidently
also
the
lives
of
the
settlers
would
not
be
respected
and
bob
harvey
and
his
accomplices
first
care
would
be
to
massacre
them
without
mercy
harding
and
his
companions
had
therefore
not
even
the
choice
of
flying
and
hiding
themselves
in
the
island
since
the
convicts
intended
to
reside
there
and
since
in
the
event
of
the
speedy
departing
on
an
expedition
it
was
probable
that
some
of
the
crew
would
remain
on
shore
so
as
to
settle
themselves
there
therefore
it
would
be
necessary
to
fight
to
destroy
every
one
of
these
scoundrels
unworthy
of
pity
and
against
whom
any
means
would
be
right
so
thought
ayrton
and
he
well
knew
that
cyrus
harding
would
be
of
his
way
of
thinking
but
was
resistance
and
in
the
last
place
victory
possible
that
would
depend
on
the
equipment
of
the
brig
and
the
number
of
men
which
she
carried
this
ayrton
resolved
to
learn
at
any
cost
and
as
an
hour
after
his
arrival
the
vociferations
had
begun
to
die
away
and
as
a
large
number
of
the
convicts
were
already
buried
in
a
drunken
sleep
ayrton
did
not
hesitate
to
venture
onto
the
speedys
deck
which
the
extinguished
lanterns
now
left
in
total
darkness
he
hoisted
himself
onto
the
cutwater
and
by
the
bowsprit
arrived
at
the
forecastle
then
gliding
among
the
convicts
stretched
here
and
there
he
made
the
round
of
the
ship
and
found
that
the
speedy
carried
four
guns
which
would
throw
shot
of
from
eight
to
ten
pounds
in
weight
he
found
also
on
touching
them
that
these
guns
were
breechloaders
they
were
therefore
of
modern
make
easily
used
and
of
terrible
effect
as
to
the
men
lying
on
the
deck
they
were
about
ten
in
number
but
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
more
were
sleeping
down
below
besides
by
listening
to
them
ayrton
had
understood
that
there
were
fifty
on
board
that
was
a
large
number
for
the
six
settlers
of
lincoln
island
to
contend
with
but
now
thanks
to
ayrtons
devotion
cyrus
harding
would
not
be
surprised
he
would
know
the
strength
of
his
adversaries
and
would
make
his
arrangements
accordingly
there
was
nothing
more
for
ayrton
to
do
but
to
return
and
render
to
his
companions
an
account
of
the
mission
with
which
he
had
charged
himself
and
he
prepared
to
regain
the
bows
of
the
brig
so
that
he
might
let
himself
down
into
the
water
but
to
this
man
whose
wish
was
as
he
had
said
to
do
more
than
his
duty
there
came
an
heroic
thought
this
was
to
sacrifice
his
own
life
but
save
the
island
and
the
colonists
cyrus
harding
evidently
could
not
resist
fifty
ruffians
all
well
armed
who
either
by
penetrating
by
main
force
into
granite
house
or
by
starving
out
the
besieged
could
obtain
from
them
what
they
wanted
and
then
he
thought
of
his
preserversthose
who
had
made
him
again
a
man
and
an
honest
mm
those
to
whom
he
owed
allmurdered
without
pity
their
works
destroyed
their
island
turned
into
a
pirates
den
he
said
to
himself
that
he
ayrton
was
the
principal
cause
of
so
many
disasters
since
his
old
companion
bob
harvey
had
but
realized
his
own
plans
and
a
feeling
of
horror
took
possession
of
him
then
he
was
seized
with
an
irresistible
desire
to
blow
up
the
brig
and
with
her
all
whom
she
had
on
board
he
would
perish
in
the
explosion
but
he
would
have
done
his
duty
ayrton
did
not
hesitate
to
reach
the
powderroom
which
is
always
situated
in
the
afterpart
of
a
vessel
was
easy
there
would
be
no
want
of
powder
in
a
vessel
which
followed
such
a
trade
and
a
spark
would
be
enough
to
destroy
it
in
an
instant
ayrton
stole
carefully
along
the
betweendecks
strewn
with
numerous
sleepers
overcome
more
by
drunkenness
than
sleep
a
lantern
was
lighted
at
the
foot
of
the
mainmast
round
which
was
hung
a
gunrack
furnished
with
weapons
of
all
sorts
ayrton
took
a
revolver
from
the
rack
and
assured
himself
that
it
was
loaded
and
primed
nothing
more
was
needed
to
accomplish
the
work
of
destruction
he
then
glided
towards
the
stern
so
as
to
arrive
under
the
brigs
poop
at
the
powdermagazine
it
was
difficult
to
proceed
along
the
dimly
lighted
deck
without
stumbling
over
some
halfsleeping
convict
who
retorted
by
oaths
and
kicks
ayrton
was
therefore
more
than
once
obliged
to
halt
but
at
last
he
arrived
at
the
partition
dividing
the
aftercabin
and
found
the
door
opening
into
the
magazine
itself
ayrton
compelled
to
force
it
open
set
to
work
it
was
a
difficult
operation
to
perform
without
noise
for
he
had
to
break
a
padlock
but
under
his
vigorous
hand
the
padlock
broke
and
the
door
was
open
at
that
moment
a
hand
was
laid
on
ayrtons
shoulder
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
a
tall
man
in
a
harsh
voice
who
standing
in
the
shadow
quickly
threw
the
light
of
a
lantern
in
ayrtons
face
ayrton
drew
back
in
the
rapid
flash
of
the
lantern
he
had
recognized
his
former
accomplice
bob
harvey
who
could
not
have
known
him
as
he
must
have
thought
ayrton
long
since
dead
what
are
you
doing
here
again
said
bob
harvey
seizing
ayrton
by
the
waistband
but
ayrton
without
replying
wrenched
himself
from
his
grasp
and
attempted
to
rush
into
the
magazine
a
shot
fired
into
the
midst
of
the
powdercasks
and
all
would
be
over
help
lads
shouted
bob
harvey
at
his
shout
two
or
three
pirates
awoke
jumped
up
and
rushing
on
ayrton
endeavored
to
throw
him
down
he
soon
extricated
himself
from
their
grasp
he
fired
his
revolver
and
two
of
the
convicts
fell
but
a
blow
from
a
knife
which
he
could
not
ward
off
made
a
gash
in
his
shoulder
ayrton
perceived
that
he
could
no

bob
harvey
had
reclosed
the
door
of
the
powdermagazine
and
a
movement
on
the
deck
indicated
a
general
awakening
of
the
pirates

reserve
himself
to
fight
at

was
nothing
for
him
but
flight
but
was
flight
still
possible
it
was
doubtful
yet
ayrton
resolved
to
dare
everything
in
order
to
rejoin
his
companions
four
barrels
of
the
revolver
were
still
undischarged

were
firedone
aimed
at
bob
harvey
did
not
wound
him
or
at
any
rate
only
slightly
and
ayrton
profiting
by
the
momentary
retreat
of
his
adversaries
rushed
towards
the
companionladder
to
gain
the
deck
passing
before
the
lantern
he
smashed
it
with
a
blow
from
the
butt
of
his
revolver
a
profound
darkness
ensued
which
favored
his
flight
two
or
three
pirates
awakened
by
the
noise
were
descending
the
ladder
at
the
same
moment
a
fifth
shot
from
ayrton
laid
one
low
and
the
others
drew
back
not
understanding
what
was
going
on
ayrton
was
on
deck
in
two
bounds
and
three
seconds
later
having
discharged
his
last
barrel
in
the
face
of
a
pirate
who
was
about
to
seize
him
by
the
throat
he
leaped
over
the
bulwarks
into
the
sea
ayrton
had
not
made
six
strokes
before
shots
were
splashing
around
him

the

and

crouched
in
the
chimneys
when
they
heard
the
reports
on
board
the
brig
they
rushed
out
on
to
the
beach
and
their
guns
shouldered
they
stood
ready
to
repel

they
had
no

about
it
themselves
ayrton
surprised
by
the
pirates

been
murdered
and
perhaps
the
wretches
would
profit
by
the
night
to
make
a
descent
on
the
island
half
an
hour
was
passed
in
terrible
anxiety
the
firing
had
ceased
and
yet
neither
ayrton
nor
pencroft
had
reappeared
was
the
islet
invaded
ought
they
not
to
fly
to
the
help
of
ayrton
and
pencroft
but
how
the
tide
being
high
at
that
time
rendered
the
channel
impassable
the
boat
was
not
there
we
may
imagine
the
horrible
anxiety
which
took
possession
of
harding
and
his
companions
at
last
towards
halfpast
twelve
a
boat
carrying
two
men
touched
the

it

slightly
wounded
in
the

and

safe
and
sound
whom
their
friends
received
with
open
arms
all
immediately
took
refuge
in
the
chimneys
there
ayrton
recounted
all
that
had
passed
even
to
his
plan
for
blowing
up
the

chapter
3
the
night
passed
without
incident
the
colonists
were
on
the
qui
vive
and
did
not
leave
their
post
at
the
chimneys
the
pirates
on
their
side
did
not
appear
to
have
made
any
attempt
to
land
since
the
last
shots
fired
at
ayrton
not
a
report
not
even
a
sound
had
betrayed
the
presence
of
the
brig
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
island
it
might
have
been
fancied
that
she
had
weighed
anchor
thinking
that
she
had
to
deal
with
her
match
and
had
left
the
coast
but
it
was
no
such
thing
and
when
day
began
to
dawn
the
settlers
could
see
a
confused
mass
through
the
morning
mist
it
was
the
speedy
these
my
friends
said
the
engineer
are
the
arrangements
which
appear
to
me
best
to
make
before
the
fog
completely
clears
away
it
hides
us
from
the
eyes
of
the
pirates
and
we
can
act
without
attracting
their
attention
the
most
important
thing
is
that
the
convicts
should
believe
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
are
numerous
and
consequently
capable
of
resisting
them
i
therefore
propose
that
we
divide
into
three
parties
the
first
of
which
shall
be
posted
at
the
chimneys
the
second
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
as
to
the
third
i
think
it
would
be
best
to
place
it
on
the
islet
so
as
to
prevent
or
at
all
events
delay
any
attempt
at
landing
we
have
the
use
of
two
rifles
and
four
muskets
each
of
us
will
be
armed
and
as
we
are
amply
provided
with
powder
and
shot
we
need
not
spare
our
fire
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
muskets
nor
even
from
the
guns
of
the
brig
what
can
they
do
against
these
rocks
and
as
we
shall
not
fire
from
the
windows
of
granite
house
the
pirates
will
not
think
of
causing
irreparable
damage
by
throwing
shell
against
it
what
is
to
be
feared
is
the
necessity
of
meeting
handtohand
since
the
convicts
have
numbers
on
their
side
we
must
therefore
try
to
prevent
them
from
landing
but
without
discovering
ourselves
therefore
do
not
economize
the
ammunition
fire
often
but
with
a
sure
aim
we
have
each
eight
or
ten
enemies
to
kill
and
they
must
be
killed
cyrus
harding
had
clearly
represented
their
situation
although
he
spoke
in
the
calmest
voice
as
if
it
was
a
question
of
directing
a
piece
of
work
and
not
ordering
a
battle
his
companions
approved
these
arrangements
without
even
uttering
a
word
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
but
for
each
to
take
his
place
before
the
fog
should
be
completely
dissipated
neb
and
pencroft
immediately
ascended
to
granite
house
and
brought
back
a
sufficient
quantity
of
ammunition
gideon
spilett
and
ayrton
both
very
good
marksmen
were
armed
with
the
two
rifles
which
carried
nearly
a
mile
the
four
other
muskets
were
divided
among
harding
neb
pencroft
and
herbert
the
posts
were
arranged
in
the
following
manner
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
remained
in
ambush
at
the
chimneys
thus
commanding
the
shore
to
the
foot
of
granite
house
gideon
spilett
and
neb
crouched
among
the
rocks
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
from
which
the
drawbridges
had
been
raised
so
as
to
prevent
any
one
from
crossing
in
a
boat
or
landing
on
the
opposite
shore
as
to
ayrton
and
pencroft
they
shoved
off
in
the
boat
and
prepared
to
cross
the
channel
and
to
take
up
two
separate
stations
on
the
islet
in
this
way
shots
being
fired
from
four
different
points
at
once
the
convicts
would
be
led
to
believe
that
the
island
was
both
largely
peopled
and
strongly
defended
in
the
event
of
a
landing
being
effected
without
their
having
been
able
to
prevent
it
and
also
if
they
saw
that
they
were
on
the
point
of
being
cut
off
by
the
brigs
boat
ayrton
and
pencroft
were
to
return
in
their
boat
to
the
shore
and
proceed
towards
the
threatened
spot
before
starting
to
occupy
their
posts
the
colonists
for
the
last
time
wrung
each
others
hands
pencroft
succeeded
in
controlling
himself
sufficiently
to
suppress
his
emotion
when
he
embraced
herbert
his
boy
and
then
they
separated
in
a
few
moments
harding
and
herbert
on
one
side
the
reporter
and
neb
on
the
other
had
disappeared
behind
the
rocks
and
five
minutes
later
ayrton
and
pencroft
having
without
difficulty
crossed
the
channel
disembarked
on
the
islet
and
concealed
themselves
in
the
clefts
of
its
eastern
shore
none
of
them
could
have
been
seen
for
they
themselves
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
brig
in
the
fog
it
was
halfpast
six
in
the
morning
soon
the
fog
began
to
clear
away
and
the
topmasts
of
the
brig
issued
from
the
vapor
for
some
minutes
great
masses
rolled
over
the
surface
of
the
sea
then
a
breeze
sprang
up
which
rapidly
dispelled
the
mist
the
speedy
now
appeared
in
full
view
with
a
spring
on
her
cable
her
head
to
the
north
presenting
her
larboard
side
to
the
island
just
as
harding
had
calculated
she
was
not
more
than
a
mile
and
a
quarter
from
the
coast
the
sinister
black
flag
floated
from
the
peak
the
engineer
with
his
telescope
could
see
that
the
four
guns
on
board
were
pointed
at
the
island
they
were
evidently
ready
to
fire
at
a
moments
notice
in
the
meanwhile
the
speedy
remained
silent
about
thirty
pirates
could
be
seen
moving
on
the
deck
a
few
more
on
the
poop
two
others
posted
in
the
shrouds
and
armed
with
spyglasses
were
attentively
surveying
the
island
certainly
bob
harvey
and
his
crew
would
not
be
able
easily
to
give
an
account
of
what
had
happened
during
the
night
on
board
the
brig
had
this
halfnaked
man
who
had
forced
the
door
of
the
powdermagazine
and
with
whom
they
had
struggled
who
had
six
times
discharged
his
revolver
at
them
who
had
killed
one
and
wounded
two
others
escaped
their
shot
had
he
been
able
to
swim
to
shore
whence
did
he
come
what
had
been
his
object
had
his
design
really
been
to
blow
up
the
brig
as
bob
harvey
had
thought
all
this
must
be
confused
enough
to
the
convicts
minds
but
what
they
could
no
longer
doubt
was
that
the
unknown
island
before
which
the
speedy
had
cast
anchor
was
inhabited
and
that
there
was
perhaps
a
numerous
colony
ready
to
defend
it
and
yet
no
one
was
to
be
seen
neither
on
the
shore
nor
on
the
heights
the
beach
appeared
to
be
absolutely
deserted
at
any
rate
there
was
no
trace
of
dwellings
had
the
inhabitants
fled
into
the
interior
thus
probably
the
pirate
captain
reasoned
and
doubtless
like
a
prudent
man
he
wished
to
reconnoiter
the
locality
before
he
allowed
his
men
to
venture
there
during
an
hour
and
a
half
no
indication
of
attack
or
landing
could
be
observed
on
board
the
brig
evidently
bob
harvey
was
hesitating
even
with
his
strongest
telescopes
he
could
not
have
perceived
one
of
the
settlers
crouched
among
the
rocks
it
was
not
even
probable
that
his
attention
had
been
awakened
by
the
screen
of
green
branches
and
creepers
hiding
the
windows
of
granite
house
and
showing
rather
conspicuously
on
the
bare
rock
indeed
how
could
he
imagine
that
a
dwelling
was
hollowed
out
at
that
height
in
the
solid
granite
from
claw
cape
to
the
mandible
capes
in
all
the
extent
of
union
bay
there
was
nothing
to
lead
him
to
suppose
that
the
island
was
or
could
be
inhabited
at
eight
oclock
however
the
colonists
observed
a
movement
on
board
the
speedy
a
boat
was
lowered
and
seven
men
jumped
into
her
they
were
armed
with
muskets
one
took
the
yokelines
four
others
the
oars
and
the
two
others
kneeling
in
the
bows
ready
to
fire
reconnoitered
the
island
their
object
was
no
doubt
to
make
an
examination
but
not
to
land
for
in
the
latter
case
they
would
have
come
in
larger
numbers
the
pirates
from
their
lookout
could
have
seen
that
the
coast
was
sheltered
by
an
islet
separated
from
it
by
a
channel
half
a
mile
in
width
however
it
was
soon
evident
to
cyrus
harding
on
observing
the
direction
followed
by
the
boat
that
they
would
not
attempt
to
penetrate
into
the
channel
but
would
land
on
the
islet
pencroft
and
ayrton
each
hidden
in
a
narrow
cleft
of
the
rock
saw
them
coming
directly
towards
them
and
waited
till
they
were
within
range
the
boat
advanced
with
extreme
caution
the
oars
only
dipped
into
the
water
at
long
intervals
it
could
now
be
seen
that
one
of
the
convicts
held
a
leadline
in
his
hand
and
that
he
wished
to
fathom
the
depth
of
the
channel
hollowed
out
by
the
current
of
the
mercy
this
showed
that
it
was
bob
harveys
intention
to
bring
his
brig
as
near
as
possible
to
the
coast
about
thirty
pirates
scattered
in
the
rigging
followed
every
movement
of
the
boat
and
took
the
bearings
of
certain
landmarks
which
would
allow
them
to
approach
without
danger
the
boat
was
not
more
than
two
cableslengths
off
the
islet
when
she
stopped
the
man
at
the
tiller
stood
up
and
looked
for
the
best
place
at
which
to
land
at
that
moment
two
shots
were
heard
smoke
curled
up
from
among
the
rocks
of
the
islet
the
man
at
the
helm
and
the
man
with
the
leadline
fell
backwards
into
the
boat
ayrtons
and
pencrofts
balls
had
struck
them
both
at
the
same
moment
almost
immediately
a
louder
report
was
heard
a
cloud
of
smoke
issued
from
the
brigs
side
and
a
ball
striking
the
summit
of
the
rock
which
sheltered
ayrton
and
pencroft
made
it
fly
in
splinters
but
the
two
marksmen
remained
unhurt
horrible
imprecations
burst
from
the
boat
which
immediately
continued
its
way
the
man
who
had
been
at
the
tiller
was
replaced
by
one
of
his
comrades
and
the
oars
were
rapidly
plunged
into
the
water
however
instead
of
returning
on
board
as
might
have
been
expected
the
boat
coasted
along
the
islet
so
as
to
round
its
southern
point
the
pirates
pulled
vigorously
at
their
oars
that
they
might
get
out
of
range
of
the
bullets
they
advanced
to
within
five
cableslengths
of
that
part
of
the
shore
terminated
by
flotsam
point
and
after
having
rounded
it
in
a
semicircular
line
still
protected
by
the
brigs
guns
they
proceeded
towards
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
their
evident
intention
was
to
penetrate
into
the
channel
and
cut
off
the
colonists
posted
on
the
islet
in
such
a
way
that
whatever
their
number
might
be
being
placed
between
the
fire
from
the
boat
and
the
fire
from
the
brig
they
would
find
themselves
in
a
very
disadvantageous
position
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
while
the
boat
advanced
in
this
direction
absolute
silence
perfect
calm
reigned
in
the
air
and
on
the
water
pencroft
and
ayrton
although
they
knew
they
ran
the
risk
of
being
cut
off
had
not
left
their
post
both
that
they
did
not
wish
to
show
themselves
as
yet
to
their
assailants
and
expose
themselves
to
the
speedys
guns
and
that
they
relied
on
neb
and
gideon
spilett
watching
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
on
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
in
ambush
among
the
rocks
at
the
chimneys
twenty
minutes
after
the
first
shots
were
fired
the
boat
was
less
than
two
cableslengths
off
the
mercy
as
the
tide
was
beginning
to
rise
with
its
accustomed
violence
caused
by
the
narrowness
of
the
straits
the
pirates
were
drawn
towards
the
river
and
it
was
only
by
dint
of
hard
rowing
that
they
were
able
to
keep
in
the
middle
of
the
channel
but
as
they
were
passing
within
good
range
of
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
two
balls
saluted
them
and
two
more
of
their
number
were
laid
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
neb
and
spilett
had
not
missed
their
aim
the
brig
immediately
sent
a
second
ball
on
the
post
betrayed
by
the
smoke
but
without
any
other
result
than
that
of
splintering
the
rock
the
boat
now
contained
only
three
able
men
carried
on
by
the
current
it
shot
through
the
channel
with
the
rapidity
of
an
arrow
passed
before
harding
and
herbert
who
not
thinking
it
within
range
withheld
their
fire
then
rounding
the
northern
point
of
the
islet
with
the
two
remaining
oars
they
pulled
towards
the
brig
hitherto
the
settlers
had
nothing
to
complain
of
their
adversaries
had
certainly
had
the
worst
of
it
the
latter
already
counted
four
men
seriously
wounded
if
not
dead
they
on
the
contrary
unwounded
had
not
missed
a
shot
if
the
pirates
continued
to
attack
them
in
this
way
if
they
renewed
their
attempt
to
land
by
means
of
a
boat
they
could
be
destroyed
one
by
one
it
was
now
seen
how
advantageous
the
engineers
arrangements
had
been
the
pirates
would
think
that
they
had
to
deal
with
numerous
and
wellarmed
adversaries
whom
they
could
not
easily
get
the
better
of
half
an
hour
passed
before
the
boat
having
to
pull
against
the
current
could
get
alongside
the
speedy
frightful
cries
were
heard
when
they
returned
on
board
with
the
wounded
and
two
or
three
guns
were
fired
with
no
results
but
now
about
a
dozen
other
convicts
maddened
with
rage
and
possibly
by
the
effect
of
the
evenings
potations
threw
themselves
into
the
boat
a
second
boat
was
also
lowered
in
which
eight
men
took
their
places
and
while
the
first
pulled
straight
for
the
islet
to
dislodge
the
colonists
from
thence
the
second
maneuvered
so
as
to
force
the
entrance
of
the
mercy
the
situation
was
evidently
becoming
very
dangerous
for
pencroft
and
ayrton
and
they
saw
that
they
must
regain
the
mainland
however
they
waited
till
the
first
boat
was
within
range
when
two
welldirected
balls
threw
its
crew
into
disorder
then
pencroft
and
ayrton
abandoning
their
posts
under
fire
from
the
dozen
muskets
ran
across
the
islet
at
full
speed
jumped
into
their
boat
crossed
the
channel
at
the
moment
the
second
boat
reached
the
southern
end
and
ran
to
hide
themselves
in
the
chimneys
they
had
scarcely
rejoined
cyrus
harding
and
herbert
before
the
islet
was
overrun
with
pirates
in
every
direction
almost
at
the
same
moment
fresh
reports
resounded
from
the
mercy
station
to
which
the
second
boat
was
rapidly
approaching
two
out
of
the
eight
men
who
manned
her
were
mortally
wounded
by
gideon
spilett
and
neb
and
the
boat
herself
carried
irresistibly
onto
the
reefs
was
stove
in
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
but
the
six
survivors
holding
their
muskets
above
their
heads
to
preserve
them
from
contact
with
the
water
managed
to
land
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
then
finding
they
were
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
ambush
there
they
fled
in
the
direction
of
flotsam
point
out
of
range
of
the
balls
the
actual
situation
was
this
on
the
islet
were
a
dozen
convicts
of
whom
some
were
no
doubt
wounded
but
who
had
still
a
boat
at
their
disposal
on
the
island
were
six
but
who
could
not
by
any
possibility
reach
granite
house
as
they
could
not
cross
the
river
all
the
bridges
being
raised
hallo
exclaimed
pencroft
as
he
rushed
into
the
chimneys
hallo
captain
what
do
you
think
of
it
now
i
think
answered
the
engineer
that
the
combat
will
now
take
a
new
form
for
it
cannot
be
supposed
that
the
convicts
will
be
so
foolish
as
to
remain
in
a
position
so
unfavorable
for
them
they
wont
cross
the
channel
said
the
sailor
ayrton
and
mr
spiletts
rifles
are
there
to
prevent
them
you
know
that
they
carry
more
than
a
mile
no
doubt
replied
herbert
but
what
can
two
rifles
do
against
the
brigs
guns
well
the
brig
isnt
in
the
channel
yet
i
fancy
said
pencroft
but
suppose
she
does
come
there
said
harding
thats
impossible
for
she
would
risk
running
aground
and
being
lost
it
is
possible
said
ayrton
the
convicts
might
profit
by
the
high
tide
to
enter
the
channel
with
the
risk
of
grounding
at
low
tide
it
is
true
but
then
under
the
fire
from
her
guns
our
posts
would
be
no
longer
tenable
confound
them
exclaimed
pencroft
it
really
seems
as
if
the
blackguards
were
preparing
to
weigh
anchor
perhaps
we
shall
be
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
granite
house
observed
herbert
we
must
wait
answered
cyrus
harding
but
mr
spilett
and
neb
said
pencroft
they
will
know
when
it
is
best
to
rejoin
us
be
ready
ayrton
it
is
yours
and
spiletts
rifles
which
must
speak
now
it
was
only
too
true
the
speedy
was
beginning
to
weigh
her
anchor
and
her
intention
was
evidently
to
approach
the
islet
the
tide
would
be
rising
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
the
ebb
current
being
already
weakened
it
would
be
easy
for
the
brig
to
advance
but
as
to
entering
the
channel
pencroft
contrary
to
ayrtons
opinion
could
not
believe
that
she
would
dare
to
attempt
it
in
the
meanwhile
the
pirates
who
occupied
the
islet
had
gradually
advanced
to
the
opposite
shore
and
were
now
only
separated
from
the
mainland
by
the
channel
being
armed
with
muskets
alone
they
could
do
no
harm
to
the
settlers
in
ambush
at
the
chimneys
and
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
but
not
knowing
the
latter
to
be
supplied
with
longrange
rifles
they
on
their
side
did
not
believe
themselves
to
be
exposed
quite
uncovered
therefore
they
surveyed
the
islet
and
examined
the
shore
their
illusion
was
of
short
duration
ayrtons
and
gideon
spiletts
rifles
then
spoke
and
no
doubt
imparted
some
very
disagreeable
intelligence
to
two
of
the
convicts
for
they
fell
backwards
then
there
was
a
general
helterskelter
the
ten
others
not
even
stopping
to
pick
up
their
dead
or
wounded
companions
fled
to
the
other
side
of
the
islet
tumbled
into
the
boat
which
had
brought
them
and
pulled
away
with
all
their
strength
eight
less
exclaimed
pencroft
really
one
would
have
thought
that
mr
spilett
and
ayrton
had
given
the
word
to
fire
together
gentlemen
said
ayrton
as
he
reloaded
his
gun
this
is
becoming
more
serious
the
brig
is
making
sail
the
anchor
is
weighed
exclaimed
pencroft
yes
and
she
is
already
moving
in
fact
they
could
distinctly
hear
the
creaking
of
the
windlass
the
speedy
was
at
first
held
by
her
anchor
then
when
that
had
been
raised
she
began
to
drift
towards
the
shore
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
sea
the
jib
and
the
foretopsail
were
hoisted
and
the
vessel
gradually
approached
the
island
from
the
two
posts
of
the
mercy
and
the
chimneys
they
watched
her
without
giving
a
sign
of
life
but
not
without
some
emotion
what
could
be
more
terrible
for
the
colonists
than
to
be
exposed
at
a
short
distance
to
the
brigs
guns
without
being
able
to
reply
with
any
effect
how
could
they
then
prevent
the
pirates
from
landing
cyrus
harding
felt
this
strongly
and
he
asked
himself
what
it
would
be
possible
to
do
before
long
he
would
be
called
upon
for
his
determination
but
what
was
it
to
be
to
shut
themselves
up
in
granite
house
to
be
besieged
there
to
remain
there
for
weeks
for
months
even
since
they
had
an
abundance
of
provisions
so
far
good
but
after
that
the
pirates
would
not
the
less
be
masters
of
the
island
which
they
would
ravage
at
their
pleasure
and
in
time
they
would
end
by
having
their
revenge
on
the
prisoners
in
granite
house
however
one
chance
yet
remained
it
was
that
bob
harvey
after
all
would
not
venture
his
ship
into
the
channel
and
that
he
would
keep
outside
the
islet
he
would
be
still
separated
from
the
coast
by
half
a
mile
and
at
that
distance
his
shot
could
not
be
very
destructive
never
repeated
pencroft
bob
harvey
will
never
if
he
is
a
good
seaman
enter
that
channel
he
knows
well
that
it
would
risk
the
brig
if
the
sea
got
up
ever
so
little
and
what
would
become
of
him
without
his
vessel
in
the
meanwhile
the
brig
approached
the
islet
and
it
could
be
seen
that
she
was
endeavoring
to
make
the
lower
end
the
breeze
was
light
and
as
the
current
had
then
lost
much
of
its
force
bob
harvey
had
absolute
command
over
his
vessel
the
route
previously
followed
by
the
boats
had
allowed
her
to
reconnoiter
the
channel
and
she
boldly
entered
it
the
pirates
design
was
now
only
too
evident
he
wished
to
bring
her
broadside
to
bear
on
the
chimneys
and
from
there
to
reply
with
shell
and
ball
to
the
shot
which
had
till
then
decimated
her
crew
soon
the
speedy
reached
the
point
of
the
islet
she
rounded
it
with
ease
the
mainsail
was
braced
up
and
the
brig
hugging
the
wind
stood
across
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
the
scoundrels
they
are
coming
said
pencroft
at
that
moment
cyrus
harding
ayrton
the
sailor
and
herbert
were
rejoined
by
neb
and
gideon
spilett
the
reporter
and
his
companion
had
judged
it
best
to
abandon
the
post
at
the
mercy
from
which
they
could
do
nothing
against
the
ship
and
they
had
acted
wisely
it
was
better
that
the
colonists
should
be
together
at
the
moment
when
they
were
about
to
engage
in
a
decisive
action
gideon
spilett
and
neb
had
arrived
by
dodging
behind
the
rocks
though
not
without
attracting
a
shower
of
bullets
which
had
not
however
reached
them
spilett
neb
cried
the
engineer
you
are
not
wounded
no
answered
the
reporter
a
few
bruises
only
from
the
ricochet
but
that
cursed
brig
has
entered
the
channel
yes
replied
pencroft
and
in
ten
minutes
she
will
have
anchored
before
granite
house
have
you
formed
any
plan
cyrus
asked
the
reporter
we
must
take
refuge
in
granite
house
while
there
is
still
time
and
the
convicts
cannot
see
us
that
is
my
opinion
too
replied
gideon
spilett
but
once
shut
up
we
must
be
guided
by
circumstances
said
the
engineer
let
us
be
off
then
and
make
haste
said
the
reporter
would
you
not
wish
captain
that
ayrton
and
i
should
remain
here
asked
the
sailor
what
would
be
the
use
of
that
pencroft
replied
harding
no
we
will
not
separate
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
the
colonists
left
the
chimneys
a
bend
of
the
cliff
prevented
them
from
being
seen
by
those
in
the
brig
but
two
or
three
reports
and
the
crash
of
bullets
on
the
rock
told
them
that
the
speedy
was
at
no
great
distance
to
spring
into
the
lift
hoist
themselves
up
to
the
door
of
granite
house
where
top
and
jup
had
been
shut
up
since
the
evening
before
to
rush
into
the
large
room
was
the
work
of
a
minute
only
it
was
quite
time
for
the
settlers
through
the
branches
could
see
the
speedy
surrounded
with
smoke
gliding
up
the
channel
the
firing
was
incessant
and
shot
from
the
four
guns
struck
blindly
both
on
the
mercy
post
although
it
was
not
occupied
and
on
the
chimneys
the
rocks
were
splintered
and
cheers
accompanied
each
discharge
however
they
were
hoping
that
granite
house
would
be
spared
thanks
to
hardings
precaution
of
concealing
the
windows
when
a
shot
piercing
the
door
penetrated
into
the
passage
we
are
discovered
exclaimed
pencroft
the
colonists
had
not
perhaps
been
seen
but
it
was
certain
that
bob
harvey
had
thought
proper
to
send
a
ball
through
the
suspected
foliage
which
concealed
that
part
of
the
cliff
soon
he
redoubled
his
attack
when
another
ball
having
torn
away
the
leafy
screen
disclosed
a
gaping
aperture
in
the
granite
the
colonists
situation
was
desperate
their
retreat
was
discovered
they
could
not
oppose
any
obstacle
to
these
missiles
nor
protect
the
stone
which
flew
in
splinters
around
them
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
take
refuge
in
the
upper
passage
of
granite
house
and
leave
their
dwelling
to
be
devastated
when
a
deep
roar
was
heard
followed
by
frightful
cries
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
rushed
to
one
of
the
windows
the
brig
irresistibly
raised
on
a
sort
of
waterspout
had
just
split
in
two
and
in
less
than
ten
seconds
she
was
swallowed
up
with
all
her
criminal
crew
chapter
4
she
has
blown
up
cried
herbert
yes
blown
up
just
as
if
ayrton
had
set
fire
to
the
powder
returned
pencroft
throwing
himself
into
the
lift
together
with
neb
and
the
lad
but
what
has
happened
asked
gideon
spilett
quite
stunned
by
this
unexpected
catastrophe
oh
this
time
we
shall
know
answered
the
engineer
quickly
what
shall
we
know
later
later
come
spilett
the
main
point
is
that
these
pirates
have
been
exterminated
and
cyrus
harding
hurrying
away
the
reporter
and
ayrton
joined
pencroft
neb
and
herbert
on
the
beach
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
brig
not
even
her
masts
after
having
been
raised
by
the
waterspout
she
had
fallen
on
her
side
and
had
sunk
in
that
position
doubtless
in
consequence
of
some
enormous
leak
but
as
in
that
place
the
channel
was
not
more
than
twenty
feet
in
depth
it
was
certain
that
the
sides
of
the
submerged
brig
would
reappear
at
low
water
a
few
things
from
the
wreck
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
water
a
raft
could
be
seen
consisting
of
spare
spars
coops
of
poultry
with
their
occupants
still
living
boxes
and
barrels
which
gradually
came
to
the
surface
after
having
escaped
through
the
hatchways
but
no
pieces
of
the
wreck
appeared
neither
planks
from
the
deck
nor
timber
from
the
hullwhich
rendered
the
sudden
disappearance
of
the
speedy
perfectly
inexplicable
however
the
two
masts
which
had
been
broken
and
escaped
from
the
shrouds
and
stays
came
up
and
with
their
sails
some
furled
and
the
others
spread
but
it
was
not
necessary
to
wait
for
the
tide
to
bring
up
these
riches
and
ayrton
and
pencroft
jumped
into
the
boat
with
the
intention
of
towing
the
pieces
of
wreck
either
to
the
beach
or
to
the
islet
but
just
as
they
were
shoving
off
an
observation
from
gideon
spilett
arrested
them
what
about
those
six
convicts
who
disembarked
on
the
right
bank
of
the
mercy
said
he
in
fact
it
would
not
do
to
forget
that
the
six
men
whose
boat
had
gone
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
had
landed
at
flotsam
point
they
looked
in
that
direction
none
of
the
fugitives
were
visible
it
was
probable
that
having
seen
their
vessel
engulfed
in
the
channel
they
had
fled
into
the
interior
of
the
island
we
will
deal
with
them
later
said
harding
as
they
are
armed
they
will
still
be
dangerous
but
as
it
is
six
against
six
the
chances
are
equal
to
the
most
pressing
business
first
ayrton
and
pencroft
pulled
vigorously
towards
the
wreck
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
tide
very
high
as
there
had
been
a
new
moon
but
two
days
before
a
whole
hour
at
least
would
elapse
before
the
hull
of
the
brig
could
emerge
from
the
water
of
the
channel
ayrton
and
pencroft
were
able
to
fasten
the
masts
and
spars
by
means
of
ropes
the
ends
of
which
were
carried
to
the
beach
there
by
the
united
efforts
of
the
settlers
the
pieces
of
wreck
were
hauled
up
then
the
boat
picked
up
all
that
was
floating
coops
barrels
and
boxes
which
were
immediately
carried
to
the
chimneys
several
bodies
floated
also
among
them
ayrton
recognized
that
of
bob
harvey
which
he
pointed
out
to
his
companion
saying
with
some
emotion
that
is
what
i
have
been
pencroft
but
what
you
are
no
longer
brave
ayrton
returned
the
sailor
warmly
it
was
singular
enough
that
so
few
bodies
floated
only
five
or
six
were
counted
which
were
already
being
carried
by
the
current
towards
the
open
sea
very
probably
the
convicts
had
not
had
time
to
escape
and
the
ship
lying
over
on
her
side
the
greater
number
of
them
had
remained
below
now
the
current
by
carrying
the
bodies
of
these
miserable
men
out
to
sea
would
spare
the
colonists
the
sad
task
of
burying
them
in
some
corner
of
their
island
for
two
hours
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
were
solely
occupied
in
hauling
up
the
spars
on
to
the
sand
and
then
in
spreading
the
sails
which
were
perfectly
uninjured
to
dry
they
spoke
little
for
they
were
absorbed
in
their
work
but
what
thoughts
occupied
their
minds
the
possession
of
this
brig
or
rather
all
that
she
contained
was
a
perfect
mine
of
wealth
in
fact
a
ship
is
like
a
little
world
in
miniature
and
the
stores
of
the
colony
would
be
increased
by
a
large
number
of
useful
articles
it
would
be
on
a
large
scale
equivalent
to
the
chest
found
at
flotsam
point
and
besides
thought
pencroft
why
should
it
be
impossible
to
refloat
the
brig
if
she
has
only
a
leak
that
may
be
stopped
up
a
vessel
from
three
to
four
hundred
tons
why
she
is
a
regular
ship
compared
to
our
bonadventure
and
we
could
go
a
long
distance
in
her
we
could
go
anywhere
we
liked
captain
harding
ayrton
and
i
must
examine
her
she
would
be
well
worth
the
trouble
in
fact
if
the
brig
was
still
fit
to
navigate
the
colonists
chances
of
returning
to
their
native
land
were
singularly
increased
but
to
decide
this
important
question
it
was
necessary
to
wait
until
the
tide
was
quite
low
so
that
every
part
of
the
brigs
hull
might
be
examined
when
their
treasures
had
been
safely
conveyed
on
shore
harding
and
his
companions
agreed
to
devote
some
minutes
to
breakfast
they
were
almost
famished
fortunately
the
larder
was
not
far
off
and
neb
was
noted
for
being
an
expeditious
cook
they
breakfasted
therefore
near
the
chimneys
and
during
their
repast
as
may
be
supposed
nothing
was
talked
of
but
the
event
which
had
so
miraculously
saved
the
colony
miraculous
is
the
word
repeated
pencroft
for
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
those
rascals
blew
up
just
at
the
right
moment
granite
house
was
beginning
to
be
uncomfortable
as
a
habitation
and
can
you
guess
pencroft
asked
the
reporter
how
it
happened
or
what
can
have
occasioned
the
explosion
oh
mr
spilett
nothing
is
more
simple
answered
pencroft
a
convict
vessel
is
not
disciplined
like
a
manofwar
convicts
are
not
sailors
of
course
the
powdermagazine
was
open
and
as
they
were
firing
incessantly
some
careless
or
clumsy
fellow
just
blew
up
the
vessel
captain
harding
said
herbert
what
astonishes
me
is
that
the
explosion
has
not
produced
more
effect
the
report
was
not
loud
and
besides
there
are
so
few
planks
and
timbers
torn
out
it
seems
as
if
the
ship
had
rather
foundered
than
blown
up
does
that
astonish
you
my
boy
asked
the
engineer
yes
captain
and
it
astonishes
me
also
herbert
replied
he
but
when
we
visit
the
hull
of
the
brig
we
shall
no
doubt
find
the
explanation
of
the
matter
why
captain
said
pencroft
you
dont
suppose
that
the
speedy
simply
foundered
like
a
ship
which
has
struck
on
a
rock
why
not
observed
neb
if
there
are
rocks
in
the
channel
nonsense
neb
answered
pencroft
you
did
not
look
at
the
right
moment
an
instant
before
she
sank
the
brig
as
i
saw
perfectly
well
rose
on
an
enormous
wave
and
fell
back
on
her
larboard
side
now
if
she
had
only
struck
she
would
have
sunk
quietly
and
gone
to
the
bottom
like
an
honest
vessel
it
was
just
because
she
was
not
an
honest
vessel
returned
neb
well
we
shall
soon
see
pencroft
said
the
engineer
we
shall
soon
see
rejoined
the
sailor
but
i
would
wager
my
head
there
are
no
rocks
in
the
channel
look
here
captain
to
speak
candidly
do
you
mean
to
say
that
there
is
anything
marvelous
in
the
occurrence
cyrus
harding
did
not
answer
at
any
rate
said
gideon
spilett
whether
rock
or
explosion
you
will
agree
pencroft
that
it
occurred
just
in
the
nick
of
time
yes
yes
replied
the
sailor
but
that
is
not
the
question
i
ask
captain
harding
if
he
sees
anything
supernatural
in
all
this
i
cannot
say
pencroft
said
the
engineer
that
is
all
the
answer
i
can
make
a
reply
which
did
not
satisfy
pencroft
at
all
he
stuck
to
an
explosion
and
did
not
wish
to
give
it
up
he
would
never
consent
to
admit
that
in
that
channel
with
its
fine
sandy
bed
just
like
the
beach
which
he
had
often
crossed
at
low
water
there
could
be
an
unknown
rock
and
besides
at
the
time
the
brig
foundered
it
was
high
water
that
is
to
say
there
was
enough
water
to
carry
the
vessel
clear
over
any
rocks
which
would
not
be
uncovered
at
low
tide
therefore
there
could
not
have
been
a
collision
therefore
the
vessel
had
not
struck
so
she
had
blown
up
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
sailors
arguments
were
reasonable
towards
halfpast
one
the
colonists
embarked
in
the
boat
to
visit
the
wreck
it
was
to
be
regretted
that
the
brigs
two
boats
had
not
been
saved
but
one
as
has
been
said
had
gone
to
pieces
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
and
was
absolutely
useless
the
other
had
disappeared
when
the
brig
went
down
and
had
not
again
been
seen
having
doubtless
been
crushed
the
hull
of
the
speedy
was
just
beginning
to
issue
from
the
water
the
brig
was
lying
right
over
on
her
side
for
her
masts
being
broken
pressed
down
by
the
weight
of
the
ballast
displaced
by
the
shock
the
keel
was
visible
along
her
whole
length
she
had
been
regularly
turned
over
by
the
inexplicable
but
frightful
submarine
action
which
had
been
at
the
same
time
manifested
by
an
enormous
waterspout
the
settlers
rowed
round
the
hull
and
in
proportion
as
the
tide
went
down
they
could
ascertain
if
not
the
cause
which
had
occasioned
the
catastrophe
at
least
the
effect
produced
towards
the
bows
on
both
sides
of
the
keel
seven
or
eight
feet
from
the
beginning
of
the
stem
the
sides
of
the
brig
were
frightfully
torn
over
a
length
of
at
least
twenty
feet
there
opened
two
large
leaks
which
would
be
impossible
to
stop
up
not
only
had
the
copper
sheathing
and
the
planks
disappeared
reduced
no
doubt
to
powder
but
also
the
ribs
the
iron
bolts
and
treenails
which
united
them
from
the
entire
length
of
the
hull
to
the
stern
the
false
keel
had
been
separated
with
an
unaccountable
violence
and
the
keel
itself
torn
from
the
carline
in
several
places
was
split
in
all
its
length
ive
a
notion
exclaimed
pencroft
that
this
vessel
will
be
difficult
to
get
afloat
again
it
will
be
impossible
said
ayrton
at
any
rate
observed
gideon
spilett
to
the
sailor
the
explosion
if
there
has
been
one
has
produced
singular
effects
it
has
split
the
lower
part
of
the
hull
instead
of
blowing
up
the
deck
and
topsides
these
great
rents
appear
rather
to
have
been
made
by
a
rock
than
by
the
explosion
of
a
powdermagazine
there
is
not
a
rock
in
the
channel
answered
the
sailor
i
will
admit
anything
you
like
except
the
rock
let
us
try
to
penetrate
into
the
interior
of
the
brig
said
the
engineer
perhaps
we
shall
then
know
what
to
think
of
the
cause
of
her
destruction
this
was
the
best
thing
to
be
done
and
it
was
agreed
besides
to
take
an
inventory
of
all
the
treasures
on
board
and
to
arrange
their
preservation
access
to
the
interior
of
the
brig
was
now
easy
the
tide
was
still
going
down
and
the
deck
was
practicable
the
ballast
composed
of
heavy
masses
of
iron
had
broken
through
in
several
places
the
noise
of
the
sea
could
be
heard
as
it
rushed
out
at
the
holes
in
the
hull
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
hatchets
in
hand
advanced
along
the
shattered
deck
cases
of
all
sorts
encumbered
it
and
as
they
had
been
but
a
very
short
time
in
the
water
their
contents
were
perhaps
uninjured
they
then
busied
themselves
in
placing
all
this
cargo
in
safety
the
water
would
not
return
for
several
hours
and
these
hours
must
be
employed
in
the
most
profitable
way
ayrton
and
pencroft
had
at
the
entrance
made
in
the
hull
discovered
tackle
which
would
serve
to
hoist
up
the
barrels
and
chests
the
boat
received
them
and
transported
them
to
the
shore
they
took
the
articles
as
they
came
intending
to
sort
them
afterwards
at
any
rate
the
settlers
saw
at
once
with
extreme
satisfaction
that
the
brig
possessed
a
very
varied
cargoan
assortment
of
all
sorts
of
articles
utensils
manufactured
goods
and
toolssuch
as
the
ships
which
make
the
great
coastingtrade
of
polynesia
are
usually
laden
with
it
was
probable
that
they
would
find
a
little
of
everything
and
they
agreed
that
it
was
exactly
what
was
necessary
for
the
colony
of
lincoln
island
howeverand
cyrus
harding
observed
it
in
silent
astonishmentnot
only
as
has
been
said
had
the
hull
of
the
brig
enormously
suffered
from
the
shock
whatever
it
was
that
had
occasioned
the
catastrophe
but
the
interior
arrangements
had
been
destroyed
especially
towards
the
bows
partitions
and
stanchions
were
smashed
as
if
some
tremendous
shell
had
burst
in
the
interior
of
the
brig
the
colonists
could
easily
go
fore
and
aft
after
having
removed
the
cases
as
they
were
extricated
they
were
not
heavy
bales
which
would
have
been
difficult
to
remove
but
simple
packages
of
which
the
stowage
besides
was
no
longer
recognizable
the
colonists
then
reached
the
stern
of
the
brigthe
part
formerly
surmounted
by
the
poop
it
was
there
that
following
ayrtons
directions
they
must
look
for
the
powdermagazine
cyrus
harding
thought
that
it
had
not
exploded
that
it
was
possible
some
barrels
might
be
saved
and
that
the
powder
which
is
usually
enclosed
in
metal
coverings
might
not
have
suffered
from
contact
with
the
water
this
in
fact
was
just
what
had
happened
they
extricated
from
among
a
large
number
of
shot
twenty
barrels
the
insides
of
which
were
lined
with
copper
pencroft
was
convinced
by
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
that
the
destruction
of
the
speedy
could
not
be
attributed
to
an
explosion
that
part
of
the
hull
in
which
the
magazine
was
situated
was
moreover
that
which
had
suffered
least
it
may
be
so
said
the
obstinate
sailor
but
as
to
a
rock
there
is
not
one
in
the
channel
then
how
did
it
happen
asked
herbert
i
dont
know
answered
pencroft
captain
harding
doesnt
know
and
nobody
knows
or
ever
will
know
several
hours
had
passed
during
these
researches
and
the
tide
began
to
flow
work
must
be
suspended
for
the
present
there
was
no
fear
of
the
brig
being
carried
away
by
the
sea
for
she
was
already
fixed
as
firmly
as
if
moored
by
her
anchors
they
could
therefore
without
inconvenience
wait
until
the
next
day
to
resume
operations
but
as
to
the
vessel
itself
she
was
doomed
and
it
would
be
best
to
hasten
to
save
the
remains
of
her
hull
as
she
would
not
be
long
in
disappearing
in
the
quicksands
of
the
channel
it
was
now
five
oclock
in
the
evening
it
had
been
a
hard
days
work
for
the
men
they
ate
with
good
appetite
and
notwithstanding
their
fatigue
they
could
not
resist
after
dinner
their
desire
of
inspecting
the
cases
which
composed
the
cargo
of
the
speedy
most
of
them
contained
clothes
which
as
may
be
believed
was
well
received
there
were
enough
to
clothe
a
whole
colonylinen
for
every
ones
use
shoes
for
every
ones
feet
we
are
too
rich
exclaimed
pencroft
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
all
this
and
every
moment
burst
forth
the
hurrahs
of
the
delighted
sailor
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
barrels
of
gunpowder
firearms
and
sidearms
balls
of
cotton
implements
of
husbandry
carpenters
joiners
and
blacksmiths
tools
and
boxes
of
all
kinds
of
seeds
not
in
the
least
injured
by
their
short
sojourn
in
the
water
ah
two
years
before
how
these
things
would
have
been
prized
and
now
even
though
the
industrious
colonists
had
provided
themselves
with
tools
these
treasures
would
find
their
use
there
was
no
want
of
space
in
the
storerooms
of
granite
house
but
that
daytime
would
not
allow
them
to
stow
away
the
whole
it
would
not
do
also
to
forget
that
the
six
survivors
of
the
speedys
crew
had
landed
on
the
island
for
they
were
in
all
probability
scoundrels
of
the
deepest
dye
and
it
was
necessary
that
the
colonists
should
be
on
their
guard
against
them
although
the
bridges
over
the
mercy
were
raised
the
convicts
would
not
be
stopped
by
a
river
or
a
stream
and
rendered
desperate
these
wretches
would
be
capable
of
anything
they
would
see
later
what
plan
it
would
be
best
to
follow
but
in
the
meantime
it
was
necessary
to
mount
guard
over
cases
and
packages
heaped
up
near
the
chimneys
and
thus
the
settlers
employed
themselves
in
turn
during
the
night
the
morning
came
however
without
the
convicts
having
attempted
any
attack
master
jup
and
top
on
guard
at
the
foot
of
granite
house
would
have
quickly
given
the
alarm
the
three
following
daysthe
19th
20th
and
21st
of
octoberwere
employed
in
saving
everything
of
value
or
of
any
use
whatever
either
from
the
cargo
or
rigging
of
the
brig
at
low
tide
they
overhauled
the
holdat
high
tide
they
stowed
away
the
rescued
articles
a
great
part
of
the
copper
sheathing
had
been
torn
from
the
hull
which
every
day
sank
lower
but
before
the
sand
had
swallowed
the
heavy
things
which
had
fallen
through
the
bottom
ayrton
and
pencroft
diving
to
the
bed
of
the
channel
recovered
the
chains
and
anchors
of
the
brig
the
iron
of
her
ballast
and
even
four
guns
which
floated
by
means
of
empty
casks
were
brought
to
shore
it
may
be
seen
that
the
arsenal
of
the
colony
had
gained
by
the
wreck
as
well
as
the
storerooms
of
granite
house
pencroft
always
enthusiastic
in
his
projects
already
spoke
of
constructing
a
battery
to
command
the
channel
and
the
mouth
of
the
river
with
four
guns
he
engaged
to
prevent
any
fleet
however
powerful
it
might
be
from
venturing
into
the
waters
of
lincoln
island
in
the
meantime
when
nothing
remained
of
the
brig
but
a
useless
hulk
bad
weather
came
on
which
soon
finished
her
cyrus
harding
had
intended
to
blow
her
up
so
as
to
collect
the
remains
on
the
shore
but
a
strong
gale
from
the
northeast
and
a
heavy
sea
compelled
him
to
economize
his
powder
in
fact
on
the
night
of
the
23rd
the
hull
entirely
broke
up
and
some
of
the
wreck
was
cast
up
on
the
beach
as
to
the
papers
on
board
it
is
useless
to
say
that
although
he
carefully
searched
the
lockers
of
the
poop
harding
did
not
discover
any
trace
of
them
the
pirates
had
evidently
destroyed
everything
that
concerned
either
the
captain
or
the
owners
of
the
speedy
and
as
the
name
of
her
port
was
not
painted
on
her
counter
there
was
nothing
which
would
tell
them
her
nationality
however
by
the
shape
of
her
boats
ayrton
and
pencroft
believed
that
the
brig
was
of
english
build
a
week
after
the
castropheor
rather
after
the
fortunate
though
inexplicable
event
to
which
the
colony
owed
its
preservationnothing
more
could
be
seen
of
the
vessel
even
at
low
tide
the
wreck
had
disappeared
and
granite
house
was
enriched
by
nearly
all
it
had
contained
however
the
mystery
which
enveloped
its
strange
destruction
would
doubtless
never
have
been
cleared
away
if
on
the
30th
of
november
neb
strolling
on
the
beach
had
not
found
a
piece
of
a
thick
iron
cylinder
bearing
traces
of
explosion
the
edges
of
this
cylinder
were
twisted
and
broken
as
if
they
had
been
subjected
to
the
action
of
some
explosive
substance
neb
brought
this
piece
of
metal
to
his
master
who
was
then
occupied
with
his
companions
in
the
workshop
of
the
chimneys
cyrus
harding
examined
the
cylinder
attentively
then
turning
to
pencroft
you
persist
my
friend
said
he
in
maintaining
that
the
speedy
was
not
lost
in
consequence
of
a
collision
yes
captain
answered
the
sailor
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
there
are
no
rocks
in
the
channel
but
suppose
she
had
run
against
this
piece
of
iron
said
the
engineer
showing
the
broken
cylinder
what
that
bit
of
pipe
exclaimed
pencroft
in
a
tone
of
perfect
incredulity
my
friends
resumed
harding
you
remember
that
before
she
foundered
the
brig
rose
on
the
summit
of
a
regular
waterspout
yes
captain
replied
herbert
well
would
you
like
to
know
what
occasioned
that
waterspout
it
was
this
said
the
engineer
holding
up
the
broken
tube
that
returned
pencroft
yes
this
cylinder
is
all
that
remains
of
a
torpedo
a

exclaimed
the
engineers
companions
and
who
put
the
torpedo
there
demanded
pencroft
who
did
not
like
to
yield
all
that
i
can
tell
you
is
that
it
was
not
i
answered
cyrus
harding
but
it
was
there
and
you
have
been
able
to
judge
of
its
incomparable
power
chapter
5
so
then
all
was
explained
by
the
submarine
explosion
of
this
torpedo
cyrus
harding
could
not
be
mistaken
as
during
the
war
of
the
union
he
had
had
occasion
to
try
these
terrible
engines
of
destruction
it
was
under
the
action
of
this
cylinder
charged
with
some
explosive
substance
nitroglycerine
picrate
or
some
other
material
of
the
same
nature
that
the
water
of
the
channel
had
been
raised
like
a
dome
the
bottom
of
the
brig
crushed
in
and
she
had
sunk
instantly
the
damage
done
to
her
hull
being
so
considerable
that
it
was
impossible
to
refloat
her
the
speedy
had
not
been
able
to
withstand
a
torpedo
that
would
have
destroyed
an
ironclad
as
easily
as
a
fishingboat
yes
all
was
explained
everythingexcept
the
presence
of
the
torpedo
in
the
waters
of
the
channel
my
friends
then
said
cyrus
harding
we
can
no
longer
be
in
doubt
as
to
the
presence
of
a
mysterious
being
a
castaway
like
us
perhaps
abandoned
on
our
island
and
i
say
this
in
order
that
ayrton
may
be
acquainted
with
all
the
strange
events
which
have
occurred
during
these
two
years
who
this
beneficent
stranger
is
whose
intervention
has
so
fortunately
for
us
been
manifested
on
many
occasions
i
cannot
imagine
what
his
object
can
be
in
acting
thus
in
concealing
himself
after
rendering
us
so
many
services
i
cannot
understand
but
his
services
are
not
the
less
real
and
are
of
such
a
nature
that
only
a
man
possessed
of
prodigious
power
could
render
them
ayrton
is
indebted
to
him
as
much
as
we
are
for
if
it
was
the
stranger
who
saved
me
from
the
waves
after
the
fall
from
the
balloon
evidently
it
was
he
who
wrote
the
document
who
placed
the
bottle
in
the
channel
and
who
has
made
known
to
us
the
situation
of
our
companion
i
will
add
that
it
was
he
who
guided
that
chest
provided
with
everything
we
wanted
and
stranded
it
on
flotsam
point
that
it
was
he
who
lighted
that
fire
on
the
heights
of
the
island
which
permitted
you
to
land
that
it
was
he
who
fired
that
bullet
found
in
the
body
of
the
peccary
that
it
was
he
who
plunged
that
torpedo
into
the
channel
which
destroyed
the
brig
in
a
word
that
all
those
inexplicable
events
for
which
we
could
not
assign
a
reason
are
due
to
this
mysterious
being
therefore
whoever
he
may
be
whether
shipwrecked
or
exiled
on
our
island
we
shall
be
ungrateful
if
we
think
ourselves
freed
from
gratitude
towards
him
we
have
contracted
a
debt
and
i
hope
that
we
shall
one
day
pay
it
you
are
right
in
speaking
thus
my
dear
cyrus
replied
gideon
spilett
yes
there
is
an
almost
allpowerful
being
hidden
in
some
part
of
the
island
and
whose
influence
has
been
singularly
useful
to
our
colony
i
will
add
that
the
unknown
appears
to
possess
means
of
action
which
border
on
the
supernatural
if
in
the
events
of
practical
life
the
supernatural
were
recognizable
is
it
he
who
is
in
secret
communication
with
us
by
the
well
in
granite
house
and
has
he
thus
a
knowledge
of
all
our
plans
was
it
he
who
threw
us
that
bottle
when
the
vessel
made
her
first
cruise
was
it
he
who
threw
top
out
of
the
lake
and
killed
the
dugong
was
it
he
who
as
everything
leads
us
to
believe
saved
you
from
the
waves
and
that
under
circumstances
in
which
any
one
else
would
not
have
been
able
to
act
if
it
was
he
he
possesses
a
power
which
renders
him
master
of
the
elements
the
reporters
reasoning
was
just
and
every
one
felt
it
to
be
so
yes
rejoined
cyrus
harding
if
the
intervention
of
a
human
being
is
not
more
questionable
for
us
i
agree
that
he
has
at
his
disposal
means
of
action
beyond
those
possessed
by
humanity
there
is
a
mystery
still
but
if
we
discover
the
man
the
mystery
will
be
discovered
also
the
question
then
is
ought
we
to
respect
the
incognito
of
this
generous
being
or
ought
we
to
do
everything
to
find
him
out
what
is
your
opinion
on
the
matter
my
opinion
said
pencroft
is
that
whoever
he
may
be
he
is
a
brave
man
and
he
has
my
esteem
be
it
so
answered
harding
but
that
is
not
an
answer
pencroft
master
then
said
neb
my
idea
is
that
we
may
search
as
long
as
we
like
for
this
gentleman
whom
you
are
talking
about
but
that
we
shall
not
discover
him
till
he
pleases
thats
not
bad
what
you
say
neb
observed
pencroft
i
am
of
nebs
opinion
said
gideon
spilett
but
that
is
no
reason
for
not
attempting
the
adventure
whether
we
find
this
mysterious
being
or
not
we
shall
at
least
have
fulfilled
our
duty
towards
him
and
you
my
boy
give
us
your
opinion
said
the
engineer
turning
to
herbert
oh
cried
herbert
his
countenance
full
of
animation
how
i
should
like
to
thank
him
he
who
saved
you
first
and
who
has
now
saved
us
of
course
my
boy
replied
pencroft
so
would
i
and
all
of
us
i
am
not
inquisitive
but
i
would
give
one
of
my
eyes
to
see
this
individual
face
to
face
it
seems
to
me
that
he
must
be
handsome
tall
strong
with
a
splendid
beard
radiant
hair
and
that
he
must
be
seated
on
clouds
a
great
ball
in
his
hands
but
pencroft
answered
spilett
you
are
describing
a
picture
of
the
creator
possibly
mr
spilett
replied
the
sailor
but
that
is
how
i
imagine
him
and
you
ayrton
asked
the
engineer
captain
harding
replied
ayrton
i
can
give
you
no
better
advice
in
this
matter
whatever
you
do
will
be
best
when
you
wish
me
to
join
you
in
your
researches
i
am
ready
to
follow
you
i
thank
you
ayrton
answered
cyrus
harding
but
i
should
like
a
more
direct
answer
to
the
question
i
put
to
you
you
are
our
companion
you
have
already
endangered
your
life
several
times
for
us
and
you
as
well
as
the
rest
ought
to
be
consulted
in
the
matter
of
any
important
decision
speak
therefore
captain
harding
replied
ayrton
i
think
that
we
ought
to
do
everything
to
discover
this
unknown
benefactor
perhaps
he
is
alone
perhaps
he
is
suffering
perhaps
he
has
a
life
to
be
renewed
i
too
as
you
said
have
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
pay
him
it
was
he
it
could
be
only
he
who
must
have
come
to
tabor
island
who
found
there
the
wretch
you
knew
and
who
made
known
to
you
that
there
was
an
unfortunate
man
there
to
be
saved
therefore
it
is
thanks
to
him
that
i
have
become
a
man
again
no
i
will
never
forget
him
that
is
settled
then
said
cyrus
harding
we
will
begin
our
researches
as
soon
as
possible
we
will
not
leave
a
corner
of
the
island
unexplored
we
will
search
into
its
most
secret
recesses
and
will
hope
that
our
unknown
friend
will
pardon
us
in
consideration
of
our
intentions
for
several
days
the
colonists
were
actively
employed
in
haymaking
and
the
harvest
before
putting
their
project
of
exploring
the
yet
unknown
parts
of
the
island
into
execution
they
wished
to
get
all
possible
work
finished
it
was
also
the
time
for
collecting
the
various
vegetables
from
the
tabor
island
plants
all
was
stowed
away
and
happily
there
was
no
want
of
room
in
granite
house
in
which
they
might
have
housed
all
the
treasures
of
the
island
the
products
of
the
colony
were
there
methodically
arranged
and
in
a
safe
place
as
may
be
believed
sheltered
as
much
from
animals
as
from
man
there
was
no
fear
of
damp
in
the
middle
of
that
thick
mass
of
granite
many
natural
excavations
situated
in
the
upper
passage
were
enlarged
either
by
pickaxe
or
mine
and
granite
house
thus
became
a
general
warehouse
containing
all
the
provisions
arms
tools
and
spare
utensilsin
a
word
all
the
stores
of
the
colony
as
to
the
guns
obtained
from
the
brig
they
were
pretty
pieces
of
ordnance
which
at
pencrofts
entreaty
were
hoisted
by
means
of
tackle
and
pulleys
right
up
into
granite
house
embrasures
were
made
between
the
windows
and
the
shining
muzzles
of
the
guns
could
soon
be
seen
through
the
granite
cliff
from
this
height
they
commanded
all
union
bay
it
was
like
a
little
gibraltar
and
any
vessel
anchored
off
the
islet
would
inevitably
be
exposed
to
the
fire
of
this
aerial
battery
captain
said
pencroft
one
day
it
was
the
8th
of
november
now
that
our
fortifications
are
finished
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
we
tried
the
range
of
our
guns
do
you
think
that
is
useful
asked
the
engineer
it
is
more
than
useful
it
is
necessary
without
that
how
are
we
to
know
to
what
distance
we
can
send
one
of
those
pretty
shot
with
which
we
are
provided
try
them
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
however
i
think
that
in
making
the
experiment
we
ought
to
employ
not
the
ordinary
powder
the
supply
of
which
i
think
should
remain
untouched
but
the
pyroxyle
which
will
never
fail
us
can
the
cannon
support
the
shock
of
the
pyroxyle
asked
the
reporter
who
was
not
less
anxious
than
pencroft
to
try
the
artillery
of
granite
house
i
believe
so
however
added
the
engineer
we
will
be
prudent
the
engineer
was
right
in
thinking
that
the
guns
were
of
excellent
make
made
of
forged
steel
and
breechloaders
they
ought
consequently
to
be
able
to
bear
a
considerable
charge
and
also
have
an
enormous
range
in
fact
as
regards
practical
effect
the
transit
described
by
the
ball
ought
to
be
as
extended
as
possible
and
this
tension
could
only
be
obtained
under
the
condition
that
the
projectile
should
be
impelled
with
a
very
great
initial
velocity
now
said
harding
to
his
companions
the
initial
velocity
is
in
proportion
to
the
quantity
of
powder
used
in
the
fabrication
of
these
pieces
everything
depends
on
employing
a
metal
with
the
highest
possible
power
of
resistance
and
steel
is
incontestably
that
metal
of
all
others
which
resists
the
best
i
have
therefore
reason
to
believe
that
our
guns
will
bear
without
risk
the
expansion
of
the
pyroxyle
gas
and
will
give
excellent
results
we
shall
be
a
great
deal
more
certain
of
that
when
we
have
tried
them
answered
pencroft
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
the
four
cannons
were
in
perfect
order
since
they
had
been
taken
from
the
water
the
sailor
had
bestowed
great
care
upon
them
how
many
hours
he
had
spent
in
rubbing
greasing
and
polishing
them
and
in
cleaning
the
mechanism
and
now
the
pieces
were
as
brilliant
as
if
they
had
been
on
board
a
frigate
of
the
united
states
navy
on
this
day
therefore
in
presence
of
all
the
members
of
the
colony
including
master
jup
and
top
the
four
cannon
were
successively
tried
they
were
charged
with
pyroxyle
taking
into
consideration
its
explosive
power
which
as
has
been
said
is
four
times
that
of
ordinary
powder
the
projectile
to
be
fired
was
cylindroconic
pencroft
holding
the
end
of
the
quickmatch
stood
ready
to
fire
at
hardings
signal
he
fired
the
shot
passing
over
the
islet
fell
into
the
sea
at
a
distance
which
could
not
be
calculated
with
exactitude
the
second
gun
was
pointed
at
the
rocks
at
the
end
of
flotsam
point
and
the
shot
striking
a
sharp
rock
nearly
three
miles
from
granite
house
made
it
fly
into
splinters
it
was
herbert
who
had
pointed
this
gun
and
fired
it
and
very
proud
he
was
of
his
first
shot
pencroft
only
was
prouder
than
he
such
a
shot
the
honor
of
which
belonged
to
his
dear
boy
the
third
shot
aimed
this
time
at
the
downs
forming
the
upper
side
of
union
bay
struck
the
sand
at
a
distance
of
four
miles
then
having
ricocheted
was
lost
in
the
sea
in
a
cloud
of
spray
for
the
fourth
piece
cyrus
harding
slightly
increased
the
charge
so
as
to
try
its
extreme
range
then
all
standing
aside
for
fear
of
its
bursting
the
match
was
lighted
by
means
of
a
long
cord
a
tremendous
report
was
heard
but
the
piece
had
held
good
and
the
colonists
rushing
to
the
windows
saw
the
shot
graze
the
rocks
of
mandible
cape
nearly
five
miles
from
granite
house
and
disappear
in
shark
gulf
well
captain
exclaimed
pencroft
whose
cheers
might
have
rivaled
the
reports
themselves
what
do
you
say
of
our
battery
all
the
pirates
in
the
pacific
have
only
to
present
themselves
before
granite
house
not
one
can
land
there
now
without
our
permission
believe
me
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
it
would
be
better
not
to
have
to
make
the
experiment
well
said
the
sailor
what
ought
to
be
done
with
regard
to
those
six
villains
who
are
roaming
about
the
island
are
we
to
leave
them
to
overrun
our
forests
our
fields
our
plantations
these
pirates
are
regular
jaguars
and
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
not
to
hesitate
to
treat
them
as
such
what
do
you
think
ayrton
added
pencroft
turning
to
his
companion
ayrton
hesitated
at
first
to
reply
and
cyrus
harding
regretted
that
pencroft
had
so
thoughtlessly
put
this
question
and
he
was
much
moved
when
ayrton
replied
in
a
humble
tone
i
have
been
one
of
those
jaguars
mr
pencroft
i
have
no
right
to
speak
and
with
a
slow
step
he
walked
away
pencroft
understood
what
a
brute
i
am
he
exclaimed
poor
ayrton
he
has
as
much
right
to
speak
here
as
any
one
yes
said
gideon
spilett
but
his
reserve
does
him
honor
and
it
is
right
to
respect
the
feeling
which
he
has
about
his
sad
past
certainly
mr
spilett
answered
the
sailor
and
there
is
no
fear
of
my
doing
so
again
i
would
rather
bite
my
tongue
off
than
cause
ayrton
any
pain
but
to
return
to
the
question
it
seems
to
me
that
these
ruffians
have
no
right
to
any
pity
and
that
we
ought
to
rid
the
island
of
them
as
soon
as
possible
is
that
your
opinion
pencroft
asked
the
engineer
quite
my
opinion
and
before
hunting
them
mercilessly
you
would
not
wait
until
they
had
committed
some
fresh
act
of
hostility
against
us
isnt
what
they
have
done
already
enough
asked
pencroft
who
did
not
understand
these
scruples
they
may
adopt
other
sentiments
said
harding
and
perhaps
repent
they
repent
exclaimed
the
sailor
shrugging
his
shoulders
pencroft
think
of
ayrton
said
herbert
taking
the
sailors
hand
he
became
an
honest
man
again
pencroft
looked
at
his
companions
one
after
the
other
he
had
never
thought
of
his
proposal
being
met
with
any
objection
his
rough
nature
could
not
allow
that
they
ought
to
come
to
terms
with
the
rascals
who
had
landed
on
the
island
with
bob
harveys
accomplices
the
murderers
of
the
crew
of
the
speedy
and
he
looked
upon
them
as
wild
beasts
which
ought
to
be
destroyed
without
delay
and
without
remorse
come
said
be
everybody
is
against
me
you
wish
to
be
generous
to
those
villains
very
well
i
hope
we
maynt
repent
it
what
danger
shall
we
run
said
herbert
if
we
take
care
to
be
always
on
our
guard
hum
observed
the
reporter
who
had
not
given
any
decided
opinion
they
are
six
and
well
armed
if
they
each
lay
hid
in
a
corner
and
each
fired
at
one
of
us
they
would
soon
be
masters
of
the
colony
why
have
they
not
done
so
said
herbert
no
doubt
because
it
was
not
their
interest
to
do
it
besides
we
are
six
also
well
well
replied
pencroft
whom
no
reasoning
could
have
convinced
let
us
leave
these
good
people
to
do
what
they
like
and
dont
think
anything
more
about
them
come
pencroft
said
neb
dont
make
yourself
out
so
bad
as
all
that
suppose
one
of
these
unfortunate
men
were
here
before
you
within
good
range
of
your
guns
you
would
not
fire
i
would
fire
on
him
as
i
would
on
a
mad
dog
neb
replied
pencroft
coldly
pencroft
said
the
engineer
you
have
always
shown
much
deference
to
my
advice
will
you
in
this
matter
yield
to
me
i
will
do
as
you
please
captain
harding
answered
the
sailor
who
was
not
at
all
convinced
very
well
wait
and
we
will
not
attack
them
unless
we
are
attacked
first
thus
their
behavior
towards
the
pirates
was
agreed
upon
although
pencroft
augured
nothing
good
from
it
they
were
not
to
attack
them
but
were
to
be
on
their
guard
after
all
the
island
was
large
and
fertile
if
any
sentiment
of
honesty
yet
remained
in
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
these
wretches
might
perhaps
be
reclaimed
was
it
not
their
interest
in
the
situation
in
which
they
found
themselves
to
begin
a
new
life
at
any
rate
for
humanitys
sake
alone
it
would
be
right
to
wait
the
colonists
would
no
longer
as
before
be
able
to
go
and
come
without
fear
hitherto
they
had
only
wild
beasts
to
guard
against
and
now
six
convicts
of
the
worst
description
perhaps
were
roaming
over
their
island
it
was
serious
certainly
and
to
less
brave
men
it
would
have
been
security
lost
no
matter
at
present
the
colonists
had
reason
on
their
side
against
pencroft
would
they
be
right
in
the
future
that
remained
to
be
seen
chapter
6
however
the
chief
business
of
the
colonists
was
to
make
that
complete
exploration
of
the
island
which
had
been
decided
upon
and
which
would
have
two
objects
to
discover
the
mysterious
being
whose
existence
was
now
indisputable
and
at
the
same
time
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
the
pirates
what
retreat
they
had
chosen
what
sort
of
life
they
were
leading
and
what
was
to
be
feared
from
them
cyrus
harding
wished
to
set
out
without
delay
but
as
the
expedition
would
be
of
some
days
duration
it
appeared
best
to
load
the
cart
with
different
materials
and
tools
in
order
to
facilitate
the
organization
of
the
encampments
one
of
the
onagers
however
having
hurt
its
leg
could
not
be
harnessed
at
present
and
a
few
days
rest
was
necessary
the
departure
was
therefore
put
off
for
a
week
until
the
20th
of
november
the
month
of
november
in
this
latitude
corresponds
to
the
month
of
may
in
the
northern
zones
it
was
therefore
the
fine
season
the
sun
was
entering
the
tropic
of
capricorn
and
gave
the
longest
days
in
the
year
the
time
was
therefore
very
favorable
for
the
projected
expedition
which
if
it
did
not
accomplish
its
principal
object
would
at
any
rate
be
fruitful
in
discoveries
especially
of
natural
productions
since
harding
proposed
to
explore
those
dense
forests
of
the
far
west
which
stretched
to
the
extremity
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
during
the
nine
days
which
preceded
their
departure
it
was
agreed
that
the
work
on
prospect
heights
should
be
finished
off
moreover
it
was
necessary
for
ayrton
to
return
to
the
corral
where
the
domesticated
animals
required
his
care
it
was
decided
that
he
should
spend
two
days
there
and
return
to
granite
house
after
having
liberally
supplied
the
stables
as
he
was
about
to
start
harding
asked
him
if
he
would
not
like
one
of
them
to
accompany
him
observing
that
the
island
was
less
safe
than
formerly
ayrton
replied
that
this
was
unnecessary
as
he
was
enough
for
the
work
and
that
besides
he
apprehended
no
danger
if
anything
occurred
at
the
corral
or
in
the
neighborhood
he
could
instantly
warn
the
colonists
by
sending
a
telegram
to
granite
house
ayrton
departed
at
dawn
on
the
9th
taking
the
cart
drawn
by
one
onager
and
two
hours
after
the
electric
wire
announced
that
he
had
found
all
in
order
at
the
corral
during
these
two
days
harding
busied
himself
in
executing
a
project
which
would
completely
guard
granite
house
against
any
surprise
it
was
necessary
to
completely
conceal
the
opening
of
the
old
outlet
which
was
already
walled
up
and
partly
hidden
under
grass
and
plants
at
the
southern
angle
of
lake
grant
nothing
was
easier
since
if
the
level
of
the
lake
was
raised
two
or
three
feet
the
opening
would
be
quite
beneath
it
now
to
raise
this
level
they
had
only
to
establish
a
dam
at
the
two
openings
made
by
the
lake
and
by
which
were
fed
creek
glycerine
and
falls
river
the
colonists
worked
with
a
will
and
the
two
dams
which
besides
did
not
exceed
eight
feet
in
width
by
three
in
height
were
rapidly
erected
by
means
of
wellcemented
blocks
of
stone
this
work
finished
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
guess
that
at
that
part
of
the
lake
there
existed
a
subterranean
passage
through
which
the
overflow
of
the
lake
formerly
escaped
of
course
the
little
stream
which
fed
the
reservoir
of
granite
house
and
worked
the
lift
had
been
carefully
preserved
and
the
water
could
not
fail
the
lift
once
raised
this
sure
and
comfortable
retreat
would
be
safe
from
any
surprise
this
work
had
been
so
quickly
done
that
pencroft
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
found
time
to
make
an
expedition
to
port
balloon
the
sailor
was
very
anxious
to
know
if
the
little
creek
in
which
the
bonadventure
was
moored
had
been
visited
by
the
convicts
these
gentlemen
he
observed
landed
on
the
south
coast
and
if
they
followed
the
shore
it
is
to
be
feared
that
they
may
have
discovered
the
little
harbor
and
in
that
case
i
wouldnt
give
halfadollar
for
our
bonadventure
pencrofts
apprehensions
were
not
without
foundation
and
a
visit
to
port
balloon
appeared
to
be
very
desirable
the
sailor
and
his
companions
set
off
on
the
10th
of
november
after
dinner
well
armed
pencroft
ostentatiously
slipping
two
bullets
into
each
barrel
of
his
rifle
shook
his
head
in
a
way
which
betokened
nothing
good
to
any
one
who
approached
too
near
him
whether
man
or
beast
as
he
said
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
also
took
their
guns
and
about
three
oclock
all
three
left
granite
house
neb
accompanied
them
to
the
turn
of
the
mercy
and
after
they
had
crossed
he
raised
the
bridge
it
was
agreed
that
a
gunshot
should
announce
the
colonists
return
and
that
at
the
signal
neb
should
return
and
reestablish
the
communication
between
the
two
banks
of
the
river
the
little
band
advanced
directly
along
the
road
which
led
to
the
southern
coast
of
the
island
this
was
only
a
distance
of
three
miles
and
a
half
but
gideon
spilett
and
his
companions
took
two
hours
to
traverse
it
they
examined
all
the
border
of
the
road
the
thick
forest
as
well
as
tabor
marsh
they
found
no
trace
of
the
fugitives
who
no
doubt
not
having
yet
discovered
the
number
of
the
colonists
or
the
means
of
defense
which
they
had
at
their
disposal
had
gained
the
less
accessible
parts
of
the
island
arrived
at
port
balloon
pencroft
saw
with
extreme
satisfaction
that
the
bonadventure
was
tranquilly
floating
in
the
narrow
creek
however
port
balloon
was
so
well
hidden
among
high
rocks
that
it
could
scarcely
be
discovered
either
from
the
land
or
the
sea
come
said
pencroft
the
blackguards
have
not
been
there
yet
long
grass
suits
reptiles
best
and
evidently
we
shall
find
them
in
the
far
west
and
its
very
lucky
for
if
they
had
found
the
bonadventure
added
herbert
they
would
have
gone
off
in
her
and
we
should
have
been
prevented
from
returning
to
tabor
island
indeed
remarked
the
reporter
it
will
be
important
to
take
a
document
there
which
will
make
known
the
situation
of
lincoln
island
and
ayrtons
new
residence
in
case
the
scotch
yacht
returns
to
fetch
him
well
the
bonadventure
is
always
there
mr
spilett
answered
the
sailor
she
and
her
crew
are
ready
to
start
at
a
moments
notice
i
think
pencroft
that
that
is
a
thing
to
be
done
after
our
exploration
of
the
island
is
finished
it
is
possible
after
all
that
the
stranger
if
we
manage
to
find
him
may
know
as
much
about
tabor
island
as
about
lincoln
island
do
not
forget
that
he
is
certainly
the
author
of
the
document
and
he
may
perhaps
know
how
far
we
may
count
on
the
return
of
the
yacht
but
exclaimed
pencroft
who
in
the
world
can
he
be
the
fellow
knows
us
and
we
know
nothing
about
him
if
he
is
a
simple
castaway
why
should
he
conceal
himself
we
are
honest
men
i
suppose
and
the
society
of
honest
men
isnt
unpleasant
to
any
one
did
he
come
here
voluntarily
can
he
leave
the
island
if
he
likes
is
he
here
still
will
he
remain
any
longer
chatting
thus
pencroft
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
got
on
board
and
looked
about
the
deck
of
the
bonadventure
all
at
once
the
sailor
having
examined
the
bitts
to
which
the
cable
of
the
anchor
was
secured
hallo
he
cried
this
is
queer
what
is
the
matter
pencroft
asked
the
reporter
the
matter
is
that
it
was
not
i
who
made
this
knot
and
pencroft
showed
a
rope
which
fastened
the
cable
to
the
bitt
itself
what
it
was
not
you
asked
gideon
spilett
no
i
can
swear
to
it
this
is
a
reef
knot
and
i
always
make
a
running
bowline
you
must
be
mistaken
pencroft
i
am
not
mistaken
declared
the
sailor
my
hand
does
it
so
naturally
and
ones
hand
is
never
mistaken
then
can
the
convicts
have
been
on
board
asked
herbert
i
know
nothing
about
that
answered
pencroft
but
what
is
certain
is
that
some
one
has
weighed
the
bonadventures
anchor
and
dropped
it
again
and
look
here
here
is
another
proof
the
cable
of
the
anchor
has
been
run
out
and
its
service
is
no
longer
at
the
hawsehole
i
repeat
that
some
one
has
been
using
our
vessel
but
if
the
convicts
had
used
her
they
would
have
pillaged
her
or
rather
gone
off
with
her
gone
off
where
toto
tabor
island
replied
pencroft
do
you
think
they
would
risk
themselves
in
a
boat
of
such
small
tonnage
we
must
besides
be
sure
that
they
know
of
the
islet
rejoined
the
reporter
however
that
may
be
said
the
sailor
as
sure
as
my
name
is
bonadventure
pencroft
of
the
vineyard
our
bonadventure
has
sailed
without
us
the
sailor
was
positive
that
neither
gideon
spilett
nor
herbert
could
dispute
his
statement
it
was
evident
that
the
vessel
had
been
moved
more
or
less
since
pencroft
had
brought
her
to
port
balloon
as
to
the
sailor
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
anchor
had
been
raised
and
then
dropped
again
now
what
was
the
use
of
these
two
maneuvers
unless
the
vessel
had
been
employed
in
some
expedition
but
how
was
it
we
did
not
see
the
bonadventure
pass
in
the
sight
of
the
island
observed
the
reporter
who
was
anxious
to
bring
forward
every
possible
objection
why
mr
spilett
replied
the
sailor
they
would
only
have
to
start
in
the
night
with
a
good
breeze
and
they
would
be
out
of
sight
of
the
island
in
two
hours
well
resumed
gideon
spilett
i
ask
again
what
object
could
the
convicts
have
had
in
using
the
bonadventure
and
why
after
they
had
made
use
of
her
should
they
have
brought
her
back
to
port
why
mr
spilett
replied
the
sailor
we
must
put
that
among
the
unaccountable
things
and
not
think
anything
more
about
it
the
chief
thing
is
that
the
bonadventure
was
there
and
she
is
there
now
only
unfortunately
if
the
convicts
take
her
a
second
time
we
shall
very
likely
not
find
her
again
in
her
place
then
pencroft
said
herbert
would
it
not
be
wisest
to
bring
the
bonadventure
off
to
granite
house
yes
and
no
answered
pencroft
or
rather
no
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
is
a
bad
place
for
a
vessel
and
the
sea
is
heavy
there
but
by
hauling
her
up
on
the
sand
to
the
foot
of
the
chimneys
perhaps
yes
replied
pencroft
at
any
rate
since
we
must
leave
granite
house
for
a
long
expedition
i
think
the
bonadventure
will
be
safer
here
during
our
absence
and
we
shall
do
best
to
leave
her
here
until
the
island
is
rid
of
these
blackguards
that
is
exactly
my
opinion
said
the
reporter
at
any
rate
in
the
event
of
bad
weather
she
will
not
be
exposed
here
as
she
would
be
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
but
suppose
the
convicts
pay
her
another
visit
said
herbert
well
my
boy
replied
pencroft
not
finding
her
here
they
would
not
be
long
in
finding
her
on
the
sands
of
granite
house
and
during
our
absence
nothing
could
hinder
them
from
seizing
her
i
agree
therefore
with
mr
spilett
that
she
must
be
left
in
port
balloon
but
if
on
our
return
we
have
not
rid
the
island
of
those
rascals
it
will
be
prudent
to
bring
our
boat
to
granite
house
until
the
time
when
we
need
not
fear
any
unpleasant
visits
thats
settled
let
us
be
off
said
the
reporter
pencroft
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
on
their
return
to
granite
house
told
the
engineer
all
that
had
passed
and
the
latter
approved
of
their
arrangements
both
for
the
present
and
the
future
he
also
promised
the
sailor
that
he
would
study
that
part
of
the
channel
situated
between
the
islet
and
the
coast
so
as
to
ascertain
if
it
would
not
be
possible
to
make
an
artificial
harbor
there
by
means
of
dams
in
this
way
the
bonadventure
would
be
always
within
reach
under
the
eyes
of
the
colonists
and
if
necessary
under
lock
and
key
that
evening
a
telegram
was
sent
to
ayrton
requesting
him
to
bring
from
the
corral
a
couple
of
goats
which
neb
wished
to
acclimatize
to
the
plateau
singularly
enough
ayrton
did
not
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
the
despatch
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
this
could
not
but
astonish
the
engineer
but
it
might
be
that
ayrton
was
not
at
that
moment
in
the
corral
or
even
that
he
was
on
his
way
back
to
granite
house
in
fact
two
days
had
already
passed
since
his
departure
and
it
had
been
decided
that
on
the
evening
of
the
10th
or
at
the
latest
the
morning
of
the
11th
he
should
return
the
colonists
waited
therefore
for
ayrton
to
appear
on
prospect
heights
neb
and
herbert
even
watched
at
the
bridge
so
as
to
be
ready
to
lower
it
the
moment
their
companion
presented
himself
but
up
to
ten
in
the
evening
there
were
no
signs
of
ayrton
it
was
therefore
judged
best
to
send
a
fresh
despatch
requiring
an
immediate
reply
the
bell
of
the
telegraph
at
granite
house
remained
mute
the
colonists
uneasiness
was
great
what
had
happened
was
ayrton
no
longer
at
the
corral
or
if
he
was
still
there
had
he
no
longer
control
over
his
movements
could
they
go
to
the
corral
in
this
dark
night
they
consulted
some
wished
to
go
the
others
to
remain
but
said
herbert
perhaps
some
accident
has
happened
to
the
telegraphic
apparatus
so
that
it
works
no
longer
that
may
be
said
the
reporter
wait
till
tomorrow
replied
cyrus
harding
it
is
possible
indeed
that
ayrton
has
not
received
our
despatch
or
even
that
we
have
not
received
his
they
waited
of
course
not
without
some
anxiety
at
dawn
of
day
the
11th
of
november
harding
again
sent
the
electric
current
along
the
wire
and
received
no
reply
he
tried
again
the
same
result
off
to
the
corral
said
he
and
well
armed
added
pencroft
it
was
immediately
decided
that
granite
house
should
not
be
left
alone
and
that
neb
should
remain
there
after
having
accompanied
his
friends
to
creek
glycerine
he
raised
the
bridge
and
waiting
behind
a
tree
he
watched
for
the
return
of
either
his
companions
or
ayrton
in
the
event
of
the
pirates
presenting
themselves
and
attempting
to
force
the
passage
he
was
to
endeavor
to
stop
them
by
firing
on
them
and
as
a
last
resource
he
was
to
take
refuge
in
granite
house
where
the
lift
once
raised
he
would
be
in
safety
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
herbert
and
pencroft
were
to
repair
to
the
corral
and
if
they
did
not
find
ayrton
search
the
neighboring
woods
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
the
engineer
and
his
three
companions
had
passed
creek
glycerine
and
neb
posted
himself
behind
a
small
mound
crowned
by
several
dragon
trees
on
the
left
bank
of
the
stream
the
colonists
after
leaving
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
immediately
took
the
road
to
the
corral
they
shouldered
their
guns
ready
to
fire
on
the
slightest
hostile
demonstration
the
two
rifles
and
the
two
guns
had
been
loaded
with
ball
the
wood
was
thick
on
each
side
of
the
road
and
might
easily
have
concealed
the
convicts
who
owing
to
their
weapons
would
have
been
really
formidable
the
colonists
walked
rapidly
and
in
silence
top
preceded
them
sometimes
running
on
the
road
sometimes
taking
a
ramble
into
the
wood
but
always
quiet
and
not
appearing
to
fear
anything
unusual
and
they
could
be
sure
that
the
faithful
dog
would
not
allow
them
to
be
surprised
but
would
bark
at
the
least
appearance
of
danger
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
followed
beside
the
road
the
wire
which
connected
the
corral
with
granite
house
after
walking
for
nearly
two
miles
they
had
not
as
yet
discovered
any
explanation
of
the
difficulty
the
posts
were
in
good
order
the
wire
regularly
extended
however
at
that
moment
the
engineer
observed
that
the
wire
appeared
to
be
slack
and
on
arriving
at
post
no
74
herbert
who
was
in
advance
stopped
exclaiming
the
wire
is
broken
his
companions
hurried
forward
and
arrived
at
the
spot
where
the
lad
was
standing
the
post
was
rooted
up
and
lying
across
the
path
the
unexpected
explanation
of
the
difficulty
was
here
and
it
was
evident
that
the
despatches
from
granite
house
had
not
been
received
at
the
corral
nor
those
from
the
corral
at
granite
house
it
wasnt
the
wind
that
blew
down
this
post
observed
pencroft
no
replied
gideon
spilett
the
earth
has
been
dug
up
round
its
foot
and
it
has
been
torn
up
by
the
hand
of
man
besides
the
wire
is
broken
added
herbert
showing
that
the
wire
had
been
snapped
is
the
fracture
recent
asked
harding
yes
answered
herbert
it
has
certainly
been
done
quite
lately
to
the
corral
to
the
corral
exclaimed
the
sailor
the
colonists
were
now
half
way
between
granite
house
and
the
corral
having
still
two
miles
and
a
half
to
go
they
pressed
forward
with
redoubled
speed
indeed
it
was
to
be
feared
that
some
serious
accident
had
occurred
in
the
corral
no
doubt
ayrton
might
have
sent
a
telegram
which
had
not
arrived
but
this
was
not
the
reason
why
his
companions
were
so
uneasy
for
a
more
unaccountable
circumstance
ayrton
who
had
promised
to
return
the
evening
before
had
not
reappeared
in
short
it
was
not
without
a
motive
that
all
communication
had
been
stopped
between
the
corral
and
granite
house
and
who
but
the
convicts
could
have
any
interest
in
interrupting
this
communication
the
settlers
hastened
on
their
hearts
oppressed
with
anxiety
they
were
sincerely
attached
to
their
new
companion
were
they
to
find
him
struck
down
by
the
hands
of
those
of
whom
he
was
formerly
the
leader
soon
they
arrived
at
the
place
where
the
road
led
along
the
side
of
the
little
stream
which
flowed
from
the
red
creek
and
watered
the
meadows
of
the
corral
they
then
moderated
their
pace
so
that
they
should
not
be
out
of
breath
at
the
moment
when
a
struggle
might
be
necessary
their
guns
were
in
their
hands
ready
cocked
the
forest
was
watched
on
every
side
top
uttered
sullen
groans
which
were
rather
ominous
at
last
the
palisade
appeared
through
the
trees
no
trace
of
any
damage
could
be
seen
the
gate
was
shut
as
usual
deep
silence
reigned
in
the
corral
neither
the
accustomed
bleating
of
the
sheep
nor
ayrtons
voice
could
be
heard
let
us
enter
said
cyrus
harding
and
the
engineer
advanced
while
his
companions
keeping
watch
about
twenty
paces
behind
him
were
ready
to
fire
at
a
moments
notice
harding
raised
the
inner
latch
of
the
gate
and
was
about
to
push
it
back
when
top
barked
loudly
a
report
sounded
and
was
responded
to
by
a
cry
of
pain
herbert
struck
by
a
bullet
lay
stretched
on
the
ground

my

cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
ran
to
herbert
the
reporter
listened
to
ascertain
if
the
poor
lads
heart
was
still
beating
he
lives
said
he
but
he
must
be
carried
to
granite
house
that
is
impossible
replied
the
engineer
into
the
corral
then
said
pencroft
in
a
moment
said
harding
and
he
ran
round
the
left
corner
of
the
palisade
there
he
found
a
convict
who
aiming
at
him
sent
a
ball
through
his
hat
in
a
few
seconds
before
he
had
even
time
to
fire
his
second
barrel
he
fell
struck
to
the
heart
by
hardings
dagger
more
sure
even
than
his
gun
during
this
time
gideon
spilett
and
the
sailor
hoisted
themselves
over
the
palisade
leaped
into
the
enclosure
threw
down
the
props
which
supported
the
inner
door
ran
into
the
empty
house
and
soon
poor
herbert
was
lying
on
ayrtons
bed
in
a
few
moments
harding
was
by
his
side
on
seeing
herbert
senseless
the
sailors
grief
was
terrible
he
sobbed
he
cried
he
tried
to
beat
his
head
against
the
wall
neither
the
engineer
nor
the
reporter
could
calm
him
they
themselves
were
choked
with
emotion
they
could
not
speak
however
they
knew
that
it
depended
on
them
to
rescue
from
death
the
poor
boy
who
was
suffering
beneath
their
eyes
gideon
spilett
had
not
passed
through
the
many
incidents
by
which
his
life
had
been
checkered
without
acquiring
some
slight
knowledge
of
medicine
he
knew
a
little
of
everything
and
several
times
he
had
been
obliged
to
attend
to
wounds
produced
either
by
a
swordbayonet
or
shot
assisted
by
cyrus
harding
he
proceeded
to
render
the
aid
herbert
required
the
reporter
was
immediately
struck
by
the
complete
stupor
in
which
herbert
lay
a
stupor
owing
either
to
the
hemorrhage
or
to
the
shock
the
ball
having
struck
a
bone
with
sufficient
force
to
produce
a
violent
concussion
herbert
was
deadly
pale
and
his
pulse
so
feeble
that
spilett
only
felt
it
beat
at
long
intervals
as
if
it
was
on
the
point
of
stopping
these
symptoms
were
very
serious
herberts
chest
was
laid
bare
and
the
blood
having
been
stanched
with
handkerchiefs
it
was
bathed
with
cold
water
the
contusion
or
rather
the
contused
wound
appearedan
oval
below
the
chest
between
the
third
and
fourth
ribs
it
was
there
that
herbert
had
been
hit
by
the
bullet
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
then
turned
the
poor
boy
over
as
they
did
so
he
uttered
a
moan
so
feeble
that
they
almost
thought
it
was
his
last
sigh
herberts
back
was
covered
with
blood
from
another
contused
wound
by
which
the
ball
had
immediately
escaped
god
be
praised
said
the
reporter
the
ball
is
not
in
the
body
and
we
shall
not
have
to
extract
it
but
the
heart
asked
harding
the
heart
has
not
been
touched
if
it
had
been
herbert
would
be
dead
dead
exclaimed
pencroft
with
a
groan
the
sailor
had
only
heard
the
last
words
uttered
by
the
reporter
no
pencroft
replied
cyrus
harding
no
he
is
not
dead
his
pulse
still
beats
he
has
even
uttered
a
moan
but
for
your
boys
sake
calm
yourself
we
have
need
of
all
our
selfpossession
do
not
make
us
lose
it
my
friend
pencroft
was
silent
but
a
reaction
set
in
and
great
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
in
the
meanwhile
gideon
spilett
endeavored
to
collect
his
ideas
and
proceed
methodically
after
his
examination
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
ball
entering
in
front
between
the
seventh
and
eighth
ribs
had
issued
behind
between
the
third
and
fourth
but
what
mischief
had
the
ball
committed
in
its
passage
what
important
organs
had
been
reached
a
professional
surgeon
would
have
had
difficulty
in
determining
this
at
once
and
still
more
so
the
reporter
however
he
knew
one
thing
this
was
that
he
would
have
to
prevent
the
inflammatory
strangulation
of
the
injured
parts
then
to
contend
with
the
local
inflammation
and
fever
which
would
result
from
the
wound
perhaps
mortal
now
what
styptics
what
antiphlogistics
ought
to
be
employed
by
what
means
could
inflammation
be
prevented
at
any
rate
the
most
important
thing
was
that
the
two
wounds
should
be
dressed
without
delay
it
did
not
appear
necessary
to
gideon
spilett
that
a
fresh
flow
of
blood
should
be
caused
by
bathing
them
in
tepid
water
and
compressing
their
lips
the
hemorrhage
had
been
very
abundant
and
herbert
was
already
too
much
enfeebled
by
the
loss
of
blood
the
reporter
therefore
thought
it
best
to
simply
bathe
the
two
wounds
with
cold
water
herbert
was
placed
on
his
left
side
and
was
maintained
in
that
position
he
must
not
be
moved
said
gideon
spilett
he
is
in
the
most
favorable
position
for
the
wounds
in
his
back
and
chest
to
suppurate
easily
and
absolute
rest
is
necessary
what
cant
we
carry
him
to
granite
house
asked
pencroft
no
pencroft
replied
the
reporter
ill
pay
the
villains
off
cried
the
sailor
shaking
his
fist
in
a
menacing
manner
pencroft
said
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
had
resumed
his
examination
of
the
wounded
boy
herbert
was
still
so
frightfully
pale
that
the
reporter
felt
anxious
cyrus
said
he
i
am
not
a
surgeon
i
am
in
terrible
perplexity
you
must
aid
me
with
your
advice
your
experience
take
courage
my
friend
answered
the
engineer
pressing
the
reporters
hand
judge
coolly
think
only
of
this
herbert
must
be
saved
these
words
restored
to
gideon
spilett
that
selfpossession
which
he
had
lost
in
a
moment
of
discouragement
on
feeling
his
great
responsibility
he
seated
himself
close
to
the
bed
cyrus
harding
stood
near
pencroft
had
torn
up
his
shirt
and
was
mechanically
making
lint
spilett
then
explained
to
cyrus
harding
that
he
thought
he
ought
first
of
all
to
stop
the
hemorrhage
but
not
close
the
two
wounds
or
cause
their
immediate
cicatrization
for
there
had
been
internal
perforation
and
the
suppuration
must
not
be
allowed
to
accumulate
in
the
chest
harding
approved
entirely
and
it
was
decided
that
the
two
wounds
should
be
dressed
without
attempting
to
close
them
by
immediate
coaptation
and
now
did
the
colonists
possess
an
efficacious
agent
to
act
against
the
inflammation
which
might
occur
yes
they
had
one
for
nature
had
generously
lavished
it
they
had
cold
water
that
is
to
say
the
most
powerful
sedative
that
can
be
employed
against
inflammation
of
wounds
the
most
efficacious
therapeutic
agent
in
grave
cases
and
the
one
which
is
now
adopted
by
all
physicians
cold
water
has
moreover
the
advantage
of
leaving
the
wound
in
absolute
rest
and
preserving
it
from
all
premature
dressing
a
considerable
advantage
since
it
has
been
found
by
experience
that
contact
with
the
air
is
dangerous
during
the
first
days
gideon
spilett
and
cyrus
harding
reasoned
thus
with
their
simple
good
sense
and
they
acted
as
the
best
surgeon
would
have
done
compresses
of
linen
were
applied
to
poor
herberts
two
wounds
and
were
kept
constantly
wet
with
cold
water
the
sailor
had
at
first
lighted
a
fire
in
the
hut
which
was
not
wanting
in
things
necessary
for
life
maple
sugar
medicinal
plants
the
same
which
the
lad
had
gathered
on
the
banks
of
lake
grant
enabled
them
to
make
some
refreshing
drinks
which
they
gave
him
without
his
taking
any
notice
of
it
his
fever
was
extremely
high
and
all
that
day
and
night
passed
without
his
becoming
conscious
herberts
life
hung
on
a
thread
and
this
thread
might
break
at
any
moment
the
next
day
the
12th
of
november
the
hopes
of
harding
and
his
companions
slightly
revived
herbert
had
come
out
of
his
long
stupor
he
opened
his
eyes
he
recognized
cyrus
harding
the
reporter
and
pencroft
he
uttered
two
or
three
words
he
did
not
know
what
had
happened
they
told
him
and
spilett
begged
him
to
remain
perfectly
still
telling
him
that
his
life
was
not
in
danger
and
that
his
wounds
would
heal
in
a
few
days
however
herbert
scarcely
suffered
at
all
and
the
cold
water
with
which
they
were
constantly
bathed
prevented
any
inflammation
of
the
wounds
the
suppuration
was
established
in
a
regular
way
the
fever
did
not
increase
and
it
might
now
be
hoped
that
this
terrible
wound
would
not
involve
any
catastrophe
pencroft
felt
the
swelling
of
his
heart
gradually
subside
he
was
like
a
sister
of
mercy
like
a
mother
by
the
bed
of
her
child
herbert
dozed
again
but
his
sleep
appeared
more
natural
tell
me
again
that
you
hope
mr
spilett
said
pencroft
tell
me
again
that
you
will
save
herbert
yes
we
will
save
him
replied
the
reporter
the
wound
is
serious
and
perhaps
even
the
ball
has
traversed
the
lungs
but
the
perforation
of
this
organ
is
not
fatal
god
bless
you
answered
pencroft
as
may
be
believed
during
the
fourandtwenty
hours
they
had
been
in
the
corral
the
colonists
had
no
other
thought
than
that
of
nursing
herbert
they
did
not
think
either
of
the
danger
which
threatened
them
should
the
convicts
return
or
of
the
precautions
to
be
taken
for
the
future
but
on
this
day
while
pencroft
watched
by
the
sickbed
cyrus
harding
and
the
reporter
consulted
as
to
what
it
would
be
best
to
do
first
of
all
they
examined
the
corral
there
was
not
a
trace
of
ayrton
had
the
unhappy
man
been
dragged
away
by
his
former
accomplices
had
he
resisted
and
been
overcome
in
the
struggle
this
last
supposition
was
only
too
probable
gideon
spilett
at
the
moment
he
scaled
the
palisade
had
clearly
seen
some
one
of
the
convicts
running
along
the
southern
spur
of
mount
franklin
towards
whom
top
had
sprung
it
was
one
of
those
whose
object
had
been
so
completely
defeated
by
the
rocks
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
besides
the
one
killed
by
harding
and
whose
body
was
found
outside
the
enclosure
of
course
belonged
to
bob
harveys
crew
as
to
the
corral
it
had
not
suffered
any
damage
the
gates
were
closed
and
the
animals
had
not
been
able
to
disperse
in
the
forest
nor
could
they
see
traces
of
any
struggle
any
devastation
either
in
the
hut
or
in
the
palisade
the
ammunition
only
with
which
ayrton
had
been
supplied
had
disappeared
with
him
the
unhappy
man
has
been
surprised
said
harding
and
as
he
was
a
man
to
defend
himself
he
must
have
been
overpowered
yes
that
is
to
be
feared
said
the
reporter
then
doubtless
the
convicts
installed
themselves
in
the
corral
where
they
found
plenty
of
everything
and
only
fled
when
they
saw
us
coming
it
is
very
evident
too
that
at
this
moment
ayrton
whether
living
or
dead
is
not
here
we
shall
have
to
beat
the
forest
said
the
engineer
and
rid
the
island
of
these
wretches
pencrofts
presentiments
were
not
mistaken
when
he
wished
to
hunt
them
as
wild
beasts
that
would
have
spared
us
all
these
misfortunes
yes
answered
the
reporter
but
now
we
have
the
right
to
be
merciless
at
any
rate
said
the
engineer
we
are
obliged
to
wait
some
time
and
to
remain
at
the
corral
until
we
can
carry
herbert
without
danger
to
granite
house
but
neb
asked
the
reporter
neb
is
in
safety
but
if
uneasy
at
our
absence
he
would
venture
to
come
he
must
not
come
returned
cyrus
harding
quickly
he
would
be
murdered
on
the
road
it
is
very
probable
however
that
he
will
attempt
to
rejoin
us
ah
if
the
telegraph
still
acted
he
might
be
warned
but
that
is
impossible
now
as
to
leaving
pencroft
and
herbert
here
alone
we
could
not
do
it
well
i
will
go
alone
to
granite
house
no
no
cyrus
answered
the
reporter
you
must
not
expose
yourself
your
courage
would
be
of
no
avail
the
villains
are
evidently
watching
the
corral
they
are
hidden
in
the
thick
woods
which
surround
it
and
if
you
go
we
shall
soon
have
to
regret
two
misfortunes
instead
of
one
but
neb
repeated
the
engineer
it
is
now
fourandtwenty
hours
since
he
has
had
any
news
of
us
he
will
be
sure
to
come
and
as
he
will
be
less
on
his
guard
than
we
should
be
ourselves
added
spilett
he
will
be
killed
is
there
really
no
way
of
warning
him
while
the
engineer
thought
his
eyes
fell
on

going
backwards
and
forwards
seemed
to

the

sprang
at
his

top
will
go
said
the
reporter
who
had
understood
the
engineer
top
can
go
where
we
cannot
he
will
carry
to
granite
house
the
news
of
the
corral
and
he
will
bring
back
to
us

from

quick
said
harding
quick
spilett
rapidly
tore
a
leaf
from
his
notebook
and
wrote
these
words

in

by

this
laconic
note
contained
all
that

at
the

at
these
words
he
understood
he
knew
what
was
expected
of
him
the
road
to
the
corral
was
familiar
to
him
in
less
than
an
hour
he
could
clear
it
and
it
might
be
hoped
that
where
neither
cyrus
harding
nor
the
reporter
could
have
ventured
without
danger
top
running
among
the
grass
or
in
the
wood

pass
unperceived
the

went
to
the

repeated
the

again
pointing
in

sprang
forwards
then
almost
immediately
disappeared
he
will
get
there
said
the
reporter
yes
and
he
will
come
back
the
faithful
animal
what
oclock
is
it
asked
gideon
spilett
ten
in
an
hour
he
may
be
here
we
will
watch
for
his
return
the
gate
of
the
corral
was
closed
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
reentered
the
house
herbert

still
in
a
sleep
pencroft

the
compresses
always
wet
spilett
seeing
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
at
that
moment
busied
himself
in
preparing
some
nourishment
while
attentively
watching
that
part
of
the
enclosure
against
the
hill
at
which
an
attack
might
be
expected
the
settlers
awaited
tops
return
with
much
anxiety
a
little
before
eleven
oclock
cyrus
harding
and
the
reporter
rifle
in
hand
were
behind
the
gate
ready
to
open
it
at
the
first
bark
of
their
dog
they
did
not
doubt
that
if
top
had
arrived
safely
at
granite
house
neb
would
have
sent
him
back
immediately
they
had
both
been
there
for
about
ten
minutes
when
a
report
was
heard
followed
by
repeated
barks
the
engineer
opened
the
gate
and
seeing
smoke
a
hundred
feet
off
in
the
wood
he
fired
in
that
direction
almost
immediately

bounded
into

the

taking

chapter
8
so
the
convicts
were
still
there
watching
the
corral
and
determined
to
kill
the
settlers
one
after
the
other
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
treat
them
as
wild
beasts
but
great
precautions
must
be
taken
for
just
now
the
wretches
had
the
advantage
on
their
side
seeing
and
not
being
seen
being
able
to
surprise
by
the
suddenness
of
their
attack
yet
not
to
be
surprised
themselves
harding
made
arrangements
therefore
for
living
in
the
corral
of
which
the
provisions
would
last
for
a
tolerable
length
of
time
ayrtons
house
had
been
provided
with
all
that
was
necessary
for
existence
and
the
convicts
scared
by
the
arrival
of
the
settlers
had
not
had
time
to
pillage
it
it
was
probable
as
gideon
spilett
observed
that
things
had
occurred
as
follows
the
six
convicts
disembarking
on
the
island
had
followed
the
southern
shore
and
after
having
traversed
the
double
shore
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
not
being
inclined
to
venture
into
the
far
west
woods
they
had
reached
the
mouth
of
falls
river
from
this
point
by
following
the
right
bank
of
the
watercourse
they
would
arrive
at
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
among
which
they
would
naturally
seek
a
retreat
and
they
could
not
have
been
long
in
discovering
the
corral
then
uninhabited
there
they
had
regularly
installed
themselves
awaiting
the
moment
to
put
their
abominable
schemes
into
execution
ayrtons
arrival
had
surprised
them
but
they
had
managed
to
overpower
the
unfortunate
man
andthe
rest
may
be
easily
imagined
now
the
convictsreduced
to
five
it
is
true
but
well
armedwere
roaming
the
woods
and
to
venture
there
was
to
expose
themselves
to
their
attacks
which
could
be
neither
guarded
against
nor
prevented
wait
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
repeated
cyrus
harding
when
herbert
is
cured
we
can
organize
a
general
battle
of
the
island
and
have
satisfaction
of
these
convicts
that
will
be
the
object
of
our
grand
expedition
at
the
same
time
as
the
search
for
our
mysterious
protector
added
gideon
spilett
finishing
the
engineers
sentence
and
it
must
be
acknowledged
my
dear
cyrus
that
this
time
his
protection
was
wanting
at
the
very
moment
when
it
was
most
necessary
to
us
who
knows
replied
the
engineer
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
reporter
that
we
are
not
at
the
end
of
our
trouble
yet
my
dear
spilett
and
that
his
powerful
intervention
may
have
another
opportunity
of
exercising
itself
but
that
is
not
the
question
now
herberts
life
before
everything
this
was
the
colonists
saddest
thought
several
days
passed
and
the
poor
boys
state
was
happily
no
worse
cold
water
always
kept
at
a
suitable
temperature
had
completely
prevented
the
inflammation
of
the
wounds
it
even
seemed
to
the
reporter
that
this
water
being
slightly
sulphurouswhich
was
explained
by
the
neighborhood
of
the
volcano
had
a
more
direct
action
on
the
healing
the
suppuration
was
much
less
abundant
and
thanks
to
the
incessant
care
by
which
he
was
surroundedherbert
returned
to
life
and
his
fever
abated
he
was
besides
subjected
to
a
severe
diet
and
consequently
his
weakness
was
and
would
be
extreme
but
there
was
no
want
of
refreshing
drinks
and
absolute
rest
was
of
the
greatest
benefit
to
him
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
and
pencroft
had
become
very
skilful
in
dressing
the
lads
wounds
all
the
linen
in
the
house
had
been
sacrificed
herberts
wounds
covered
with
compresses
and
lint
were
pressed
neither
too
much
nor
too
little
so
as
to
cause
their
cicatrization
without
effecting
any
inflammatory
reaction
the
reporter
used
extreme
care
in
the
dressing
knowing
well
the
importance
of
it
and
repeating
to
his
companions
that
which
most
surgeons
willingly
admit
that
it
is
perhaps
rarer
to
see
a
dressing
well
done
than
an
operation
well
performed
in
ten
days
on
the
22nd
of
november
herbert
was
considerably
better
he
had
begun
to
take
some
nourishment
the
color
was
returning
to
his
cheeks
and
his
bright
eyes
smiled
at
his
nurses
he
talked
a
little
notwithstanding
pencrofts
efforts
who
talked
incessantly
to
prevent
him
from
beginning
to
speak
and
told
him
the
most
improbable
stories
herbert
had
questioned
him
on
the
subject
of
ayrton
whom
he
was
astonished
not
to
see
near
him
thinking
that
he
was
at
the
corral
but
the
sailor
not
wishing
to
distress
herbert
contented
himself
by
replying
that
ayrton
had
rejoined
neb
so
as
to
defend
granite
house
humph
said
pencroft
these
pirates
they
are
gentlemen
who
have
no
right
to
any
consideration
and
the
captain
wanted
to
win
them
by
kindness
ill
send
them
some
kindness
but
in
the
shape
of
a
good
bullet
and
have
they
not
been
seen
again
asked
herbert
no
my
boy
answered
the
sailor
but
we
shall
find
them
and
when
you
are
cured
we
shall
see
if
the
cowards
who
strike
us
from
behind
will
dare
to
meet
us
face
to
face
i
am
still
very
weak
my
poor
pencroft
well
your
strength
will
return
gradually
whats
a
ball
through
the
chest
nothing
but
a
joke
ive
seen
many
and
i
dont
think
much
of
them
at
last
things
appeared
to
be
going
on
well
and
if
no
complication
occurred
herberts
recovery
might
be
regarded
as
certain
but
what
would
have
been
the
condition
of
the
colonists
if
his
state
had
been
aggravatedif
for
example
the
ball
had
remained
in
his
body
if
his
arm
or
his
leg
had
had
to
be
amputated
no
said
spilett
more
than
once
i
have
never
thought
of
such
a
contingency
without
shuddering
and
yet
if
it
had
been
necessary
to
operate
said
harding
one
day
to
him
you
would
not
have
hesitated
no
cyrus
said
gideon
spilett
but
thank
god
that
we
have
been
spared
this
complication
as
in
so
many
other
conjectures
the
colonists
had
appealed
to
the
logic
of
that
simple
good
sense
of
which
they
had
made
use
so
often
and
once
more
thanks
to
their
general
knowledge
it
had
succeeded
but
might
not
a
time
come
when
all
their
science
would
be
at
fault
they
were
alone
on
the
island
now
men
in
all
states
of
society
are
necessary
to
each
other
cyrus
harding
knew
this
well
and
sometimes
he
asked
if
some
circumstance
might
not
occur
which
they
would
be
powerless
to
surmount
it
appeared
to
him
besides
that
he
and
his
companions
till
then
so
fortunate
had
entered
into
an
unlucky
period
during
the
two
years
and
a
half
which
had
elapsed
since
their
escape
from
richmond
it
might
be
said
that
they
had
had
everything
their
own
way
the
island
had
abundantly
supplied
them
with
minerals
vegetables
animals
and
as
nature
had
constantly
loaded
them
their
science
had
known
how
to
take
advantage
of
what
she
offered
them
the
wellbeing
of
the
colony
was
therefore
complete
moreover
in
certain
occurrences
an
inexplicable
influence
had
come
to
their
aid
but
all
that
could
only
be
for
a
time
in
short
cyrus
harding
believed
that
fortune
had
turned
against
them
in
fact
the
convicts
ship
had
appeared
in
the
waters
of
the
island
and
if
the
pirates
had
been
so
to
speak
miraculously
destroyed
six
of
them
at
least
had
escaped
the
catastrophe
they
had
disembarked
on
the
island
and
it
was
almost
impossible
to
get
at
the
five
who
survived
ayrton
had
no
doubt
been
murdered
by
these
wretches
who
possessed
firearms
and
at
the
first
use
that
they
had
made
of
them
herbert
had
fallen
wounded
almost
mortally
were
these
the
first
blows
aimed
by
adverse
fortune
at
the
colonists
this
was
often
asked
by
harding
this
was
often
repeated
by
the
reporter
and
it
appeared
to
him
also
that
the
intervention
so
strange
yet
so
efficacious
which
till
then
had
served
them
so
well
had
now
failed
them
had
this
mysterious
being
whatever
he
was
whose
existence
could
not
be
denied
abandoned
the
island
had
he
in
his
turn
succumbed
no
reply
was
possible
to
these
questions
but
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
because
harding
and
his
companions
spoke
of
these
things
they
were
men
to
despair
far
from
that
they
looked
their
situation
in
the
face
they
analyzed
the
chances
they
prepared
themselves
for
any
event
they
stood
firm
and
straight
before
the
future
and
if
adversity
was
at
last
to
strike
them
it
would
find
in
them
men
prepared
to
struggle
against
it
chapter
9
the
convalescence
of
the
young
invalid
was
regularly
progressing
one
thing
only
was
now
to
be
desired
that
his
state
would
allow
him
to
be
brought
to
granite
house
however
well
built
and
supplied
the
corral
house
was
it
could
not
be
so
comfortable
as
the
healthy
granite
dwelling
besides
it
did
not
offer
the
same
security
and
its
tenants
notwithstanding
their
watchfulness
were
here
always
in
fear
of
some
shot
from
the
convicts
there
on
the
contrary
in
the
middle
of
that
impregnable
and
inaccessible
cliff
they
would
have
nothing
to
fear
and
any
attack
on
their
persons
would
certainly
fail
they
therefore
waited
impatiently
for
the
moment
when
herbert
might
be
moved
without
danger
from
his
wound
and
they
were
determined
to
make
this
move
although
the
communication
through
jacamar
wood
was
very
difficult
they
had
no
news
from
neb
but
were
not
uneasy
on
that
account
the
courageous
negro
well
entrenched
in
the
depths
of
granite
house
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
surprised
top
had
not
been
sent
again
to
him
as
it
appeared
useless
to
expose
the
faithful
dog
to
some
shot
which
might
deprive
the
settlers
of
their
most
useful
auxiliary
they
waited
therefore
although
they
were
anxious
to
be
reunited
at
granite
house
it
pained
the
engineer
to
see
his
forces
divided
for
it
gave
great
advantage
to
the
pirates
since
ayrtons
disappearance
they
were
only
four
against
five
for
herbert
could
not
yet
be
counted
and
this
was
not
the
least
care
of
the
brave
boy
who
well
understood
the
trouble
of
which
he
was
the
cause
the
question
of
knowing
how
in
their
condition
they
were
to
act
against
the
pirates
was
thoroughly
discussed
on
the
29th
of
november
by
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
and
pencroft
at
a
moment
when
herbert
was
asleep
and
could
not
hear
them
my
friends
said
the
reporter
after
they
had
talked
of
neb
and
of
the
impossibility
of
communicating
with
him
i
thinklike
you
that
to
venture
on
the
road
to
the
corral
would
be
to
risk
receiving
a
gunshot
without
being
able
to
return
it
but
do
you
not
think
that
the
best
thing
to
be
done
now
is
to
openly
give
chase
to
these
wretches
that
is
just
what
i
was
thinking
answered
pencroft
i
believe
were
not
fellows
to
be
afraid
of
a
bullet
and
as
for
me
if
captain
harding
approves
im
ready
to
dash
into
the
forest
why
hang
it
one
man
is
equal
to
another
but
is
he
equal
to
five
asked
the
engineer
i
will
join
pencroft
said
the
reporter
and
both
of
us
wellarmed
and
accompanied
by
top
my
dear
spilett
and
you
pencroft
answered
harding
let
us
reason
coolly
if
the
convicts
were
hid
in
one
spot
of
the
island
if
we
knew
that
spot
and
had
only
to
dislodge
them
i
would
undertake
a
direct
attack
but
is
there
not
occasion
to
fear
on
the
contrary
that
they
are
sure
to
fire
the
first
shot
well
captain
cried
pencroft
a
bullet
does
not
always
reach
its
mark
that
which
struck
herbert
did
not
miss
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
besides
observe
that
if
both
of
you
left
the
corral
i
should
remain
here
alone
to
defend
it
do
you
imagine
that
the
convicts
will
not
see
you
leave
it
that
they
will
not
allow
you
to
enter
the
forest
and
that
they
will
not
attack
it
during
your
absence
knowing
that
there
is
no
one
here
but
a
wounded
boy
and
a
man
you
are
right
captain
replied
pencroft
his
chest
swelling
with
sullen
anger
you
are
right
they
will
do
all
they
can
to
retake
the
corral
which
they
know
to
be
well
stored
and
alone
you
could
not
hold
it
against
them
oh
if
we
were
only
at
granite
house
if
we
were
at
granite
house
answered
the
engineer
the
case
would
be
very
different
there
i
should
not
be
afraid
to
leave
herbert
with
one
while
the
other
three
went
to
search
the
forests
of
the
island
but
we
are
at
the
corral
and
it
is
best
to
stay
here
until
we
can
leave
it
together
cyrus
hardings
reasoning
was
unanswerable
and
his
companions
understood
it
well
if
only
ayrton
was
still
one
of
us
said
gideon
spilett
poor
fellow
his
return
to
social
life
will
have
been
but
of
short
duration
if
he
is
dead
added
pencroft
in
a
peculiar
tone
do
you
hope
then
pencroft
that
the
villains
have
spared
him
asked
gideon
spilett
yes
if
they
had
any
interest
in
doing
so
what
you
suppose
that
ayrton
finding
his
old
companions
forgetting
all
that
he
owes
us
who
knows
answered
the
sailor
who
did
not
hazard
this
shameful
supposition
without
hesitating
pencroft
said
harding
taking
the
sailors
arm
that
is
a
wicked
idea
of
yours
and
you
will
distress
me
much
if
you
persist
in
speaking
thus
i
will
answer
for
ayrtons
fidelity
and
i
also
added
the
reporter
quickly
yes
yes
captain
i
was
wrong
replied
pencroft
it
was
a
wicked
idea
indeed
that
i
had
and
nothing
justifies
it
but
what
can
i
do
im
not
in
my
senses
this
imprisonment
in
the
corral
wearies
me
horribly
and
i
have
never
felt
so
excited
as
i
do
now
be
patient
pencroft
replied
the
engineer
how
long
will
it
be
my
dear
spilett
before
you
think
herbert
may
be
carried
to
granite
house
that
is
difficult
to
say
cyrus
answered
the
reporter
for
any
imprudence
might
involve
terrible
consequences
but
his
convalescence
is
progressing
and
if
he
continues
to
gain
strength
in
eight
days
from
nowwell
we
shall
see
eight
days
that
would
put
off
the
return
to
granite
house
until
the
first
days
of
december
at
this
time
two
months
of
spring
had
already
passed
the
weather
was
fine
and
the
heat
began
to
be
great
the
forests
of
the
island
were
in
full
leaf
and
the
time
was
approaching
when
the
usual
crops
ought
to
be
gathered
the
return
to
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
would
therefore
be
followed
by
extensive
agricultural
labors
interrupted
only
by
the
projected
expedition
through
the
island
it
can
therefore
be
well
understood
how
injurious
this
seclusion
in
the
corral
must
have
been
to
the
colonists
but
if
they
were
compelled
to
bow
before
necessity
they
did
not
do
so
without
impatience
once
or
twice
the
reporter
ventured
out
into
the
road
and
made
the
tour
of
the
palisade
top
accompanied
him
and
gideon
spilett
his
gun
cocked
was
ready
for
any
emergency
he
met
with
no
misadventure
and
found
no
suspicious
traces
his
dog
would
have
warned
him
of
any
danger
and
as
top
did
not
bark
it
might
be
concluded
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
at
the
moment
at
least
and
that
the
convicts
were
occupied
in
another
part
of
the
island
however
on
his
second
sortie
on
the
27th
of
november
gideon
spilett
who
had
ventured
a
quarter
of
a
mile
into
the
woods
towards
the
south
of
the
mountain
remarked
that
top
scented
something
the
dog
had
no
longer
his
unconcerned
manner
he
went
backwards
and
forwards
ferreting
among
the
grass
and
bushes
as
if
his
smell
had
revealed
some
suspicious
object
to
him
gideon
spilett
followed
top
encouraged
him
excited
him
by
his
voice
while
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
his
gun
ready
to
fire
and
sheltering
himself
behind
the
trees
it
was
not
probable
that
top
scented
the
presence
of
man
for
in
that
case
he
would
have
announced
it
by
halfuttered
sullen
angry
barks
now
as
he
did
not
growl
it
was
because
danger
was
neither
near
nor
approaching
nearly
five
minutes
passed
thus
top
rummaging
the
reporter
following
him
prudently
when
all
at
once
the
dog
rushed
towards
a
thick
bush
and
drew
out
a
rag
it
was
a
piece
of
cloth
stained
and
torn
which
spilett
immediately
brought
back
to
the
corral
there
it
was
examined
by
the
colonists
who
found
that
it
was
a
fragment
of
ayrtons
waistcoat
a
piece
of
that
felt
manufactured
solely
by
the
granite
house
factory
you
see
pencroft
observed
harding
there
has
been
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
unfortunate
ayrton
the
convicts
have
dragged
him
away
in
spite
of
himself
do
you
still
doubt
his
honesty
no
captain
answered
the
sailor
and
i
repented
of
my
suspicion
a
long
time
ago
but
it
seems
to
me
that
something
may
be
learned
from
the
incident
what
is
that
asked
the
reporter
it
is
that
ayrton
was
not
killed
at
the
corral
that
they
dragged
him
away
living
since
he
has
resisted
therefore
perhaps
he
is
still
living
perhaps
indeed
replied
the
engineer
who
remained
thoughtful
this
was
a
hope
to
which
ayrtons
companions
could
still
hold
indeed
they
had
before
believed
that
surprised
in
the
corral
ayrton
had
fallen
by
a
bullet
as
herbert
had
fallen
but
if
the
convicts
had
not
killed
him
at
first
if
they
had
brought
him
living
to
another
part
of
the
island
might
it
not
be
admitted
that
he
was
still
their
prisoner
perhaps
even
one
of
them
had
found
in
ayrton
his
old
australian
companion
ben
joyce
the
chief
of
the
escaped
convicts
and
who
knows
but
that
they
had
conceived
the
impossible
hope
of
bringing
back
ayrton
to
themselves
he
would
have
been
very
useful
to
them
if
they
had
been
able
to
make
him
turn
traitor
this
incident
was
therefore
favorably
interpreted
at
the
corral
and
it
no
longer
appeared
impossible
that
they
should
find
ayrton
again
on
his
side
if
he
was
only
a
prisoner
ayrton
would
no
doubt
do
all
he
could
to
escape
from
the
hands
of
the
villains
and
this
would
be
a
powerful
aid
to
the
settlers
at
any
rate
observed
gideon
spilett
if
happily
ayrton
did
manage
to
escape
he
would
go
directly
to
granite
house
for
he
could
not
know
of
the
attempted
assassination
of
which
herbert
has
been
a
victim
and
consequently
would
never
think
of
our
being
imprisoned
in
the
corral
oh
i
wish
that
he
was
there
at
granite
house
cried
pencroft
and
that
we
were
there
too
for
although
the
rascals
can
do
nothing
to
our
house
they
may
plunder
the
plateau
our
plantations
our
poultryyard
pencroft
had
become
a
thorough
farmer
heartily
attached
to
his
crops
but
it
must
be
said
that
herbert
was
more
anxious
than
any
to
return
to
granite
house
for
he
knew
how
much
the
presence
of
the
settlers
was
needed
there
and
it
was
he
who
was
keeping
them
at
the
corral
therefore
one
idea
occupied
his
mindto
leave
the
corral
and
when
he
believed
he
could
bear
removal
to
granite
house
he
was
sure
his
strength
would
return
more
quickly
in
his
room
with
the
air
and
sight
of
the
sea
several
times
he
pressed
gideon
spilett
but
the
latter
fearing
with
good
reason
that
herberts
wounds
half
healed
might
reopen
on
the
way
did
not
give
the
order
to
start
however
something
occurred
which
compelled
cyrus
harding
and
his
two
friends
to
yield
to
the
lads
wish
and
god
alone
knew
that
this
determination
might
cause
them
grief
and
remorse
it
was
the
29th
of
november
seven
oclock
in
the
evening
the
three
settlers
were
talking
in
herberts
room
when
they
heard
top
utter
quick
barks
harding
pencroft
and
spilett
seized
their
guns
and
ran
out
of
the
house
top
at
the
foot
of
the
palisade
was
jumping
barking
but
it
was
with
pleasure
not
anger
some
one

these
words
had
hardly
been
exchanged
between
the
engineer
and
his
two
companions
when
a
body
leaped
over
the
palisade
and
fell
on
the
ground
inside
the
corral
it
was
jup
master
jup
in
person
to
whom
top
immediately
gave
a
most
cordial
reception
jup
exclaimed
pencroft
neb
has
sent
him
to
us
said
the
reporter
then
replied
the
engineer
he
must
have
some
note
on
him
pencroft
rushed
up
to
the
orang
certainly
if
neb
had
any
important
matter
to
communicate
to
his
master
he
could
not
employ
a
more
sure
or
more
rapid
messenger
who
could
pass
where
neither
the
colonists
could
nor
even
top
himself
cyrus
harding
was
not
mistaken
at
jups
neck
hung
a
small
bag
and
in
this
bag
was
found
a
little
note
traced
by
nebs
hand
the
despair
of
harding
and
his
companions
may
be
imagined
when
they
read

words

plateau
invaded
by
convicts
neb
they
gazed
at
each
other
without
uttering
a
word
then
they
reentered
the
house
what
were
they
to
do
the

on

that
was

herbert
on
seeing
the
engineer
the
reporter
and
pencroft
reenter
guessed
that
their
situation
was
aggravated
and
when
he
saw
jup
he
no
longer
doubted
that
some
misfortune
menaced
granite
house
captain
harding
said
he
i
must
go
i
can
bear
the
journey
i
must
go
gideon
spilett
approached
herbert
then
having
looked
at
him
let
us
go
then
said
he
the
question
was
quickly
decided
whether
herbert
should
be
carried
on
a
litter
or
in
the
cart
which
had
brought
ayrton
to
the
corral
the
motion
of
the
litter
would
have
been
more
easy
for
the
wounded
lad
but
it
would
have
necessitated
two
bearers
that
is
to
say
there
would
have
been
two
guns
less
for
defense
if
an
attack
was
made
on
the
road
would
they
not
on
the
contrary
by
employing
the
cart
leave
every
arm
free
was
it
impossible
to
place
the
mattress
on
which
herbert
was
lying
in
it
and
to
advance
with
so
much
care
that
any
jolt
should
be
avoided
it
could
be
done
the
cart
was
brought
pencroft
harnessed
the
onager
cyrus
harding
and
the
reporter
raised
herberts
mattress
and
placed
it
on
the
bottom
of
the
cart
the
weather
was
fine
the
suns
bright
rays
glanced
through
the
trees
are
the
guns
ready
asked
cyrus
harding
they
were
the
engineer
and
pencroft
each
armed
with
a
doublebarreled
gun
and
gideon
spilett
carrying
his
rifle
had
nothing
to
do
but
start
are
you
comfortable
herbert
asked
the
engineer
ah
captain
replied
the
lad
dont
be
uneasy
i
shall
not
die
on
the
road
while
speaking
thus
it
could
be
seen
that
the
poor
boy
had
called
up
all
his
energy
and
by
the
energy
of
a
powerful
will
had
collected
his
failing
strength
the
engineer
felt
his
heart
sink
painfully
he
still
hesitated
to
give
the
signal
for
departure
but
that
would
have
driven
herbert
to
despairkilled
him
perhaps
forward
said
harding
the
gate
of
the
corral
was
opened
jup
and
top
who
knew
when
to
be
silent
ran
in
advance
the
cart
came
out
the
gate
was
reclosed
and
the
onager
led
by
pencroft
advanced
at
a
slow
pace
certainly
it
would
have
been
safer
to
have
taken
a
different
road
than
that
which
led
straight
from
the
corral
to
granite
house
but
the
cart
would
have
met
with
great
difficulties
in
moving
under
the
trees
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
follow
this
way
although
it
was
well
known
to
the
convicts
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
walked
one
on
each
side
of
the
cart
ready
to
answer
to
any
attack
however
it
was
not
probable
that
the
convicts
would
have
yet
left
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
nebs
note
had
evidently
been
written
and
sent
as
soon
as
the
convicts
had
shown
themselves
there
now
this
note
was
dated
six
oclock
in
the
morning
and
the
active
orang
accustomed
to
come
frequently
to
the
corral
had
taken
scarcely
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
cross
the
five
miles
which
separated
it
from
granite
house
they
would
therefore
be
safe
at
that
time
and
if
there
was
any
occasion
for
firing
it
would
probably
not
be
until
they
were
in
the
neighborhood
of
granite
house
however
the
colonists
kept
a
strict
watch
top
and
jup
the
latter
armed
with
his
club
sometimes
in
front
sometimes
beating
the
wood
at
the
sides
of
the
road
signalized
no
danger
the
cart
advanced
slowly
under
pencrofts
guidance
it
had
left
the
corral
at
halfpast
seven
an
hour
after
four
out
of
the
five
miles
had
been
cleared
without
any
incident
having
occurred
the
road
was
as
deserted
as
all
that
part
of
the
jacamar
wood
which
lay
between
the
mercy
and
the
lake
there
was
no
occasion
for
any
warning
the
wood
appeared
as
deserted
as
on
the
day
when
the
colonists
first
landed
on
the
island
they
approached
the
plateau
another
mile
and
they
would
see
the
bridge
over
creek
glycerine
cyrus
harding
expected
to
find
it
in
its
place
supposing
that
the
convicts
would
have
crossed
it
and
that
after
having
passed
one
of
the
streams
which
enclosed
the
plateau
they
would
have
taken
the
precaution
to
lower
it
again
so
as
to
keep
open
a
retreat
at
length
an
opening
in
the
trees
allowed
the
seahorizon
to
be
seen
but
the
cart
continued
its
progress
for
not
one
of
its
defenders
thought
of
abandoning
it
at
that
moment
pencroft
stopped
the
onager
and
in
a
hoarse
voice
oh
the
villains
he
exclaimed
and
he
pointed
to
a
thick
smoke
rising
from
the
mill
the
sheds
and
the
buildings
at
the
poultryyard
a
man
was
moving
about
in
the
midst
of
the
smoke
it
was
neb
his
companions
uttered
a
shout
he
heard
and
ran
to
meet
them
the
convicts
had
left
the
plateau
nearly
halfanhour
before
having
devastated
it
and
mr
herbert
asked
neb
gideon
spilett
returned
to
the

herbert
had
lost
consciousness
chapter

of
the
convicts
the
dangers
which
menaced
granite
house
the
ruins
with
which
the
plateau
was
covered
the
colonists
thought
no
longer
herberts
critical
state
outweighed
all
other
considerations
would
the
removal
prove
fatal
to
him
by
causing
some
internal
injury
the
reporter
could
not
affirm
it
but
he
and
his
companions
almost
despaired
of
the
result
the
cart
was
brought
to
the
bend
of
the
river
there
some
branches
disposed
as
a
liner
received
the
mattress
on
which
lay
the
unconscious
herbert
ten
minutes
after
cyrus
harding
spilett
and
pencroft
were
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
leaving
neb
to
take
the
cart
on
to
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
the
lift
was
put
in
motion
and
herbert
was
soon
stretched
on
his
bed
in
granite
house
what
cares
were
lavished
on
him
to
bring
him
back
to
life
he
smiled
for
a
moment
on
finding
himself
in
his
room
but
could
scarcely
even
murmur
a
few
words
so
great
was
his
weakness
gideon
spilett
examined
his
wounds
he
feared
to
find
them
reopened
having
been
imperfectly
healed
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
from
whence
then
came
this
prostration
why
was
herbert
so
much
worse
the
lad
then
fell
into
a
kind
of
feverish
sleep
and
the
reporter
and
pencroft
remained
near
the
bed
during
this
time
harding
told
neb
all
that
had
happened
at
the
corral
and
neb
recounted
to
his
master
the
events
of
which
the
plateau
had
just
been
the
theater
it
was
only
during
the
preceding
night
that
the
convicts
had
appeared
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
at
the
approaches
to
creek
glycerine
neb
who
was
watching
near
the
poultryyard
had
not
hesitated
to
fire
at
one
of
the
pirates
who
was
about
to
cross
the
stream
but
in
the
darkness
he
could
not
tell
whether
the
man
had
been
hit
or
not
at
any
rate
it
was
not
enough
to
frighten
away
the
band
and
neb
had
only
just
time
to
get
up
to
granite
house
where
at
least
he
was
in
safety
but
what
was
he
to
do
there
how
prevent
the
devastations
with
which
the
convicts
threatened
the
plateau
had
neb
any
means
by
which
to
warn
his

in
what
situation
were
the

left
on
the
11th
of
november
and
it
was
now
the
29th
it
was

to

asked
poor

personally
he
had
nothing
to
fear
for
the

but
the
buildings
the
plantations
all
their
arrangements
at
the

of
the

would
it
not
be
best
to
let
cyrus
harding
judge
of
what
he
ought
to
do
and
to
warn
him
at
least
of
the
danger
which
threatened
him
neb
then
thought
of
employing
jup
and
confiding
a
note
to
him
he
knew
the
orangs
great
intelligence
which
had
been
often
put
to
the
proof
jup
understood
the
word
corral
which
had
been
frequently
pronounced
before
him
and
it
may
be
remembered
too
that
he
had
often
driven
the
cart
thither
in
company
with
pencroft
day
had
not
yet
dawned
the
active
orang
would
know
how
to
pass
unperceived
through
the
woods
of
which
the
convicts
besides
would
think
he
was
a
native
neb
did
not
hesitate
he
wrote
the
note
he
tied
it
to
jups
neck
he
brought
the
ape
to
the
door
of
granite
house
from
which
he
let
down
a
long
cord
to

several
times
he
repeated

words

the

rapidly
down
the

and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
without

attention
having
been
in
the
least
excited
you
did
well
neb
said
harding
but
perhaps
in
not
warning
us
you
would
have
done
still
better
and
in
speaking
thus
cyrus
harding
thought
of
herbert
whose
recovery
the

had
so
seriously
checked
neb
ended
his
account
the

not
appeared
at
all
on
the

not
knowing
the
number
of
the
islands
inhabitants
they
might
suppose
that
granite
house
was
defended
by
a
large
party
they
must
have
remembered
that
during
the
attack
by
the
brig
numerous
shot
had
been
fired
both
from
the
lower
and
upper
rocks
and
no
doubt
they
did
not
wish
to
expose
themselves
but
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
was
open
to
them
and
not
covered
by
the
fire
of
granite
house
they
gave
themselves
up
therefore
to
their
instinct
of
destructionplundering
burning
devastating
everythingand
only
retiring
half
an
hour
before
the

of

they
believed
still
confined
in
the

on
their
retreat

fired
at
tried
to
extinguish
the
fire
which
was
consuming
the
buildings
of
the

struggled
though
in
vain
against
it
until
the

appeared
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
such
had
been
these
serious
events
the

so
happy
and
who
might

spilett
remained
in

house
with
herbert
and
pencroft
while
cyrus
harding
accompanied
by
neb
proceeded
to
judge
for
himself
of
the
extent
of
the
disaster
it
was
fortunate
that
the
convicts
had
not
advanced
to
the
foot
of

house
the
workshop
at
the
chimneys
would
in
that
case
not
have
escaped
destruction
but
after
all
this
evil
would
have
been
more
easily
reparable
than
the

on

of
the
convicts
nor
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
the
depths
of
the
wood
could
they
perceive
any
suspicious
indications
besides
it
might
be
supposed
that
in
all
probability
either
the
convicts
knew
of
the
return
of
the
settlers
to
granite
house
by
having
seen
them
pass
on
the
road
from
the
corral
or
after
the
devastation
of
the
plateau
they
had
penetrated
into
jacamar
wood
following
the
course
of
the
mercy
and
were
thus
ignorant
of
their
return
in
the
former
case
they
must
have
returned
towards
the
corral
now
without
defenders
and
which
contained
valuable
stores
in
the
latter
they
must
have
regained
their
encampment
and
would
wait
on
opportunity
to
recommence
the
attack
it
was
therefore
possible
to
prevent
them
but
any
enterprise
to
clear
the
island
was
now
rendered
difficult
by
reason
of
herberts
condition
indeed
their
whole
force
would
have
been
barely
sufficient
to
cope
with
the
convicts
and
just
now
no
one
could
leave
granite
house
the
engineer
and
neb
arrived
on
the
plateau
desolation
reigned
everywhere
the
fields
had
been
trampled
over
the
ears
of
wheat
which
were
nearly
fullgrown
lay
on
the
ground
the
other
plantations
had
not
suffered
less
the
kitchengarden
was
destroyed
happily
granite
house
possessed
a
store
of
seed
which
would
enable
them
to
repair
these
misfortunes
as
to
the
wall
and
buildings
of
the
poultryyard
and
the
onagers
stable
the
fire
had
destroyed
all
a
few
terrified
creatures
roamed
over
the
plateau
the
birds
which
during
the
fire
had
taken
refuge
on
the
waters
of
the
lake
had
already
returned
to
their
accustomed
spot
and
were
dabbling
on
the
banks
everything
would
have
to
be
reconstructed
cyrus
hardings
face
which
was
paler
than
usual
expressed
an
internal
anger
which
he
commanded
with
difficulty
but
he
did
not
utter
a
word
once
more
he
looked
at
his
devastated
fields
and
at
the
smoke
which
still
rose
from
the
ruins
then
he
returned
to
granite
house
the
following
days
were
the
saddest
of
any
that
the
colonists
had
passed
on
the
island
herberts
weakness
visibly
increased
it
appeared
that
a
more
serious
malady
the
consequence
of
the
profound
physiological
disturbance
he
had
gone
through
threatened
to
declare
itself
and
gideon
spilett
feared
such
an
aggravation
of
his
condition
that
he
would
be
powerless
to
fight
against
it
in
fact
herbert
remained
in
an
almost
continuous
state
of
drowsiness
and
symptoms
of
delirium
began
to
manifest
themselves
refreshing
drinks
were
the
only
remedies
at
the
colonists
disposal
the
fever
was
not
as
yet
very
high
but
it
soon
appeared
that
it
would
probably
recur
at
regular
intervals
gideon
spilett
first
recognized
this
on
the
6th
of
december
the
poor
boy
whose
fingers
nose
and
ears
had
become
extremely
pale
was
at
first
seized
with
slight
shiverings
horripilations
and
tremblings
his
pulse
was
weak
and
irregular
his
skin
dry
his
thirst
intense
to
this
soon
succeeded
a
hot
fit
his
face
became
flushed
his
skin
reddened
his
pulse
quick
then
a
profuse
perspiration
broke
out
after
which
the
fever
seemed
to
diminish
the
attack
had
lasted
nearly
five
hours
gideon
spilett
had
not
left
herbert
who
it
was
only
too
certain
was
now
seized
by
an
intermittent
fever
and
this
fever
must
be
cured
at
any
cost
before
it
should
assume
a
more
serious
aspect
and
in
order
to
cure
it
said
spilett
to
cyrus
harding
we
need
a
febrifuge
a
febrifuge
answered
the
engineer
we
have
neither
peruvian
bark
nor
sulphate
of
quinine
no
said
gideon
spilett
but
there
are
willows
on
the
border
of
the
lake
and
the
bark
of
the
willow
might
perhaps
prove
to
be
a
substitute
for
quinine
let
us
try
it
without
losing
a
moment
replied
cyrus
harding
the
bark
of
the
willow
has
indeed
been
justly
considered
as
a
succedaneum
for
peruvian
bark
as
has
also
that
of
the
horsechestnut
tree
the
leaf
of
the
holly
the
snakeroot
etc
it
was
evidently
necessary
to
make
trial
of
this
substance
although
not
so
valuable
as
peruvian
bark
and
to
employ
it
in
its
natural
state
since
they
had
no
means
for
extracting
its
essence
cyrus
harding
went
himself
to
cut
from
the
trunk
of
a
species
of
black
willow
a
few
pieces
of
bark
he
brought
them
back
to
granite
house
and
reduced
them
to
a
powder
which
was
administered
that
same
evening
to
herbert
the
night
passed
without
any
important
change
herbert
was
somewhat
delirious
but
the
fever
did
not
reappear
in
the
night
and
did
not
return
either
during
the
following
day
pencroft
again
began
to
hope
gideon
spilett
said
nothing
it
might
be
that
the
fever
was
not
quotidian
but
tertian
and
that
it
would
return
next
day
therefore
he
awaited
the
next
day
with
the
greatest
anxiety
it
might
have
been
remarked
besides
that
during
this
period
herbert
remained
utterly
prostrate
his
head
weak
and
giddy
another
symptom
alarmed
the
reporter
to
the
highest
degree
herberts
liver
became
congested
and
soon
a
more
intense
delirium
showed
that
his
brain
was
also
affected
gideon
spilett
was
overwhelmed
by
this
new
complication
he
took
the
engineer
aside
it
is
a
malignant
fever
said
he
a
malignant
fever
cried
harding
you
are
mistaken
spilett
a
malignant
fever
does
not
declare
itself
spontaneously
its
germ
must
previously
have
existed
i
am
not
mistaken
replied
the
reporter
herbert
no
doubt
contracted
the
germ
of
this
fever
in
the
marshes
of
the
island
he
has
already
had
one
attack
should
a
second
come
on
and
should
we
not
be
able
to
prevent
a
third
he
is
lost
but
the
willow
bark
that
is
insufficient
answered
the
reporter
and
the
third
attack
of
a
malignant
fever
which
is
not
arrested
by
means
of
quinine
is
always
fatal
fortunately
pencroft
heard
nothing
of
this
conversation
or
he
would
have
gone
mad
it
may
be
imagined
what
anxiety
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
suffered
during
the
day
of
the
7th
of
december
and
the
following
night
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
the
second
attack
came
on
the
crisis
was
terrible
herbert
felt
himself
sinking
he
stretched
his
arms
towards
cyrus
harding
towards
spilett
towards
pencroft
he
was
so
young
to
die
the
scene
was
heartrending
they
were
obliged
to
send
pencroft
away
the
fit
lasted
five
hours
it
was
evident
that
herbert
could
not
survive
a
third
the
night
was
frightful
in
his
delirium
herbert
uttered
words
which
went
to
the
hearts
of
his
companions
he
struggled
with
the
convicts
he
called
to
ayrton
he
poured
forth
entreaties
to
that
mysterious
beingthat
powerful
unknown
protectorwhose
image
was
stamped
upon
his
mind
then
he
again
fell
into
a
deep
exhaustion
which
completely
prostrated
him
several
times
gideon
spilett
thought
that
the
poor
boy
was
dead
the
next
day
the
8th
of
december
was
but
a
succession
of
the
fainting
fits
herberts
thin
hands
clutched
the
sheets
they
had
administered
further
doses
of
pounded
bark
but
the
reporter
expected
no
result
from
it
if
before
tomorrow
morning
we
have
not
given
him
a
more
energetic
febrifuge
said
the
reporter
herbert
will
be
dead
night
arrivedthe
last
night
it
was
too
much
to
be
feared
of
the
good
brave
intelligent
boy
so
far
in
advance
of
his
years
and
who
was
loved
by
all
as
their
own
child
the
only
remedy
which
existed
against
this
terrible
malignant
fever
the
only
specific
which
could
overcome
it
was
not
to
be
found
in
lincoln
island
during
the
night
of
the
8th
of
december
herbert
was
seized
by
a
more
violent
delirium
his
liver
was
fearfully
congested
his
brain
affected
and
already
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
recognize
any
one
would
he
live
until
the
next
day
until
that
third
attack
which
must
infallibly
carry
him
off
it
was
not
probable
his
strength
was
exhausted
and
in
the
intervals
of
fever
he
lay
as
one
dead
towards
three
oclock
in
the
morning
herbert
uttered
a
piercing
cry
he
seemed
to
be
torn
by
a
supreme
convulsion
neb
who
was
near
him
terrified
ran
into
the
next
room
where
his
companions
were
watching
top
at
that
moment
barked
in
a
strange
manner
all
rushed
in
immediately
and
managed
to
restrain
the
dying
boy
who
was
endeavoring
to
throw
himself
out
of
his
bed
while
spilett
taking
his
arm
felt
his
pulse
gradually
quicken
it
was
five
in
the
morning
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
began
to
shine
in
at
the
windows
of
granite
house
it
promised
to
be
a
fine
day
and
this
day
was
to
be
poor
herberts
last
a
ray
glanced
on
the
table
placed
near
the
bed
suddenly
pencroft
uttering
a
cry
pointed
to
the
table
on
it
lay
a
little
oblong
box
of
which
the
cover
bore
these
wordssulphate
of
quinine
chapter
11
gideon
spilett
took
the
box
and
opened
it
it
contained
nearly
two
hundred
grains
of
a
white
powder
a
few
particles
of
which
he
carried
to
his
lips
the
extreme
bitterness
of
the
substance
precluded
all
doubt
it
was
certainly
the
precious
extract
of
quinine
that
preeminent
antifebrile
this
powder
must
be
administered
to
herbert
without
delay
how
it
came
there
might
be
discussed
later
some
coffee
said
spilett
in
a
few
moments
neb
brought
a
cup
of
the
warm
infusion
gideon
spilett
threw
into
it
about
eighteen
grains
of
quinine
and
they
succeeded
in
making
herbert
drink
the
mixture
there
was
still
time
for
the
third
attack
of
the
malignant
fever
had
not
yet
shown
itself
how
they
longed
to
be
able
to
add
that
it
would
not
return
besides
it
must
be
remarked
the
hopes
of
all
had
now
revived
the
mysterious
influence
had
been
again
exerted
and
in
a
critical
moment
when
they
had
despaired
of
it
in
a
few
hours
herbert
was
much
calmer
the
colonists
could
now
discuss
this
incident
the
intervention
of
the
stranger
was
more
evident
than
ever
but
how
had
he
been
able
to
penetrate
during
the
night
into
granite
house
it
was
inexplicable
and
in
truth
the
proceedings
of
the
genius
of
the
island
were
not
less
mysterious
than
was
that
genius
himself
during
this
day
the
sulphate
of
quinine
was
administered
to
herbert
every
three
hours
the
next
day
some
improvement
in
herberts
condition
was
apparent
certainly
he
was
not
out
of
danger
intermittent
fevers
being
subject
to
frequent
and
dangerous
relapses
but
the
most
assiduous
care
was
bestowed
on
him
and
besides
the
specific
was
at
hand
nor
doubtless
was
he
who
had
brought
it
far
distant
and
the
hearts
of
all
were
animated
by
returning
hope
this
hope
was
not
disappointed
ten
days
after
on
the
20th
of
december
herberts
convalescence
commenced
he
was
still
weak
and
strict
diet
had
been
imposed
upon
him
but
no
access
of
fever
supervened
and
then
the
poor
boy
submitted
with
such
docility
to
all
the
prescriptions
ordered
him
he
longed
so
to
get
well
pencroft
was
as
a
man
who
has
been
drawn
up
from
the
bottom
of
an
abyss
fits
of
joy
approaching
delirium
seized
him
when
the
time
for
the
third
attack
had
passed
by
he
nearly
suffocated
the
reporter
in
his
embrace
since
then
he
always
called
him
dr
spilett
the
real
doctor
however
remained
undiscovered
we
will
find
him
repeated
the
sailor
certainly
this
man
whoever
he
was
might
expect
a
somewhat
too
energetic
embrace
from
the
worthy
pencroft
the
month
of
december
ended
and
with
it
the
year
1867
during
which
the
colonists
of
lincoln
island
had
of
late
been
so
severely
tried
they
commenced
the
year
1868
with
magnificent
weather
great
heat
and
a
tropical
temperature
delightfully
cooled
by
the
seabreeze
herberts
recovery
progressed
and
from
his
bed
placed
near
one
of
the
windows
of
granite
house
he
could
inhale
the
fresh
air
charged
with
ozone
which
could
not
fail
to
restore
his
health
his
appetite
returned
and
what
numberless
delicate
savory
little
dishes
neb
prepared
for
him
it
is
enough
to
make
one
wish
to
have
a
fever

pencroft
during
all
this
time
the
convicts
did
not
once
appear
in
the
vicinity
of
granite
house
there
was
no
news
of
ayrton
and
though
the
engineer
and
herbert
still
had
some
hopes
of
finding
him
again
their
companions
did
not
doubt
but
that
the
unfortunate
man
had
perished
however
this
uncertainty
could
not
last
and
when
once
the
lad
should
have
recovered
the
expedition
the
result
of
which
must
be
so
important
would
be
undertaken
but
they
would
have
to
wait
a
month
perhaps
for
all
the
strength
of
the
colony
must
be
put
into
requisition
to
obtain
satisfaction
from
the
convicts
however
herberts
convalescence
progressed
rapidly
the
congestion
of
the
liver
had
disappeared
and
his
wounds
might
be
considered
completely
healed
during
the
month
of
january
important
work
was
done
on
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
but
it
consisted
solely
in
saving
as
much
as
was
possible
from
the
devastated
crops
either
of
corn
or
vegetables
the
grain
and
the
plants
were
gathered
so
as
to
provide
a
new
harvest
for
the
approaching
halfseason
with
regard
to
rebuilding
the
poultryyard
wall
or
stables
cyrus
harding
preferred
to
wait
while
he
and
his
companions
were
in
pursuit
of
the
convicts
the
latter
might
very
probably
pay
another
visit
to
the
plateau
and
it
would
be
useless
to
give
them
an
opportunity
of
recommencing
their
work
of
destruction
when
the
island
should
be
cleared
of
these
miscreants
they
would
set
about

his
strength
visibly
returned
so
vigorous
was
his
constitution
he
was
now
eighteen
years
of
age
he
was
tall
and
promised
to
become
a
man
of
noble
and
commanding
presence

towards
the

of

herbert
was
already
walking
about
on

and
the

he
derived
from
several
seabaths
which
he
took
in
company
with
pencroft
and

the
greatest
possible
benefit
cyrus
harding
thought
he
might
now
settle
the
day
for
their
departure
for
which
the
15th
of
february
was
fixed
the
nights
very
clear
at
this
time
of
year
would
be
favorable
to
the
researches
they
intended
to
make
all
over
the
island
the
necessary
preparations
for
this
exploration
were
now
commenced
and
were
important
for
the
colonists
had
sworn
not
to
return
to
granite
house
until
their
twofold
object
had
been
achieved
on
the
one
hand
to
exterminate
the
convicts
and
rescue
ayrton
if
he
was
still
living
on
the
other
to
discover
who
it
was
that
presided
so
effectually
over
the
fortunes
of
the
colony
of
lincoln
island
the
settlers
knew
thoroughly
all
the
eastern
coast
from
claw
cape
to
the
mandible
capes
the
extensive
tadorn
marsh
the
neighborhood
of
lake
grant
jacamar
wood
between
the
road
to
the
corral
and
the
mercy
the
courses
of
the
mercy
and
red
creek
and
lastly
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
among
which
the
corral
had
been
established
they
had
explored
though
only
in
an
imperfect
manner
the
vast
shore
of
washington
bay
from
claw
cape
to
reptile
end
the
woody
and
marshy
border
of
the
west
coast
and
the
interminable
downs
ending
at
the
open
mouth
of
shark
gulf
but
they
had
in
no
way
surveyed
the
woods
which
covered
the
serpentine
peninsula
all
to
the
right
of
the
mercy
the
left
bank
of
falls
river
and
the
wilderness
of
spurs
and
valleys
which
supported
three
quarters
of
the
base
of
mount
franklin
to
the
east
the
north
and
the
west
and
where
doubtless
many
secret
retreats
existed
consequently
many
millions
of
acres
of
the
island
had
still
escaped
their
investigations
it
was
therefore
decided
that
the
expedition
should
be
carried
through
the
far
west
so
as
to
include
all
that
region
situated
on
the
right
of
the
mercy
it
might
perhaps
be
better
worth
while
to
go
direct
to
the
corral
where
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
convicts
had
again
taken
refuge
either
to
pillage
or
to
establish
themselves
there
but
either
the
devastation
of
the
corral
would
have
been
an
accomplished
fact
by
this
time
and
it
would
be
too
late
to
prevent
it
or
it
had
been
the
convicts
interest
to
entrench
themselves
there
and
there
would
be
still
time
to
go
and
turn
them
out
on
their
return
therefore
after
some
discussion
the
first
plan
was
adhered
to
and
the
settlers
resolved
to
proceed
through
the
wood
to
reptile
end
they
would
make
their
way
with
their
hatchets
and
thus
lay
the
first
draft
of
a
road
which
would
place
granite
house
in
communication
with
the
end
of
the
peninsula
for
a
length
of
from
sixteen
to
seventeen
miles
the
cart
was
in
good
condition
the
onagers
well
rested
could
go
a
long
journey
provisions
camp
effects
a
portable
stove
and
various
utensils
were
packed
in
the
cart
as
also
weapons
and
ammunition
carefully
chosen
from
the
now
complete
arsenal
of
granite
house
but
it
was
necessary
to
remember
that
the
convicts
were
perhaps
roaming
about
the
woods
and
that
in
the
midst
of
these
thick
forests
a
shot
might
quickly
be
fired
and
received
it
was
therefore
resolved
that
the
little
band
of
settlers
should
remain
together
and
not
separate
under
any
pretext
whatever
it
was
also
decided
that
no
one
should
remain
at
granite
house
top
and
jup
themselves
were
to
accompany
the
expedition
the
inaccessible
dwelling
needed
no
guard
the
14th
of
february
eve
of
the
departure
was
consecrated
entirely
to
repose
andthanksgiving
addressed
by
the
colonists
to
the
creator
a
place
in
the
cart
was
reserved
for
herbert
who
though
thoroughly
convalescent
was
still
a
little
weak
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
cyrus
harding
took
the
necessary
measures
to
protect
granite
house
from
any
invasion
the
ladders
which
were
formerly
used
for
the
ascent
were
brought
to
the
chimneys
and
buried
deep
in
the
sand
so
that
they
might
be
available
on
the
return
of
the
colonists
for
the
machinery
of
the
lift
had
been
taken
to
pieces
and
nothing
of
the
apparatus
remained
pencroft
stayed
the
last
in
granite
house
in
order
to
finish
this
work
and
he
then
lowered
himself
down
by
means
of
a
double
rope
held
below
and
which
when
once
hauled
down
left
no
communication
between
the
upper
landing
and
the
beach
the
weather
was
magnificent
we
shall
have
a
warm
day
of
it
said
the
reporter
laughing
pooh
dr
spilett
answered
pencroft
we
shall
walk
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
shant
even
see
the
sun
forward
said
the
engineer
the
cart
was
waiting
on
the
beach
before
the
chimneys
the
reporter
made
herbert
take
his
place
in
it
during
the
first
hours
at
least
of
the
journey
and
the
lad
was
obliged
to
submit
to
his
doctors
orders
neb
placed
himself
at
the
onagers
heads
cyrus
harding
the
reporter
and
the
sailor
walked
in
front
top
bounded
joyfully
along
herbert
offered
a
seat
in
his
vehicle
to
jup
who
accepted
it
without
ceremony
the
moment
for
departure
had
arrived
and
the
little
band
set
out
the
cart
first
turned
the
angle
of
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
then
having
ascended
the
left
bank
for
a
mile
crossed
the
bridge
at
the
other
side
of
which
commenced
the
road
to
port
balloon
and
there
the
explorers
leaving
this
road
on
their
left
entered
the
cover
of
the
immense
woods
which
formed
the
region
of
the
far
west
for
the
first
two
miles
the
widely
scattered
trees
allowed
the
cart
to
pass
with
ease
from
time
to
time
it
became
necessary
to
cut
away
a
few
creepers
and
bushes
but
no
serious
obstacle
impeded
the
progress
of
the
colonists
the
thick
foliage
of
the
trees
threw
a
grateful
shade
on
the
ground
deodars
douglas
firs
casuarinas
banksias
gumtrees
dragontrees
and
other
wellknown
species
succeeded
each
other
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
feathered
tribes
of
the
island
were
all
representedgrouse
jacamars
pheasants
lories
as
well
as
the
chattering
cockatoos
parrots
and
paroquets
agouties
kangaroos
and
capybaras
fled
swiftly
at
their
approach
and
all
this
reminded
the
settlers
of
the
first
excursions
they
had
made
on
their
arrival
at
the
island
nevertheless
observed
cyrus
harding
i
notice
that
these
creatures
both
birds
and
quadrupeds
are
more
timid
than
formerly
these
woods
have
therefore
been
recently
traversed
by
the
convicts
and
we
shall
certainly
find
some
traces
of
them
and
in
fact
in
several
places
they
could
distinguish
traces
more
or
less
recent
of
the
passage
of
a
band
of
menhere
branches
broken
off
the
trees
perhaps
to
mark
out
the
way
there
the
ashes
of
a
fire
and
footprints
in
clayey
spots
but
nothing
which
appeared
to
belong
to
a
settled
encampment
the
engineer
had
recommended
his
companions
to
refrain
from
hunting
the
reports
of
the
firearms
might
give
the
alarm
to
the
convicts
who
were
perhaps
roaming
through
the
forest
moreover
the
hunters
would
necessarily
ramble
some
distance
from
the
cart
which
it
was
dangerous
to
leave
unguarded
in
the
afterpart
of
the
day
when
about
six
miles
from
granite
house
their
progress
became
much
more
difficult
in
order
to
make
their
way
through
some
thickets
they
were
obliged
to
cut
down
trees
before
entering
such
places
harding
was
careful
to
send
in
top
and
jup
who
faithfully
accomplished
their
commission
and
when
the
dog
and
orang
returned
without
giving
any
warning
there
was
evidently
nothing
to
fear
either
from
convicts
or
wild
beasts
two
varieties
of
the
animal
kingdom
whose
ferocious
instincts
placed
them
on
the
same
level
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
the
colonists
encamped
about
nine
miles
from
granite
house
on
the
border
of
a
little
stream
falling
into
the
mercy
and
of
the
existence
of
which
they
had
till
then
been
ignorant
it
evidently
however
belonged
to
the
hydiographical
system
to
which
the
soil
owed
its
astonishing
fertility
the
settlers
made
a
hearty
meal
for
their
appetites
were
sharpened
and
measures
were
then
taken
that
the
night
might
be
passed
in
safety
if
the
engineer
had
had
only
to
deal
with
wild
beasts
jaguars
or
others
he
would
have
simply
lighted
fires
all
around
his
camp
which
would
have
sufficed
for
its
defense
but
the
convicts
would
be
rather
attracted
than
terrified
by
the
flames
and
it
was
therefore
better
to
be
surrounded
by
the
profound
darkness
of
night
the
watch
was
however
carefully
organized
two
of
the
settlers
were
to
watch
together
and
every
two
hours
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
be
relieved
by
their
comrades
and
so
notwithstanding
his
wish
to
the
contrary
herbert
was
exempted
from
guard
pencroft
and
gideon
spilett
in
one
party
the
engineer
and
neb
in
another
mounted
guard
in
turns
over
the
camp
the
night
however
was
but
of
few
hours
the
darkness
was
due
rather
to
the
thickness
of
the
foliage
than
to
the
disappearance
of
the
sun
the
silence
was
scarcely
disturbed
by
the
howling
of
jaguars
and
the
chattering
of
the
monkeys
the
latter
appearing
to
particularly
irritate
master
jup
the
night
passed
without
incident
and
on
the
next
day
the
15th
of
february
the
journey
through
the
forest
tedious
rather
than
difficult
was
continued
this
day
they
could
not
accomplish
more
than
six
miles
for
every
moment
they
were
obliged
to
cut
a
road
with
their
hatchets
like
true
settlers
the
colonists
spared
the
largest
and
most
beautiful
trees
which
would
besides
have
cost
immense
labor
to
fell
and
the
small
ones
only
were
sacrificed
but
the
result
was
that
the
road
took
a
very
winding
direction
and
lengthened
itself
by
numerous
detours
during
the
day
herbert
discovered
several
new
specimens
not
before
met
with
in
the
island
such
as
the
treefern
with
its
leaves
spread
out
like
the
waters
of
a
fountain
locusttrees
on
the
long
pods
of
which
the
onagers
browsed
greedily
and
which
supplied
a
sweet
pulp
of
excellent
flavor
there
too
the
colonists
again
found
groups
of
magnificent
kauries
their
cylindrical
trunks
crowded
with
a
cone
of
verdure
rising
to
a
height
of
two
hundred
feet
these
were
the
treekings
of
new
zealand
as
celebrated
as
the
cedars
of
lebanon
as
to
the
fauna
there
was
no
addition
to
those
species
already
known
to
the
hunters
nevertheless
they
saw
though
unable
to
get
near
them
a
couple
of
those
large
birds
peculiar
to
australia
a
sort
of
cassowary
called
emu
five
feet
in
height
and
with
brown
plumage
which
belong
to
the
tribe
of
waders
top
darted
after
them
as
fast
as
his
four
legs
could
carry
him
but
the
emus
distanced
him
with
ease
so
prodigious
was
their
speed
as
to
the
traces
left
by
the
convicts
a
few
more
were
discovered
some
footprints
found
near
an
apparently
recently
extinguished
fire
were
attentively
examined
by
the
settlers
by
measuring
them
one
after
the
other
according
to
their
length
and
breadth
the
marks
of
five
mens
feet
were
easily
distinguished
the
five
convicts
had
evidently
camped
on
this
spot
butand
this
was
the
object
of
so
minute
an
examinationa
sixth
footprint
could
not
be
discovered
which
in
that
case
would
have
been
that
of
ayrton
ayrton
was
not
with
them
said
herbert
no
answered
pencroft
and
if
he
was
not
with
them
it
was
because
the
wretches
had
already
murdered
him
but
then
these
rascals
have
not
a
den
to
which
they
may
be
tracked
like
tigers
no
replied
the
reporter
it
is
more
probable
that
they
wander
at
random
and
it
is
their
interest
to
rove
about
until
the
time
when
they
will
be
masters
of
the
island
the
masters
of
the
island
exclaimed
the
sailor
the
masters
of
the
island
he
repeated
and
his
voice
was
choked
as
if
his
throat
was
seized
in
an
iron
grasp
then
in
a
calmer
tone
do
you
know
captain
harding
said
he
what
the
ball
is
which
i
have
rammed
into
my
gun
no
pencroft
it
is
the
ball
that
went
through
herberts
chest
and
i
promise
you
it
wont
miss
its
mark
but
this
just
retaliation
would
not
bring
ayrton
back
to
life
and
from
the
examination
of
the
footprints
left
in
the
ground
they
must
alas
conclude
that
all
hopes
of
ever
seeing
him
again
must
be
abandoned
that
evening
they
encamped
fourteen
miles
from
granite
house
and
cyrus
harding
calculated
that
they
could
not
be
more
than
five
miles
from
reptile
point
and
indeed
the
next
day
the
extremity
of
the
peninsula
was
reached
and
the
whole
length
of
the
forest
had
been
traversed
but
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
the
retreat
in
which
the
convicts
had
taken
refuge
nor
that
no
less
secret
which
sheltered
the
mysterious
unknown
chapter
12
the
next
day
the
18th
of
february
was
devoted
to
the
exploration
of
all
that
wooded
region
forming
the
shore
from
reptile
end
to
falls
river
the
colonists
were
able
to
search
this
forest
thoroughly
for
as
it
was
comprised
between
the
two
shores
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
it
was
only
from
three
to
four
miles
in
breadth
the
trees
both
by
their
height
and
their
thick
foliage
bore
witness
to
the
vegetative
power
of
the
soil
more
astonishing
here
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
island
one
might
have
said
that
a
corner
from
the
virgin
forests
of
america
or
africa
had
been
transported
into
this
temperate
zone
this
led
them
to
conclude
that
the
superb
vegetation
found
a
heat
in
this
soil
damp
in
its
upper
layer
but
warmed
in
the
interior
by
volcanic
fires
which
could
not
belong
to
a
temperate
climate
the
most
frequently
occurring
trees
were
knaries
and
eucalypti
of
gigantic
dimensions
but
the
colonists
object
was
not
simply
to
admire
the
magnificent
vegetation
they
knew
already
that
in
this
respect
lincoln
island
would
have
been
worthy
to
take
the
first
rank
in
the
canary
group
to
which
the
first
name
given
was
that
of
the
happy
isles
now
alas
their
island
no
longer
belonged
to
them
entirely
others
had
taken
possession
of
it
miscreants
polluted
its
shores
and
they
must
be
destroyed
to
the
last
man
no
traces
were
found
on
the
western
coast
although
they
were
carefully
sought
for
no
more
footprints
no
more
broken
branches
no
more
deserted
camps
this
does
not
surprise
me
said
cyrus
harding
to
his
companions
the
convicts
first
landed
on
the
island
in
the
neighborhood
of
flotsam
point
and
they
immediately
plunged
into
the
far
west
forests
after
crossing
tadorn
marsh
they
then
followed
almost
the
same
route
that
we
took
on
leaving
granite
house
this
explains
the
traces
we
found
in
the
wood
but
arriving
on
the
shore
the
convicts
saw
at
once
that
they
would
discover
no
suitable
retreat
there
and
it
was
then
that
going
northwards
again
they
came
upon
the
corral
where
they
have
perhaps
returned
said
pencroft
i
do
not
think
so
answered
the
engineer
for
they
would
naturally
suppose
that
our
researches
would
be
in
that
direction
the
corral
is
only
a
storehouse
to
them
and
not
a
definitive
encampment
i
am
of
cyrus
opinion
said
the
reporter
and
i
think
that
it
is
among
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
that
the
convicts
will
have
made
their
lair
then
captain
straight
to
the
corral
cried
pencroft
we
must
finish
them
off
and
till
now
we
have
only
lost
time
no
my
friend
replied
the
engineer
you
forget
that
we
have
a
reason
for
wishing
to
know
if
the
forests
of
the
far
west
do
not
contain
some
habitation
our
exploration
has
a
double
object
pencroft
if
on
the
one
hand
we
have
to
chastise
crime
we
have
on
the
other
an
act
of
gratitude
to
perform
that
was
well
said
captain
replied
the
sailor
but
all
the
same
it
is
my
opinion
that
we
shall
not
find
the
gentleman
until
he
pleases
and
truly
pencroft
only
expressed
the
opinion
of
all
it
was
probable
that
the
strangers
retreat
was
not
less
mysterious
than
was
he
himself
that
evening
the
cart
halted
at
the
mouth
of
falls
river
the
camp
was
organized
as
usual
and
the
customary
precautions
were
taken
for
the
night
herbert
become
again
the
healthy
and
vigorous
lad
he
was
before
his
illness
derived
great
benefit
from
this
life
in
the
open
air
between
the
sea
breezes
and
the
vivifying
air
from
the
forests
his
place
was
no
longer
in
the
cart
but
at
the
head
of
the
troop
the
next
day
the
19th
of
february
the
colonists
leaving
the
shore
where
beyond
the
mouth
basalts
of
every
shape
were
so
picturesquely
piled
up
ascended
the
river
by
its
left
bank
the
road
had
been
already
partly
cleared
in
their
former
excursions
made
from
the
corral
to
the
west
coast
the
settlers
were
now
about
six
miles
from
mount
franklin
the
engineers
plan
was
thisto
minutely
survey
the
valley
forming
the
bed
of
the
river
and
to
cautiously
approach
the
neighborhood
of
the
corral
if
the
corral
was
occupied
to
seize
it
by
force
if
it
was
not
to
entrench
themselves
there
and
make
it
the
center
of
the
operations
which
had
for
their
object
the
exploration
of
mount
franklin
this
plan
was
unanimously
approved
by
the
colonists
for
they
were
impatient
to
regain
entire
possession
of
their
island
they
made
their
way
then
along
the
narrow
valley
separating
two
of
the
largest
spurs
of
mount
franklin
the
trees
crowded
on
the
rivers
bank
became
rare
on
the
upper
slopes
of
the
mountain
the
ground
was
hilly
and
rough
very
suitable
for
ambushes
and
over
which
they
did
not
venture
without
extreme
precaution
top
and
jup
skirmished
on
the
flanks
springing
right
and
left
through
the
thick
brushwood
and
emulating
each
other
in
intelligence
and
activity
but
nothing
showed
that
the
banks
of
the
stream
had
been
recently
frequentednothing
announced
either
the
presence
or
the
proximity
of
the
convicts
towards
five
in
the
evening
the
cart
stopped
nearly
600
feet
from
the
palisade
a
semicircular
screen
of
trees
still
hid
it
it
was
necessary
to
reconnoiter
the
corral
in
order
to
ascertain
if
it
was
occupied
to
go
there
openly
in
broad
daylight
when
the
convicts
were
probably
in
ambush
would
be
to
expose
themselves
as
poor
herbert
had
done
to
the
firearms
of
the
ruffians
it
was
better
then
to
wait
until
night
came
on
however
gideon
spilett
wished
without
further
delay
to
reconnoiter
the
approaches
to
the
corral
and
pencroft
who
was
quite
out
of
patience
volunteered
to
accompany
him
no
my
friends
said
the
engineer
wait
till
night
i
will
not
allow
one
of
you
to
expose
himself
in
open
day
but
captain
answered
the
sailor
little
disposed
to
obey
i
beg
of
you
pencroft
said
the
engineer
very
well
replied
the
sailor
who
vented
his
anger
in
another
way
by
bestowing
on
the
convicts
the
worst
names
in
his
maritime
vocabulary
the
colonists
remained
therefore
near
the
cart
and
carefully
watched
the
neighboring
parts
of
the
forest
three
hours
passed
thus
the
wind
had
fallen
and
absolute
silence
reigned
under
the
great
trees
the
snapping
of
the
smallest
twig
a
footstep
on
the
dry
leaves
the
gliding
of
a
body
among
the
grass
would
have
been
heard
without
difficulty
all
was
quiet
besides
top
lying
on
the
grass
his
head
stretched
out
on
his
paws
gave
no
sign
of
uneasiness
at
eight
oclock
the
day
appeared
far
enough
advanced
for
the
reconnaissance
to
be
made
under
favorable
conditions
gideon
spilett
declared
himself
ready
to
set
out
accompanied
by
pencroft
cyrus
harding
consented
top
and
jup
were
to
remain
with
the
engineer
herbert
and
neb
for
a
bark
or
a
cry
at
a
wrong
moment
would
give
the
alarm
do
not
be
imprudent
said
harding
to
the
reporter
and
pencroft
you
have
not
to
gain
possession
of
the
corral
but
only
to
find
out
whether
it
is
occupied
or
not
all
right
answered
pencroft
and
the
two
departed
under
the
trees
thanks
to
the
thickness
of
their
foliage
the
obscurity
rendered
any
object
invisible
beyond
a
radius
of
from
thirty
to
forty
feet
the
reporter
and
pencroft
halting
at
any
suspicious
sound
advanced
with
great
caution
they
walked
a
little
distance
apart
from
each
other
so
as
to
offer
a
less
mark
for
a
shot
and
to
tell
the
truth
they
expected
every
moment
to
hear
a
report
five
minutes
after
leaving
the
cart
gideon
spilett
and
pencroft
arrived
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
before
the
clearing
beyond
which
rose
the
palisade
they
stopped
a
few
straggling
beams
still
fell
on
the
field
clear
of
trees
thirty
feet
distant
was
the
gate
of
the
corral
which
appeared
to
be
closed
this
thirty
feet
which
it
was
necessary
to
cross
from
the
wood
to
the
palisade
constituted
the
dangerous
zone
to
borrow
a
ballistic
term
in
fact
one
or
more
bullets
fired
from
behind
the
palisade
might
knock
over
any
one
who
ventured
on
to
this
zone
gideon
spilett
and
the
sailor
were
not
men
to
draw
back
but
they
knew
that
any
imprudence
on
their
part
of
which
they
would
be
the
first
victims
would
fall
afterwards
on
their
companions
if
they
themselves
were
killed
what
would
become
of
harding
neb
and
herbert
but
pencroft
excited
at
feeling
himself
so
near
the
corral
where
he
supposed
the
convicts
had
taken
refuge
was
about
to
press
forward
when
the
reporter
held
him
back
with
a
grasp
of
iron
in
a
few
minutes
it
will
be
quite
dark
whispered
spilett
in
the
sailors
ear
then
will
be
the
time
to
act
pencroft
convulsively
clasping
the
buttend
of
his
gun
restrained
his
energies
and
waited
swearing
to
himself
soon
the
last
of
the
twilight
faded
away
darkness
which
seemed
as
if
it
issued
from
the
dense
forest
covered
the
clearing
mount
franklin
rose
like
an
enormous
screen
before
the
western
horizon
and
night
spread
rapidly
over
all
as
it
does
in
regions
of
low
latitudes
now
was
the
time
the
reporter
and
pencroft
since
posting
themselves
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
had
not
once
lost
sight
of
the
palisade
the
corral
appeared
to
be
absolutely
deserted
the
top
of
the
palisade
formed
a
line
a
little
darker
than
the
surrounding
shadow
and
nothing
disturbed
its
distinctness
nevertheless
if
the
convicts
were
there
they
must
have
posted
one
of
their
number
to
guard
against
any
surprise
spilett
grasped
his
companions
hand
and
both
crept
towards
the
corral
their
guns
ready
to
fire
they
reached
the
gate
without
the
darkness
being
illuminated
by
a
single
ray
of
light
pencroft
tried
to
push
open
the
gate
which
as
the
reporter
and
he
had
supposed
was
closed
however
the
sailor
was
able
to
ascertain
that
the
outer
bars
had
not
been
put
up
it
might
then
be
concluded
that
the
convicts
were
there
in
the
corral
and
that
very
probably
they
had
fastened
the
gate
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
not
be
forced
open
gideon
spilett
and
pencroft
listened
not
a
sound
could
be
heard
inside
the
palisade
the
musmons
and
the
goats
sleeping
no
doubt
in
their
huts
in
no
way
disturbed
the
calm
of
night
the
reporter
and
the
sailor
hearing
nothing
asked
themselves
whether
they
had
not
better
scale
the
palisades
and
penetrate
into
the
corral
this
would
have
been
contrary
to
cyrus
hardings
instructions
it
is
true
that
the
enterprise
might
succeed
but
it
might
also
fail
now
if
the
convicts
were
suspecting
nothing
if
they
knew
nothing
of
the
expedition
against
them
if
lastly
there
now
existed
a
chance
of
surprising
them
ought
this
chance
to
be
lost
by
inconsiderately
attempting
to
cross
the
palisades
this
was
not
the
reporters
opinion
he
thought
it
better
to
wait
until
all
the
settlers
were
collected
together
before
attempting
to
penetrate
into
the
corral
one
thing
was
certain
that
it
was
possible
to
reach
the
palisade
without
being
seen
and
also
that
it
did
not
appear
to
be
guarded
this
point
settled
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
return
to
the
cart
where
they
would
consult
pencroft
probably
agreed
with
this
decision
for
he
followed
the
reporter
without
making
any
objection
when
the
latter
turned
back
to
the
wood
in
a
few
minutes
the
engineer
was
made
acquainted
with
the
state
of
affairs
well
said
he
after
a
little
thought
i
now
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
convicts
are
not
in
the
corral
we
shall
soon
know
said
pencroft
when
we
have
scaled
the
palisade
to
the
corral
my
friends
said
cyrus
harding
shall
we
leave
the
cart
in
the
wood
asked
neb
no
replied
the
engineer
it
is
our
wagon
of
ammunition
and
provisions
and
if
necessary
it
would
serve
as
an
entrenchment
forward
then
said
gideon
spilett
the
cart
emerged
from
the
wood
and
began
to
roll
noiselessly
towards
the
palisade
the
darkness
was
now
profound
the
silence
as
complete
as
when
pencroft
and
the
reporter
crept
over
the
ground
the
thick
grass
completely
muffled
their
footsteps
the
colonists
held
themselves
ready
to
fire
jup
at
pencrofts
orders
kept
behind
neb
led
top
in
a
leash
to
prevent
him
from
bounding
forward
the
clearing
soon
came
in
sight
it
was
deserted
without
hesitating
the
little
band
moved
towards
the
palisade
in
a
short
space
of
time
the
dangerous
zone
was
passed
neb
remained
at
the
onagers
heads
to
hold
them
the
engineer
the
reporter
herbert
and
pencroft
proceeded
to
the
door
in
order
to
ascertain
if
it
was
barricaded
inside
it
was
open
what
do
you
say
now
asked
the
engineer
turning
to
the
sailor
and
spilett
both
were
stupefied
i
can
swear
said
pencroft
that
this
gate
was
shut
just
now
the
colonists
now
hesitated
were
the
convicts
in
the
corral
when
pencroft
and
the
reporter
made
their
reconnaissance
it
could
not
be
doubted
as
the
gate
then
closed
could
only
have
been
opened
by
them
were
they
still
there
or
had
one
of
their
number
just
gone
out
all
these
questions
presented
themselves
simultaneously
to
the
minds
of
the
colonists
but
how
could
they
be
answered
at
that
moment
herbert
who
had
advanced
a
few
steps
into
the
enclosure
drew
back
hurriedly
and
seized
hardings
hand
whats
the
matter
asked
the
engineer
a
light
in
the
house
yes
all
five
advanced
and
indeed
through
the
window
fronting
them
they
saw
glimmering
a
feeble
light
cyrus
harding
made
up
his
mind
rapidly
it
is
our
only
chance
said
he
to
his
companions
of
finding
the
convicts
collected
in
this
house
suspecting
nothing
they
are
in
our
power
forward
the
colonists
crossed
through
the
enclosure
holding
their
guns
ready
in
their
hands
the
cart
had
been
left
outside
under
the
charge
of
jup
and
top
who
had
been
prudently
tied
to
it
cyrus
harding
pencroft
and
gideon
spilett
on
one
side
herbert
and
neb
on
the
other
going
along
by
the
palisade
surveyed
the
absolutely
dark
and
deserted
corral
in
a
few
moments
they
were
near
the
closed
door
of
the
house
harding
signed
to
his
companions
not
to
stir
and
approached
the
window
then
feebly
lighted
by
the
inner
light
he
gazed
into
the
apartment
on
the
table
burned
a
lantern
near
the
table
was
the
bed
formerly
used
by
ayrton
on
the
bed
lay
the
body
of
a
man
suddenly
cyrus
harding
drew
back
and
in
a
hoarse
voiceayrton
he
exclaimed
immediately
the
door
was
forced
rather
than
opened
and
the
colonists
rushed
into
the
room
ayrton
appeared
to
be
asleep
his
countenance
showed
that
he
had
long
and
cruelly
suffered
on
his
wrists
and
ankles
could
be
seen
great
bruises
harding
bent
over
him
ayrton
cried
the
engineer
seizing
the
arm
of
the
man
whom
he
had
just
found
again
under
such
unexpected
circumstances
at
this
exclamation
ayrton
opened
his
eyes
and
gazing
at
harding
then
at
the
others
you
he
cried
you
ayrton
ayrton
repeated
harding
where
am
i
in
the
house
in
the
corral
alone
yes
but
they
will
come
back
cried
ayrton
defend
yourselves
defend
yourselves
and
he
fell
back
exhausted
spilett
exclaimed
the
engineer
we
may
be
attacked
at
any
moment
bring
the
cart
into
the
corral
then
barricade
the
door
and
all
come
back
here
pencroft
neb
and
the
reporter
hastened
to
execute
the
engineers
orders
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
perhaps
even
now
the
cart
was
in
the
hands
of
the
convicts
in
a
moment
the
reporter
and
his
two
companions
had
crossed
the
corral
and
reached
the
gate
of
the
palisade
behind
which
top
was
heard
growling
sullenly
the
engineer
leaving
ayrton
for
an
instant
came
out
ready
to
fire
herbert
was
at
his
side
both
surveyed
the
crest
of
the
spur
overlooking
the
corral
if
the
convicts
were
lying
in
ambush
there
they
might
knock
the
settlers
over
one
after
the
other
at
that
moment
the
moon
appeared
in
the
east
above
the
black
curtain
of
the
forest
and
a
white
sheet
of
light
spread
over
the
interior
of
the
enclosure
the
corral
with
its
clumps
of
trees
the
little
stream
which
watered
it
its
wide
carpet
of
grass
was
suddenly
illuminated
from
the
side
of
the
mountain
the
house
and
a
part
of
the
palisade
stood
out
white
in
the
moonlight
on
the
opposite
side
towards
the
door
the
enclosure
remained
dark
a
black
mass
soon
appeared
this
was
the
cart
entering
the
circle
of
light
and
cyrus
harding
could
hear
the
noise
made
by
the
door
as
his
companions
shut
it
and
fastened
the
interior
bars
but
at
that
moment
top
breaking
loose
began
to
bark
furiously
and
rush
to
the
back
of
the
corral
to
the
right
of
the
house
be
ready
to
fire
my
friends
cried
harding
the
colonists
raised
their
pieces
and
waited
the
moment
to
fire
top
still
barked
and
jup
running
towards
the
dog
uttered
shrill
cries
the
colonists
followed
him
and
reached
the
borders
of
the
little
stream
shaded
by
large
trees
and
there
in
the
bright
moonlight
what
did
they
see
five
corpses
stretched
on
the
bank
they
were
those
of
the
convicts
who
four
months
previously
had
landed
on
lincoln
island
chapter
13
how
had
it
happened
who
had
killed
the
convicts
was
it
ayrton
no
for
a
moment
before
he
was
dreading
their
return
but
ayrton
was
now
in
a
profound
stupor
from
which
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
rouse
him
after
uttering
those
few
words
he
had
again
become
unconscious
and
had
fallen
back
motionless
on
the
bed
the
colonists
a
prey
to
a
thousand
confused
thoughts
under
the
influence
of
violent
excitement
waited
all
night
without
leaving
ayrtons
house
or
returning
to
the
spot
where
lay
the
bodies
of
the
convicts
it
was
very
probable
that
ayrton
would
not
be
able
to
throw
any
light
on
the
circumstances
under
which
the
bodies
had
been
found
since
he
himself
was
not
aware
that
he
was
in
the
corral
but
at
any
rate
he
would
be
in
a
position
to
give
an
account
of
what
had
taken
place
before
this
terrible
execution
the
next
day
ayrton
awoke
from
his
torpor
and
his
companions
cordially
manifested
all
the
joy
they
felt
on
seeing
him
again
almost
safe
and
sound
after
a
hundred
and
four
days
separation
ayrton
then
in
a
few
words
recounted
what
had
happened
or
at
least
as
much
as
he
knew
the
day
after
his
arrival
at
the
corral
on
the
10th
of
last
november
at
nightfall
he
was
surprised
by
the
convicts
who
had
scaled
the
palisade
they
bound
and
gagged
him
then
he
was
led
to
a
dark
cavern
at
the
foot
of
mount
franklin
where
the
convicts
had
taken
refuge
his
death
had
been
decided
upon
and
the
next
day
the
convicts
were
about
to
kill
him
when
one
of
them
recognized
him
and
called
him
by
the
name
which
he
bore
in
australia
the
wretches
had
no
scruples
as
to
murdering
ayrton
they
spared
ben
joyce
but
from
that
moment
ayrton
was
exposed
to
the
importunities
of
his
former
accomplices
they
wished
him
to
join
them
again
and
relied
upon
his
aid
to
enable
them
to
gain
possession
of
granite
house
to
penetrate
into
that
hitherto
inaccessible
dwelling
and
to
become
masters
of
the
island
after
murdering
the
colonists
ayrton
remained
firm
the
once
convict
now
repentant
and
pardoned
would
rather
die
than
betray
his
companions
ayrtonbound
gagged
and
closely
watchedlived
in
this
cave
for
four
months
nevertheless
the
convicts
had
discovered
the
corral
a
short
time
after
their
arrival
in
the
island
and
since
then
they
had
subsisted
on
ayrtons
stores
but
did
not
live
at
the
corral
on
the
11th
of
november
two
of
the
villains
surprised
by
the
colonists
arrival
fired
at
herbert
and
one
of
them
returned
boasting
of
having
killed
one
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
but
he
returned
alone
his
companion
as
is
known
fell
by
cyrus
hardings
dagger
ayrtons
anxiety
and
despair
may
be
imagined
when
he
learned
the
news
of
herberts
death
the
settlers
were
now
only
four
and
as
it
seemed
at
the
mercy
of
the
convicts
after
this
event
and
during
all
the
time
that
the
colonists
detained
by
herberts
illness
remained
in
the
corral
the
pirates
did
not
leave
their
cavern
and
even
after
they
had
pillaged
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
they
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
abandon
it
the
illtreatment
inflicted
on
ayrton
was
now
redoubled
his
hands
and
feet
still
bore
the
bloody
marks
of
the
cords
which
bound
him
day
and
night
every
moment
he
expected
to
be
put
to
death
nor
did
it
appear
possible
that
he
could
escape
matters
remained
thus
until
the
third
week
of
february
the
convicts
still
watching
for
a
favorable
opportunity
rarely
quitted
their
retreat
and
only
made
a
few
hunting
excursions
either
to
the
interior
of
the
island
or
the
south
coast
ayrton
had
no
further
news
of
his
friends
and
relinquished
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
them
again
at
last
the
unfortunate
man
weakened
by
illtreatment
fell
into
a
prostration
so
profound
that
sight
and
hearing
failed
him
from
that
moment
that
is
to
say
since
the
last
two
days
he
could
give
no
information
whatever
of
what
had
occurred
but
captain
harding
he
added
since
i
was
imprisoned
in
that
cavern
how
is
it
that
i
find
myself
in
the
corral
how
is
it
that
the
convicts
are
lying
yonder
dead
in
the
middle
of
the
enclosure
answered
the
engineer
dead
cried
ayrton
half
rising
from
his
bed
notwithstanding
his
weakness
his
companions
supported
him
he
wished
to
get
up
and
with
their
assistance
he
did
so
they
then
proceeded
together
towards
the
little
stream
it
was
now
broad
daylight
there
on
the
bank
in
the
position
in
which
they
had
been
stricken
by
death
in
its
most
instantaneous
form
lay
the
corpses
of
the
five
convicts
ayrton
was
astounded
harding
and
his
companions
looked
at
him
without
uttering
a
word
on
a
sign
from
the
engineer
neb
and
pencroft
examined
the
bodies
already
stiffened
by
the
cold
they
bore
no
apparent
trace
of
any
wound
only
after
carefully
examining
them
pencroft
found
on
the
forehead
of
one
on
the
chest
of
another
on
the
back
of
this
one
on
the
shoulder
of
that
a
little
red
spot
a
sort
of
scarcely
visible
bruise
the
cause
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
conjecture
it
is
there
that
they
have
been
struck
said
cyrus
harding
but
with
what
weapon
cried
the
reporter
a
weapon
lightninglike
in
its
effects
and
of
which
we
have
not
the
secret
and
who
has
struck
the
blow
asked
pencroft
the
avenging
power
of
the
island
replied
harding
he
who
brought
you
here
ayrton
whose
influence
has
once
more
manifested
itself
who
does
for
us
all
that
which
we
cannot
do
for
ourselves
and
who
his
will
accomplished
conceals
himself
from
us
let
us
make
search
for
him
then
exclaimed
pencroft
yes
we
will
search
for
him
answered
harding
but
we
shall
not
discover
this
powerful
being
who
performs
such
wonders
until
he
pleases
to
call
us
to
him
this
invisible
protection
which
rendered
their
own
action
unavailing
both
irritated
and
piqued
the
engineer
the
relative
inferiority
which
it
proved
was
of
a
nature
to
wound
a
haughty
spirit
a
generosity
evinced
in
such
a
manner
as
to
elude
all
tokens
of
gratitude
implied
a
sort
of
disdain
for
those
on
whom
the
obligation
was
conferred
which
in
cyrus
hardings
eyes
marred
in
some
degree
the
worth
of
the
benefit
let
us
search
he
resumed
and
god
grant
that
we
may
some
day
be
permitted
to
prove
to
this
haughty
protector
that
he
has
not
to
deal
with
ungrateful
people
what
would
i
not
give
could
we
repay
him
by
rendering
him
in
our
turn
although
at
the
price
of
our
lives
some
signal
service
from
this
day
the
thoughts
of
the
inhabitants
of
lincoln
island
were
solely
occupied
with
the
intended
search
everything
incited
them
to
discover
the
answer
to
this
enigma
an
answer
which
would
only
be
the
name
of
a
man
endowed
with
a
truly
inexplicable
and
in
some
degree
superhuman
power
in
a
few
minutes
the
settlers
reentered
the
house
where
their
influence
soon
restored
to
ayrton
his
moral
and
physical
energy
neb
and
pencroft
carried
the
corpses
of
the
convicts
into
the
forest
some
distance
from
the
corral
and
buried
them
deep
in
the
ground
ayrton
was
then
made
acquainted
with
the
facts
which
had
occurred
during
his
seclusion
he
learned
herberts
adventures
and
through
what
various
trials
the
colonists
had
passed
as
to
the
settlers
they
had
despaired
of
ever
seeing
ayrton
again
and
had
been
convinced
that
the
convicts
had
ruthlessly
murdered
him
and
now
said
cyrus
harding
as
he
ended
his
recital
a
duty
remains
for
us
to
perform
half
of
our
task
is
accomplished
but
although
the
convicts
are
no
longer
to
be
feared
it
is
not
owing
to
ourselves
that
we
are
once
more
masters
of
the
island
well
answered
gideon
spilett
let
us
search
all
this
labyrinth
of
the
spurs
of
mount
franklin
we
will
not
leave
a
hollow
not
a
hole
unexplored
ah
if
ever
a
reporter
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
mystery
it
is
i
who
now
speak
to
you
my
friends
and
we
will
not
return
to
granite
house
until
we
have
found
our
benefactor
said
herbert
yes
said
the
engineer
we
will
do
all
that
it
is
humanly
possible
to
do
but
i
repeat
we
shall
not
find
him
until
he
himself
permits
us
shall
we
stay
at
the
corral
asked
pencroft
we
shall
stay
here
answered
harding
provisions
are
abundant
and
we
are
here
in
the
very
center
of
the
circle
we
have
to
explore
besides
if
necessary
the
cart
will
take
us
rapidly
to
granite
house
good
answered
the
sailor
only
i
have
a
remark
to
make
what
is
it
here
is
the
fine
season
getting
on
and
we
must
not
forget
that
we
have
a
voyage
to
make
a
voyage
said
gideon
spilett
yes
to
tabor
island
answered
pencroft
it
is
necessary
to
carry
a
notice
there
to
point
out
the
position
of
our
island
and
say
that
ayrton
is
here
in
case
the
scotch
yacht
should
come
to
take
him
off
who
knows
if
it
is
not
already
too
late
but
pencroft
asked
ayrton
how
do
you
intend
to
make
this
voyage
in
the
bonadventure
the
bonadventure
exclaimed
ayrton
she
no
longer
exists
my
bonadventure
exists
no
longer
shouted
pencroft
bounding
from
his
seat
no
answered
ayrton
the
convicts
discovered
her
in
her
little
harbor
only
eight
days
ago
they
put
to
sea
in
her
and
said
pencroft
his
heart
beating
and
not
having
bob
harvey
to
steer
her
they
ran
on
the
rocks
and
the
vessel
went
to
pieces
oh
the
villains
the
cutthroats
the
infamous
scoundrels
exclaimed
pencroft
pencroft
said
herbert
taking
the
sailors
hand
we
will
build
another
bonadventurea
larger
one
we
have
all
the
ironworkall
the
rigging
of
the
brig
at
our
disposal
but
do
you
know
returned
pencroft
that
it
will
take
at
least
five
or
six
months
to
build
a
vessel
of
from
thirty
to
forty
tons
we
can
take
our
time
said
the
reporter
and
we
must
give
up
the
voyage
to
tabor
island
for
this
year
oh
my
bonadventure
my
poor
bonadventure
cried
pencroft
almost
brokenhearted
at
the
destruction
of
the
vessel
of
which
he
was
so
proud
the
loss
of
the
bonadventure
was
certainly
a
thing
to
be
lamented
by
the
colonists
and
it
was
agreed
that
this
loss
should
be
repaired
as
soon
as
possible
this
settled
they
now
occupied
themselves
with
bringing
their
researches
to
bear
on
the
most
secret
parts
of
the
island
the
exploration
was
commenced
at
daybreak
on
the
19th
of
february
and
lasted
an
entire
week
the
base
of
the
mountain
with
its
spurs
and
their
numberless
ramifications
formed
a
labyrinth
of
valleys
and
elevations
it
was
evident
that
there
in
the
depths
of
these
narrow
gorges
perhaps
even
in
the
interior
of
mount
franklin
itself
was
the
proper
place
to
pursue
their
researches
no
part
of
the
island
could
have
been
more
suitable
to
conceal
a
dwelling
whose
occupant
wished
to
remain
unknown
but
so
irregular
was
the
formation
of
the
valleys
that
cyrus
harding
was
obliged
to
conduct
the
exploration
in
a
strictly
methodical
manner
the
colonists
first
visited
the
valley
opening
to
the
south
of
the
volcano
and
which
first
received
the
waters
of
falls
river
there
ayrton
showed
them
the
cavern
where
the
convicts
had
taken
refuge
and
in
which
he
had
been
imprisoned
until
his
removal
to
the
corral
this
cavern
was
just
as
ayrton
had
left
it
they
found
there
a
considerable
quantity
of
ammunition
and
provisions
conveyed
thither
by
the
convicts
in
order
to
form
a
reserve
the
whole
of
the
valley
bordering
on
the
cave
shaded
by
fir
and
other
trees
was
thoroughly
explored
and
on
turning
the
point
of
the
southwestern
spur
the
colonists
entered
a
narrower
gorge
similar
to
the
picturesque
columns
of
basalt
on
the
coast
here
the
trees
were
fewer
stones
took
the
place
of
grass
goats
and
musmons
gambolled
among
the
rocks
here
began
the
barren
part
of
the
island
it
could
already
be
seen
that
of
the
numerous
valleys
branching
off
at
the
base
of
mount
franklin
three
only
were
wooded
and
rich
in
pasturage
like
that
of
the
corral
which
bordered
on
the
west
on
the
falls
river
valley
and
on
the
east
on
the
red
creek
valley
these
two
streams
which
lower
down
became
rivers
by
the
absorption
of
several
tributaries
were
formed
by
all
the
springs
of
the
mountain
and
thus
caused
the
fertility
of
its
southern
part
as
to
the
mercy
it
was
more
directly
fed
from
ample
springs
concealed
under
the
cover
of
jacamar
wood
and
it
was
by
springs
of
this
nature
spreading
in
a
thousand
streamlets
that
the
soil
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
was
watered
now
of
these
three
wellwatered
valleys
either
might
have
served
as
a
retreat
to
some
solitary
who
would
have
found
there
everything
necessary
for
life
but
the
settlers
had
already
explored
them
and
in
no
part
had
they
discovered
the
presence
of
man
was
it
then
in
the
depths
of
those
barren
gorges
in
the
midst
of
the
piles
of
rock
in
the
rugged
northern
ravines
among
the
streams
of
lava
that
this
dwelling
and
its
occupant
would
be
found
the
northern
part
of
mount
franklin
was
at
its
base
composed
solely
of
two
valleys
wide
not
very
deep
without
any
appearance
of
vegetation
strewn
with
masses
of
rock
paved
with
lava
and
varied
with
great
blocks
of
mineral
this
region
required
a
long
and
careful
exploration
it
contained
a
thousand
cavities
comfortless
no
doubt
but
perfectly
concealed
and
difficult
of
access
the
colonists
even
visited
dark
tunnels
dating
from
the
volcanic
period
still
black
from
the
passage
of
the
fire
and
penetrated
into
the
depths
of
the
mountain
they
traversed
these
somber
galleries
waving
lighted
torches
they
examined
the
smallest
excavations
they
sounded
the
shallowest
depths
but
all
was
dark
and
silent
it
did
not
appear
that
the
foot
of
man
had
ever
before
trodden
these
ancient
passages
or
that
his
arm
had
ever
displaced
one
of
these
blocks
which
remained
as
the
volcano
had
cast
them
up
above
the
waters
at
the
time
of
the
submersion
of
the
island
however
although
these
passages
appeared
to
be
absolutely
deserted
and
the
obscurity
was
complete
cyrus
harding
was
obliged
to
confess
that
absolute
silence
did
not
reign
there
on
arriving
at
the
end
of
one
of
these
gloomy
caverns
extending
several
hundred
feet
into
the
interior
of
the
mountain
he
was
surprised
to
hear
a
deep
rumbling
noise
increased
in
intensity
by
the
sonorousness
of
the
rocks
gideon
spilett
who
accompanied
him
also
heard
these
distant
mutterings
which
indicated
a
revivification
of
the
subterranean
fires
several
times
both
listened
and
they
agreed
that
some
chemical
process
was
taking
place
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
then
the
volcano
is
not
totally
extinct
said
the
reporter
it
is
possible
that
since
our
exploration
of
the
crater
replied
cyrus
harding
some
change
has
occurred
any
volcano
although
considered
extinct
may
evidently
again
burst
forth
but
if
an
eruption
of
mount
franklin
occurred
asked
spilett
would
there
not
be
some
danger
to
lincoln
island
i
do
not
think
so
answered
the
reporter
the
crater
that
is
to
say
the
safetyvalve
exists
and
the
overflow
of
smoke
and
lava
would
escape
as
it
did
formerly
by
this
customary
outlet
unless
the
lava
opened
a
new
way
for
itself
towards
the
fertile
parts
of
the
island
and
why
my
dear
spilett
answered
cyrus
harding
should
it
not
follow
the
road
naturally
traced
out
for
it
well
volcanoes
are
capricious
returned
the
reporter
notice
answered
the
engineer
that
the
inclination
of
mount
franklin
favors
the
flow
of
water
towards
the
valleys
which
we
are
exploring
just
now
to
turn
aside
this
flow
an
earthquake
would
be
necessary
to
change
the
mountains
center
of
gravity
but
an
earthquake
is
always
to
be
feared
at
these
times
observed
gideon
spilett
always
replied
the
engineer
especially
when
the
subterranean
forces
begin
to
awake
as
they
risk
meeting
with
some
obstruction
after
a
long
rest
thus
my
dear
spilett
an
eruption
would
be
a
serious
thing
for
us
and
it
would
be
better
that
the
volcano
should
not
have
the
slightest
desire
to
wake
up
but
we
could
not
prevent
it
could
we
at
any
rate
even
if
it
should
occur
i
do
not
think
prospect
heights
would
be
seriously
threatened
between
them
and
the
mountain
the
ground
is
considerably
depressed
and
if
the
lava
should
ever
take
a
course
towards
the
lake
it
would
be
cast
on
the
downs
and
the
neighboring
parts
of
shark
gulf
we
have
not
yet
seen
any
smoke
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
to
indicate
an
approaching
eruption
said
gideon
spilett
no
answered
harding
not
a
vapor
escapes
from
the
crater
for
it
was
only
yesterday
that
i
attentively
surveyed
the
summit
but
it
is
probable
that
at
the
lower
part
of
the
chimney
time
may
have
accumulated
rocks
cinders
hardened
lava
and
that
this
valve
of
which
i
spoke
may
at
any
time
become
overcharged
but
at
the
first
serious
effort
every
obstacle
will
disappear
and
you
may
be
certain
my
dear
spilett
that
neither
the
island
which
is
the
boiler
nor
the
volcano
which
is
the
chimney
will
burst
under
the
pressure
of
gas
nevertheless
i
repeat
it
would
be
better
that
there
should
not
be
an
eruption
and
yet
we
are
not
mistaken
remarked
the
reporter
mutterings
can
be
distinctly
heard
in
the
very
bowels
of
the
volcano
you
are
right
said
the
engineer
again
listening
attentively
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
a
commotion
is
going
on
there
of
which
we
can
neither
estimate
the
importance
nor
the
ultimate
result
cyrus
harding
and
spilett
on
coming
out
rejoined
their
companions
to
whom
they
made
known
the
state
of
affairs
very
well
cried
pencroft

volcano

to
play
his
pranks

him
try
if
he
likes
he
will
find
his

asked

good

neb
our
good
genius
who
will
shut
his
mouth
for
him
if
he
so
much
as
pretends
to
open
it
as
may
be
seen
the
sailors
confidence
in
the
tutelary
deity
of
his
island
was
absolute
and
certainly
the
occult
power
manifested
until
now
in
so
many
inexplicable
ways
appeared
to
be
unlimited
but
also
it
knew
how
to
escape
the
colonists
most
minute
researches
for
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
in
spite
of
the
more
than
zealthe
obstinacywith
which
they
carried
on
their
exploration
the
retreat
of
the
mysterious
being
could
not
be
discovered
from
the
19th
to
the
20th
of
february
the
circle
of
investigation
was
extended
to
all
the
northern
region
of
lincoln
island
whose
most
secret
nooks
were
explored
the
colonists
even
went
the
length
of
tapping
every
rock
the
search
was
extended
to
the
extreme
verge
of
the
mountain
it
was
explored
thus
to
the
very
summit
of
the
truncated
cone
terminating
the
first
row
of
rocks
then
to
the
upper
ridge
of
the
enormous
hat
at
the
bottom
of
which
opened
the
crater
they
did
more
they
visited
the
gulf
now
extinct
but
in
whose
depths
the
rumbling
could
be
distinctly
heard
however
no
sign
of
smoke
or
vapor
no
heating
of
the
rock
indicated
an
approaching
eruption
but
neither
there
nor
in
any
other
part
of
mount
franklin
did
the
colonists
find
any
traces
of
him
of
whom
they
were
in
search
their
investigations
were
then
directed
to
the
downs
they
carefully
examined
the
high
lavacliffs
of
shark
gulf
from
the
base
to
the
crest
although
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
reach
even
the
level
of
the
gulf
no
onenothing
indeed
in
these
three
words
was
summed
up
so
much
fatigue
uselessly
expended
so
much
energy
producing
no
results
that
somewhat
of
anger
mingled
with
the
discomfiture
of
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
it
was
now
time
to
think
of
returning
for
these
researches
could
not
be
prolonged
indefinitely
the
colonists
were
certainly
right
in
believing
that
the
mysterious
being
did
not
reside
on
the
surface
of
the
island
and
the
wildest
fancies
haunted
their
excited
imaginations
pencroft
and
neb
particularly
were
not
contented
with
the
mystery
but
allowed
their
imaginations
to
wander
into
the
domain
of
the
supernatural
on
the
25th
of
february
the
colonists
reentered
granite
house
and
by
means
of
the
double
cord
carried
by
an
arrow
to
the
threshold
of
the
door
they
reestablished
communication
between
their
habitation
and
the
ground
a
month
later
they
commemorated
on
the
25th
of
march
the
third
anniversary
of
their
arrival
on
lincoln
island
chapter
14
three
years
had
passed
away
since
the
escape
of
the
prisoners
from
richmond
and
how
often
during
those
three
years
had
they
spoken
of
their
country
always
present
in
their
thoughts
they
had
no
doubt
that
the
civil
war
was
at
an
end
and
to
them
it
appeared
impossible
that
the
just
cause
of
the
north
had
not
triumphed
but
what
had
been
the
incidents
of
this
terrible
war
how
much
blood
had
it
not
cost
how
many
of
their
friends
must
have
fallen
in
the
struggle
they
often
spoke
of
these
things
without
as
yet
being
able
to
foresee
the
day
when
they
would
be
permitted
once
more
to
see
their
country
to
return
thither
were
it
but
for
a
few
days
to
renew
the
social
link
with
the
inhabited
world
to
establish
a
communication
between
their
native
land
and
their
island
then
to
pass
the
longest
perhaps
the
best
portion
of
their
existence
in
this
colony
founded
by
them
and
which
would
then
be
dependent
on
their
country
was
this
a
dream
impossible
to
realize
there
were
only
two
ways
of
accomplishing
iteither
a
ship
must
appear
off
lincoln
island
or
the
colonists
must
themselves
build
a
vessel
strong
enough
to
sail
to
the
nearest
land
unless
said
pencroft
our
good
genius
himself
provides
us
with
the
means
of
returning
to
our
country
and
really
had
any
one
told
pencroft
and
neb
that
a
ship
of
300
tons
was
waiting
for
them
in
shark
gulf
or
at
port
balloon
they
would
not
even
have
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
in
their
state
of
mind
nothing
appeared
improbable
but
cyrus
harding
less
confident
advised
them
to
confine
themselves
to
fact
and
more
especially
so
with
regard
to
the
building
of
a
vessela
really
urgent
work
since
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
depositing
as
soon
as
possible
at
tabor
island
a
document
indicating
ayrtons
new
residence
as
the
bonadventure
no
longer
existed
six
months
at
least
would
be
required
for
the
construction
of
a
new
vessel
now
winter
was
approaching
and
the
voyage
would
not
be
made
before
the
following
spring
we
have
time
to
get
everything
ready
for
the
fine
season
remarked
the
engineer
who
was
consulting
with
pencroft
about
these
matters
i
think
therefore
my
friend
that
since
we
have
to
rebuild
our
vessel
it
will
be
best
to
give
her
larger
dimensions
the
arrival
of
the
scotch
yacht
at
tabor
island
is
very
uncertain
it
may
even
be
that
having
arrived
several
months
ago
she
has
again
sailed
after
having
vainly
searched
for
some
trace
of
ayrton
will
it
not
then
be
best
to
build
a
ship
which
if
necessary
could
take
us
either
to
the
polynesian
archipelago
or
to
new
zealand
what
do
you
think
i
think
captain
answered
the
sailor
i
think
that
you
are
as
capable
of
building
a
large
vessel
as
a
small
one
neither
the
wood
nor
the
tools
are
wanting
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
and
how
many
months
would
be
required
to
build
a
vessel
of
from
250
to
300
tons
asked
harding
seven
or
eight
months
at
least
replied
pencroft
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
winter
is
drawing
near
and
that
in
severe
frost
wood
is
difficult
to
work
we
must
calculate
on
several
weeks
delay
and
if
our
vessel
is
ready
by
next
november
we
may
think
ourselves
very
lucky
well
replied
cyrus
harding
that
will
be
exactly
the
most
favorable
time
for
undertaking
a
voyage
of
any
importance
either
to
tabor
island
or
to
a
more
distant
land
so
it
will
captain
answered
the
sailor
make
out
your
plans
then
the
workmen
are
ready
and
i
imagine
that
ayrton
can
lend
us
a
good
helping
hand
the
colonists
having
been
consulted
approved
the
engineers
plan
and
it
was
indeed
the
best
thing
to
be
done
it
is
true
that
the
construction
of
a
ship
of
from
two
to
three
hundred
tons
would
be
great
labor
but
the
colonists
had
confidence
in
themselves
justified
by
their
previous
success
cyrus
harding
then
busied
himself
in
drawing
the
plan
of
the
vessel
and
making
the
model
during
this
time
his
companions
employed
themselves
in
felling
and
carting
trees
to
furnish
the
ribs
timbers
and
planks
the
forest
of
the
far
west
supplied
the
best
oaks
and
elms
they
took
advantage
of
the
opening
already
made
on
their
last
excursion
to
form
a
practicable
road
which
they
named
the
far
west
road
and
the
trees
were
carried
to
the
chimneys
where
the
dockyard
was
established
as
to
the
road
in
question
the
choice
of
trees
had
rendered
its
direction
somewhat
capricious
but
at
the
same
time
it
facilitated
the
access
to
a
large
part
of
the
serpentine
peninsula
it
was
important
that
the
trees
should
be
quickly
felled
and
cut
up
for
they
could
not
be
used
while
yet
green
and
some
time
was
necessary
to
allow
them
to
get
seasoned
the
carpenters
therefore
worked
vigorously
during
the
month
of
april
which
was
troubled
only
by
a
few
equinoctial
gales
of
some
violence
master
jup
aided
them
dexterously
either
by
climbing
to
the
top
of
a
tree
to
fasten
the
ropes
or
by
lending
his
stout
shoulders
to
carry
the
lopped
trunks
all
this
timber
was
piled
up
under
a
large
shed
built
near
the
chimneys
and
there
awaited
the
time
for
use
the
month
of
april
was
tolerably
fine
as
october
often
is
in
the
northern
zone
at
the
same
time
other
work
was
actively
continued
and
soon
all
trace
of
devastation
disappeared
from
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
the
mill
was
rebuilt
and
new
buildings
rose
in
the
poultryyard
it
had
appeared
necessary
to
enlarge
their
dimensions
for
the
feathered
population
had
increased
considerably
the
stable
now
contained
five
onagers
four
of
which
were
well
broken
and
allowed
themselves
to
be
either
driven
or
ridden
and
a
little
colt
the
colony
now
possessed
a
plow
to
which
the
onagers
were
yoked
like
regular
yorkshire
or
kentucky
oxen
the
colonists
divided
their
work
and
their
arms
never
tired
then
who
could
have
enjoyed
better
health
than
these
workers
and
what
good
humor
enlivened
the
evenings
in
granite
house
as
they
formed
a
thousand
plans
for
the
future
as
a
matter
of
course
ayrton
shared
the
common
lot
in
every
respect
and
there
was
no
longer
any
talk
of
his
going
to
live
at
the
corral
nevertheless
he
was
still
sad
and
reserved
and
joined
more
in
the
work
than
in
the
pleasures
of
his
companions
but
he
was
a
valuable
workman
at
needstrong
skilful
ingenious
intelligent
he
was
esteemed
and
loved
by
all
and
he
could
not
be
ignorant
of
it
in
the
meanwhile
the
corral
was
not
abandoned
every
other
day
one
of
the
settlers
driving
the
cart
or
mounted
on
an
onager
went
to
look
after
the
flock
of
musmons
and
goats
and
bring
back
the
supply
of
milk
required
by
neb
these
excursions
at
the
same
time
afforded
opportunities
for
hunting
therefore
herbert
and
gideon
spilett
with
top
in
front
traversed
more
often
than
their
companions
the
road
to
the
corral
and
with
the
capital
guns
which
they
carried
capybaras
agouties
kangaroos
and
wild
pigs
for
large
game
ducks
grouse
jacamars
and
snipe
for
small
game
were
never
wanting
in
the
house
the
produce
of
the
warren
of
the
oysterbed

scarcely
by
himself
store
them
away
the
telegraphic
wire
between
the
corral
and
granite
house
had
of
course
been
repaired
and
it
was
worked
whenever
one
or
other
of
the
settlers
was
at
the
corral
and
found
it
necessary
to
spend
the
night
there
besides
the
island
was
safe
now
and
no
attacks
were
to
be
feared
at
any
rate
from
men
however
that
which
had
happened
might
happen
again
a
descent
of
pirates
or
even
of
escaped
convicts
was
always
to
be
feared
it
was
possible
that
companions
or
accomplices
of
bob
harvey
had
been
in
the
secret
of
his
plans
and
might
be
tempted
to
imitate
him
the
colonists
therefore
were
careful
to
observe
the
sea
around
the
island
and
every
day
their
telescope
covered
the
horizon
enclosed
by
union
and
washington
bays
when
they
went
to
the
corral
they
examined
the
sea
to
the
west
with
no
less
attention
and
by
climbing
the
spur
their
gaze
extended
over
a
large
section
of
the
western
horizon
nothing
suspicious
was
discerned
but
still
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
be
on
their
guard
the
engineer
one
evening
imparted
to
his
friends
a
plan
which
he
had
conceived
for
fortifying
the
corral
it
appeared
prudent
to
him
to
heighten
the
palisade
and
to
flank
it
with
a
sort
of
blockhouse
which
if
necessary
the
settlers
could
hold
against
the
enemy
granite
house
might
by
its
very
position
be
considered
impregnable
therefore
the
corral
with
its
buildings
its
stores
and
the
animals
it
contained
would
always
be
the
object
of
pirates
whoever
they
were
who
might
land
on
the
island
and
should
the
colonists
be
obliged
to
shut
themselves
up
there
they
ought
also
to
be
able
to
defend
themselves
without
any
disadvantage
this
was
a
project
which
might
be
left
for
consideration
and
they
were
besides
obliged
to
put
off
its
execution
until
the
next
spring
about
the
15th
of
may
the
keel
of
the
new
vessel
lay
along
the
dockyard
and
soon
the
stem
and
sternpost
mortised
at
each
of
its
extremities
rose
almost
perpendicularly
the
keel
of
good
oak
measured
110
feet
in
length
this
allowing
a
width
of
fiveandtwenty
feet
to
the
midship
beam
but
this
was
all
the
carpenters
could
do
before
the
arrival
of
the
frosts
and
bad
weather
during
the
following
week
they
fixed
the
first
of
the
stern
timbers
but
were
then
obliged
to
suspend
work
during
the
last
days
of
the
month
the
weather
was
extremely
bad
the
wind
blew
from
the
east
sometimes
with
the
violence
of
a
tempest
the
engineer
was
somewhat
uneasy
on
account
of
the
dockyard
shedwhich
besides
he
could
not
have
established
in
any
other
place
near
to
granite
housefor
the
islet
only
imperfectly
sheltered
the
shore
from
the
fury
of
the
open
sea
and
in
great
storms
the
waves
beat
against
the
very
foot
of
the
granite
cliff
but
very
fortunately
these
fears
were
not
realized
the
wind
shifted
to
the
southeast
and
there
the
beach
of
granite
house
was
completely
covered
by
flotsam
point
pencroft
and
ayrton
the
most
zealous
workmen
at
the
new
vessel
pursued
their
labor
as
long
as
they
could
they
were
not
men
to
mind
the
wind
tearing
at
their
hair
nor
the
rain
wetting
them
to
the
skin
and
a
blow
from
a
hammer
is
worth
just
as
much
in
bad
as
in
fine
weather
but
when
a
severe
frost
succeeded
this
wet
period
the
wood
its
fibers
acquiring
the
hardness
of
iron
became
extremely
difficult
to
work
and
about
the
10th
of
june
shipbuilding
was
obliged
to
be
entirely
discontinued
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
had
not
omitted
to
observe
how
severe
was
the
temperature
during
the
winters
of
lincoln
island
the
cold
was
comparable
to
that
experienced
in
the
states
of
new
england
situated
at
almost
the
same
distance
from
the
equator
in
the
northern
hemisphere
or
at
any
rate
in
the
part
occupied
by
british
america
and
the
north
of
the
united
states
this
phenomenon
is
explained
by
the
flat
conformation
of
the
territories
bordering
on
the
pole
and
on
which
there
is
no
intumescence
of
the
soil
to
oppose
any
obstacle
to
the
north
winds
here
in
lincoln
island
this
explanation
would
not
suffice
it
has
even
been
observed
remarked
harding
one
day
to
his
companions
that
in
equal
latitudes
the
islands
and
coast
regions
are
less
tried
by
the
cold
than
inland
countries
i
have
often
heard
it
asserted
that
the
winters
of
lombardy
for
example
are
not
less
rigorous
than
those
of
scotland
which
results
from
the
sea
restoring
during
the
winter
the
heat
which
it
received
during
the
summer
islands
are
therefore
in
a
better
situation
for
benefiting
by
this
restitution
but
then
captain
harding
asked
herbert
why
does
lincoln
island
appear
to
escape
the
common
law
that
is
difficult
to
explain
answered
the
engineer
however
i
should
be
disposed
to
conjecture
that
this
peculiarity
results
from
the
situation
of
the
island
in
the
southern
hemisphere
which
as
you
know
my
boy
is
colder
than
the
northern
hemisphere
yes
said
herbert
and
icebergs
are
met
with
in
lower
latitudes
in
the
south
than
in
the
north
of
the
pacific
that
is
true
remarked
pencroft
and
when
i
have
been
serving
on
board
whalers
i
have
seen
icebergs
off
cape
horn
the
severe
cold
experienced
in
lincoln
island
said
gideon
spilett
may
then
perhaps
be
explained
by
the
presence
of
floes
or
icebergs
comparatively
near
to
lincoln
island
your
opinion
is
very
admissible
indeed
my
dear
spilett
answered
cyrus
harding
and
it
is
evidently
to
the
proximity
of
icebergs
that
we
owe
our
rigorous
winters
i
would
draw
your
attention
also
to
an
entirely
physical
cause
which
renders
the
southern
colder
than
the
northern
hemisphere
in
fact
since
the
sun
is
nearer
to
this
hemisphere
during
the
summer
it
is
necessarily
more
distant
during
the
winter
this
explains
then
the
excess
of
temperature
in
the
two
seasons
for
if
we
find
the
winters
very
cold
in
lincoln
island
we
must
not
forget
that
the
summers
here
on
the
contrary
are
very
hot
but
why
if
you
please
captain
asked
pencroft
knitting
his
brows
why
should
our
hemisphere
as
you
say
be
so
badly
divided
it
isnt
just
that
friend
pencroft
answered
the
engineer
laughing
whether
just
or
not
we
must
submit
to
it
and
here
lies
the
reason
for
this
peculiarity
the
earth
does
not
describe
a
circle
around
the
sun
but
an
ellipse
as
it
must
by
the
laws
of
rational
mechanics
now
the
earth
occupies
one
of
the
foci
of
the
ellipse
and
so
at
one
point
in
its
course
is
at
its
apogee
that
is
at
its
farthest
from
the
sun
and
at
another
point
it
is
at
its
perigee
or
nearest
to
the
sun
now
it
happens
that
it
is
during
the
winter
of
the
southern
countries
that
it
is
at
its
most
distant
point
from
the
sun
and
consequently
in
a
situation
for
those
regions
to
feel
the
greatest
cold
nothing
can
be
done
to
prevent
that
and
men
pencroft
however
learned
they
may
be
can
never
change
anything
of
the
cosmographical
order
established
by
god
himself
and
yet
added
pencroft
the
world
is
very
learned
what
a
big
book
captain
might
be
made
with
all
that
is
known
and
what
a
much
bigger
book
still
with
all
that
is
not
known
answered
harding
at
last
for
one
reason
or
another
the
month
of
june
brought
the
cold
with
its
accustomed
intensity
and
the
settlers
were
often
confined
to
granite
house
ah
how
wearisome
this
imprisonment
was
to
them
and
more
particularly
to
gideon
spilett
look
here
said
he
to
neb
one
day
i
would
give
you
by
notarial
deed
all
the
estates
which
will
come
to
me
some
day
if
you
were
a
good
enough
fellow
to
go
no
matter
where
and
subscribe
to
some
newspaper
for
me
decidedly
the
thing
that
is
most
essential
to
my
happiness
is
the
knowing
every
morning
what
has
happened
the
day
before
in
other
places
than
this
neb
began
to
laugh
pon
my
word
he
replied
the
only
thing
i
think
about
is
my
daily
work
the
truth
was
that
indoors
as
well
as
out
there
was
no
want
of
work
the
colony
of
lincoln
island
was
now
at
its
highest
point
of
prosperity
achieved
by
three
years
of
continued
hard
work
the
destruction
of
the
brig
had
been
a
new
source
of
riches
without
speaking
of
the
complete
rig
which
would
serve
for
the
vessel
now
on
the
stocks
utensils
and
tools
of
all
sorts
weapons
and
ammunition
clothes
and
instruments
were
now
piled
in
the
storerooms
of
granite
house
it
had
not
even
been
necessary
to
resort
again
to
the
manufacture
of
the
coarse
felt
materials
though
the
colonists
had
suffered
from
cold
during
their
first
winter
the
bad
season
might
now
come
without
their
having
any
reason
to
dread
its
severity
linen
was
plentiful
also
and
besides
they
kept
it
with
extreme
care
from
chloride
of
sodium
which
is
nothing
else
than
sea
salt
cyrus
harding
easily
extracted
the
soda
and
chlorine
the
soda
which
it
was
easy
to
change
into
carbonate
of
soda
and
the
chlorine
of
which
he
made
chloride
of
lime
were
employed
for
various
domestic
purposes
and
especially
in
bleaching
linen
besides
they
did
not
wash
more
than
four
times
a
year
as
was
done
by
families
in
the
olden
times
and
it
may
be
added
that
pencroft
and
gideon
spilett
while
waiting
for
the
postman
to
bring
him
his
newspaper
distinguished
themselves
as
washermen
so
passed
the
winter
months
june
july
and
august
they
were
severe
and
the
average
observations
of
the
thermometer
did
not
give
more
than
eight
degrees
of
fahrenheit
it
was
therefore
lower
in
temperature
than
the
preceding
winter
but
then
what
splendid
fires
blazed
continually
on
the
hearths
of
granite
house
the
smoke
marking
the
granite
wall
with
long
zebralike
streaks
fuel
was
not
spared
as
it
grew
naturally
a
few
steps
from
them
besides
the
chips
of
the
wood
destined
for
the
construction
of
the
ship
enabled
them
to
economize
the
coal
which
required
more
trouble
to
transport
men
and
animals
were
all
well
master
jup
was
a
little
chilly
it
must
be
confessed
this
was
perhaps
his
only
weakness
and
it
was
necessary
to
make
him
a
wellpadded
dressinggown
but
what
a
servant
he
was
clever
zealous
indefatigable
not
indiscreet
not
talkative
and
he
might
have
been
with
reason
proposed
as
a
model
for
all
his
biped
brothers
in
the
old
and
new
worlds
as
for
that
said
pencroft
when
one
has
four
hands
at
ones
service
of
course
ones
work
ought
to
be
done
so
much
the
better
and
indeed
the
intelligent
creature
did
it
well
during
the
seven
months
which
had
passed
since
the
last
researches
made
round
the
mountain
and
during
the
month
of
september
which
brought
back
fine
weather
nothing
was
heard
of
the
genius
of
the
island
his
power
was
not
manifested
in
any
way
it
is
true
that
it
would
have
been
superfluous
for
no
incident
occurred
to
put
the
colonists
to
any
painful
trial
cyrus
harding
even
observed
that
if
by
chance
the
communication
between
the
unknown
and
the
tenants
of
granite
house
had
ever
been
established
through
the
granite
and
if
tops
instinct
had
as
it
were
felt
it
there
was
no
further
sign
of
it
during
this
period
the
dogs
growling
had
entirely
ceased
as
well
as
the
uneasiness
of
the
orang
the
two
friendsfor
they
were
suchno
longer
prowled
round
the
opening
of
the
inner
well
nor
did
they
bark
or
whine
in
that
singular
way
which
from
the
first
the
engineer
had
noticed
but
could
he
be
sure
that
this
was
all
that
was
to
be
said
about
this
enigma
and
that
he
should
never
arrive
at
a
solution
could
he
be
certain
that
some
conjuncture

future

an
event
the
consequences

in

of
the

the
colonists
warned
by
the
engineer
left
their
work
and
gazed
in
silence
at
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
the
volcano
had
awoke
and
the
vapor
had
penetrated
the
mineral
layer
heaped
at
the
bottom
of
the
crater
but
would
the
subterranean
fires
provoke
any
violent
eruption
this
was
an
event
which
could
not
be
foreseen
however
even
while
admitting
the
possibility
of
an
eruption
it
was
not
probable
that
the
whole
of
lincoln
island
would
suffer
from
it
the
flow
of
volcanic
matter
is
not
always
disastrous
and
the
island
had
already
undergone
this
trial
as
was
shown
by
the
streams
of
lava
hardened
on
the
northern
slopes
of
the
mountain
besides
from
the
shape
of
the
craterthe
opening
broken
in
the
upper
edgethe
matter
would
be
thrown
to
the
side
opposite
the
fertile
regions
of
the
island
however
the
past
did
not
necessarily
answer
for
the
future
often
at
the
summit
of
volcanoes
the
old
craters
close
and
new
ones
open
this
had
occurred
in
the
two
hemispheresat
etna
popocatepetl
at
orizabaand
on
the
eve
of
an
eruption
there
is
everything
to
be
feared
in
fact
an
earthquakea
phenomenon
which
often
accompanies

eruptionis
enough
to
change
the
interior
arrangement
of
a
mountain
and
to
open
new
outlets
for
the
burning
lava
cyrus
harding
explained
these
things
to
his
companions
and
without
exaggerating
the
state
of
things
he
told
them
all
the
pros
and
cons
after
all
they
could
not
prevent
it
it
did
not
appear
likely
that
granite
house
would
be
threatened
unless
the
ground
was
shaken
by
an
earthquake
but
the
corral
would
be
in
great
danger
should
a
new
crater
open
in
the
southern
side
of
mount
franklin
from
that
day
the
smoke
never
disappeared
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
it
could
even
be
perceived
that
it
increased
in
height
and
thickness
without
any
flame
mingling
in
its
heavy
volumes
the
phenomenon
was
still
concentrated
in
the
lower
part
of
the
central
crater
however
with
the
fine
days
work
had
been
continued
the
building
of
the
vessel
was
hastened
as
much
as
possible
and
by
means
of
the
waterfall
on
the
shore
cyrus
harding
managed
to
establish
an
hydraulic
sawmill
which
rapidly
cut
up
the
trunks
of
trees
into
planks
and
joists
the
mechanism
of
this
apparatus
was
as
simple
as
those
used
in
the
rustic
sawmills
of
norway
a
first
horizontal
movement
to
move
the
piece
of
wood
a
second
vertical
movement
to
move
the
sawthis
was
all
that
was
wanted
and
the
engineer
succeeded
by
means
of
a
wheel
two
cylinders
and
pulleys
properly
arranged
towards
the
end
of
the
month
of
september
the
skeleton
of
the
vessel
which
was
to
be
rigged
as
a
schooner
lay
in
the
dockyard
the
ribs
were
almost
entirely
completed
and
all
the
timbers
having
been
sustained
by
a
provisional
band
the
shape
of
the
vessel
could
already
be
seen
the
schooner
sharp
in
the
bows
very
slender
in
the
afterpart
would
evidently
be
suitable
for
a
long
voyage
if
wanted
but
laying
the
planking
would
still
take
a
considerable
time
very
fortunately
the
iron
work
of
the
pirate
brig
had
been
saved
after
the
explosion
from
the
planks
and
injured
ribs
pencroft
and
ayrton
had
extracted
the
bolts
and
a
large
quantity
of
copper
nails
it
was
so
much
work
saved
for
the
smiths
but
the
carpenters
had
much
to
do
shipbuilding
was
interrupted
for
a
week
for
the
harvest
the
haymaking
and
the
gathering
in
of
the
different
crops
on
the
plateau
this
work
finished
every
moment
was
devoted
to
finishing
the
schooner
when
night
came
the
workmen
were
really
quite
exhausted
so
as
not
to
lose
any
time
they
had
changed
the
hours
for
their
meals
they
dined
at
twelve
oclock
and
only
had
their
supper
when
daylight
failed
them
they
then
ascended
to
granite
house
when
they
were
always
ready
to
go
to
bed
sometimes
however
when
the
conversation
bore
on
some
interesting
subject
the
hour
for
sleep
was
delayed
for
a
time
the
colonists
then
spoke
of
the
future
and
talked
willingly
of
the
changes
which
a
voyage
in
the
schooner
to
inhabited
lands
would
make
in
their
situation
but
always
in
the
midst
of
these
plans
prevailed
the
thought
of
a
subsequent
return
to
lincoln
island
never
would
they
abandon
this
colony
founded
with
so
much
labor
and
with
such
success
and
to
which
a
communication
with
america
would
afford
a
fresh
impetus
pencroft
and
neb
especially
hoped
to
end
their
days
there
herbert
said
the
sailor
you
will
never
abandon
lincoln
island
never
pencroft
and
especially
if
you
make
up
your
mind
to
stay
there
that
was
made
up
long
ago
my
boy
answered
pencroft
i
shall
expect
you
you
will
bring
me
your
wife
and
children
and
i
shall
make
jolly
chaps
of
your
youngsters
thats
agreed
replied
herbert
laughing
and
blushing
at
the
same
time
and
you
captain
harding
resumed
pencroft
enthusiastically
you
will
be
still
the
governor
of
the
island
ah
how
many
inhabitants
could
it
support
ten
thousand
at
least
they
talked
in
this
way
allowing
pencroft
to
run
on
and
at
last
the
reporter
actually
started
a
newspaperthe
new
lincoln
herald
so
is
mans
heart
the
desire
to
perform
a
work
which
will
endure
which
will
survive
him
is
the
origin
of
his
superiority
over
all
other
living
creatures
here
below
it
is
this
which
has
established
his
dominion
and
this
it
is
which
justifies
it
over
all
the
world
after
that
who
knows
if
jup
and
top
had
not
themselves
their
little
dream
of
the
future
ayrton
silently
said
to
himself
that
he
would
like
to
see
lord
glenarvan
again
and
show
himself
to
all
restored
one
evening
on
the
15th
of
october
the
conversation
was
prolonged
later
than
usual
it
was
nine
oclock
already
long
badly
concealed
yawns
gave
warning
of
the
hour
of
rest
and
pencroft
was
proceeding
towards
his
bed
when
the
electric
bell
placed
in
the
diningroom
suddenly
rang
all
were
there
cyrus

herbert
ayrton
pencroft
neb
therefore
none
of
the
colonists
were
at
the
corral
cyrus
harding
rose
his
companions
stared
at
each
other
scarcely
believing
their
ears
what
does
that
mean
cried
neb
was
it
the
devil
who
rang
it
no
one
answered
the

observed
herbert

not
its
influence

herbert
did
not
finish
his
phrase
the
engineer
towards
whom
all
eyes
were
turned
shook
his
head
negatively
we
must
wait
said
gideon
spilett
if
it
is
a
signal
whoever
it
may
be
who
has
made
it
he
will
renew
it
but
who
do
you
think
it
is
cried
neb
who
answered
pencroft
but
he
the
sailors
sentence
was
cut
short
by
a
new
tinkle
of
the
bell
harding
went
to
the
apparatus
and
sent
this
question
to
the
corral
what
do
you
want
a
few
moments
later
the
needle
moving
on
the
alphabetic
dial
gave
this
reply
to
the
tenants
of
granite
house
come
to
the
corral
immediately
at
last
exclaimed
harding
yes
at
last
the
mystery
was
about
to
be
unveiled
the
colonists
fatigue
had
disappeared
before
the
tremendous
interest
which
was
about
to
urge
them
to
the
corral
and
all
wish
for
rest
had
ceased
without
having
uttered
a
word
in
a
few
moments
they
had
left
granite
house
and
were
standing
on
the
beach
jup
and
top
alone
were
left
behind
they
could
do
without
them
the
night
was
black
the
new
moon
had
disappeared
at
the
same
time
as
the
sun
as
herbert
had
observed
great
stormy
clouds
formed
a
lowering
and
heavy
vault
preventing
any
star
rays
a
few
lightning
flashes
reflections
from
a
distant
storm
illuminated
the
horizon
it
was
possible
that
a
few
hours
later
the
thunder
would
roll
over
the
island
itself
the
night
was
very
threatening
but
however
deep
the
darkness
was
it
would
not
prevent
them
from
finding
the
familiar
road
to
the
corral
they
ascended
the
left
bank
of
the
mercy
reached
the
plateau
passed
the
bridge
over
creek
glycerine
and
advanced
through
the
forest
they
walked
at
a
good
pace
a
prey
to
the
liveliest
emotions
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
they
were
now
going
to
learn
the
longsearchedfor
answer
to
the
enigma
the
name
of
that
mysterious
being
so
deeply
concerned
in
their
life
so
generous
in
his
influence
so
powerful
in
his
action
must
not
this
stranger
have
indeed
mingled
with
their
existence
have
known
the
smallest
details
have
heard
all
that
was
said
in
granite
house
to
have
been
able
always
to
act
in
the
very
nick
of
time
every
one
wrapped
up
in
his
own
reflections
pressed
forward
under
the
arch
of
trees
the
darkness
was
such
that
even
the
edge
of
the
road
could
not
be
seen
not
a
sound
in
the
forest
both
animals
and
birds
influenced
by
the
heaviness
of
the
atmosphere
remained
motionless
and
silent
not
a
breath
disturbed
the
leaves
the
footsteps
of
the
colonists
alone
resounded
on
the
hardened
ground
during
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
the
silence
was
only
interrupted
by
this
remark
from
pencroft
we
ought
to
have
brought
a
torch
and
by
this
reply
from
the
engineer
we
shall
find
one
at
the
corral
harding
and
his
companions
had
left
granite
house
at
twelve
minutes
past
nine
at
fortyseven
minutes
past
nine
they
had
traversed
three
out
of
the
five
miles
which
separated
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
from
the
corral
at
that
moment
sheets
of
lightning
spread
over
the
island
and
illumined
the
dark
trees
the
flashes
dazzled
and
almost
blinded
them
evidently
the
storm
would
not
be
long
in
bursting
forth
the
flashes
gradually
became
brighter
and
more
rapid
distant
thunder
growled
in
the
sky
the
atmosphere
was
stifling
the
colonists
proceeded
as
if
they
were
urged
onwards
by
some
irresistible
force
at
ten
oclock
a
vivid
flash
showed
them
the
palisade
and
as
they
reached
the
gate
the
storm
burst
forth
with
tremendous
fury
in
a
minute
the
corral
was
crossed
and
harding
stood
before
the
hut
probably
the
house
was
occupied
by
the
stranger
since
it
was
from
thence
that
the
telegram
had
been
sent
however
no
light
shone
through
the
window
the
engineer
knocked
at
the
door
no
answer
cyrus
harding
opened
the
door
and
the
settlers
entered
the
room
which
was
perfectly
dark
a
light
was
struck
by
neb
and
in
a
few
moments
the
lantern
was
lighted
and
the
light
thrown
into
every
corner
of
the
room
there
was
no
one
there
everything
was
in
the
state
in
which
it
had
been
left
have
we
been
deceived
by
an
illusion
murmured
cyrus
harding
no
that
was
not
possible
the
telegram
had
clearly
said
come
to
the
corral
immediately
they
approached
the
table
specially
devoted
to
the
use
of
the
wire
everything
was
in
orderthe
pile
on
the
box
containing
it
as
well
as
all
the
apparatus
who
came
here
the
last
time
asked
the
engineer
i
did
captain
answered
ayrton
and
that
was
four
days
ago
ah
a
note
cried
herbert
pointing
to
a
paper
lying
on
the
table
on
this
paper
were
written
these
words
in
english
follow
the
new
wire
forward
cried
harding
who
understood
that
the
despatch
had
not
been
sent
from
the
corral
but
from
the
mysterious
retreat
communicating
directly
with
granite
house
by
means
of
a
supplementary
wire
joined
to
the
old
one
neb
took
the
lighted
lantern
and
all
left
the
corral
the
storm
then
burst
forth
with
tremendous
violence
the
interval
between
each
lightningflash
and
each
thunderclap
diminished
rapidly
the
summit
of
the
volcano
with
its
plume
of
vapor
could
be
seen
by
occasional
flashes
there
was
no
telegraphic
communication
in
any
part
of
the
corral
between
the
house
and
the
palisade
but
the
engineer
running
straight
to
the
first
post
saw
by
the
light
of
a
flash
a
new
wire
hanging
from
the
isolator
to
the
ground
there
it
is
said
he
this
wire
lay
along
the
ground
and
was
surrounded
with
an
isolating
substance
like
a
submarine
cable
so
as
to
assure
the
free
transmission
of
the
current
it
appeared
to
pass
through
the
wood
and
the
southern
spurs
of
the
mountain
and
consequently
it
ran
towards
the
west
follow
it
said
cyrus
harding
and
the
settlers
immediately
pressed
forward
guided
by
the
wire
the
thunder
continued
to
roar
with
such
violence
that
not
a
word
could
be
heard
however
there
was
no
occasion
for
speaking
but
to
get
forward
as
fast
as
possible
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
then
climbed
the
spur
rising
between
the
corral
valley
and
that
of
falls
river
which
they
crossed
at
its
narrowest
part
the
wire
sometimes
stretched
over
the
lower
branches
of
the
trees
sometimes
lying
on
the
ground
guided
them
surely
the
engineer
had
supposed
that
the
wire
would
perhaps
stop
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
that
the
strangers
retreat
would
be
there
nothing
of
the
sort
they
were
obliged
to
ascend
the
southwestern
spur
and
redescend
on
that
arid
plateau
terminated
by
the
strangelywild
basalt
cliff
from
time
to
time
one
of
the
colonists
stooped
down
and
felt
for
the
wire
with
his
hands
but
there
was
now
no
doubt
that
the
wire
was
running
directly
towards
the
sea
there
to
a
certainty
in
the
depths
of
those
rocks
was
the
dwelling
so
long
sought
for
in
vain
the
sky
was
literally
on
fire
flash
succeeded
flash
several
struck
the
summit
of
the
volcano
in
the
midst
of
the
thick
smoke
it
appeared
there
as
if
the
mountain
was
vomiting
flame
at
a
few
minutes
to
eleven
the
colonists
arrived
on
the
high
cliff
overlooking
the
ocean
to
the
west
the
wind
had
risen
the
surf
roared
500
feet
below
harding
calculated
that
they
had
gone
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
corral
at
this
point
the
wire
entered
among
the
rocks
following
the
steep
side
of
a
narrow
ravine
the
settlers
followed
it
at
the
risk
of
occasioning
a
fall
of
the
slightlybalanced
rocks
and
being
dashed
into
the
sea
the
descent
was
extremely
perilous
but
they
did
not
think
of
the
danger
they
were
no
longer
masters
of
themselves
and
an
irresistible
attraction
drew
them
towards
this
mysterious
place
as
the
magnet
draws
iron
thus
they
almost
unconsciously
descended
this
ravine
which
even
in
broad
daylight
would
have
been
considered
impracticable
the
stones
rolled
and
sparkled
like
fiery
balls
when
they
crossed
through
the
gleams
of
light
harding
was
firstayrton
last
on
they
went
step
by
step
now
they
slid
over
the
slippery
rock
then
they
struggled
to
their
feet
and
scrambled
on
at
last
the
wire
touched
the
rocks
on
the
beach
the
colonists
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
basalt
cliff
there
appeared
a
narrow
ridge
running
horizontally
and
parallel
with
the
sea
the
settlers
followed
the
wire
along
it
they
had
not
gone
a
hundred
paces
when
the
ridge
by
a
moderate
incline
sloped
down
to
the
level
of
the
sea
the
engineer
seized
the
wire
and
found
that
it
disappeared
beneath
the
waves
his
companions
were
stupefied
a
cry
of
disappointment
almost
a
cry
of
despair
escaped
them
must
they
then
plunge
beneath
the
water
and
seek
there
for
some
submarine
cavern
in
their
excited
state
they
would
not
have
hesitated
to
do
it
the
engineer
stopped
them
he
led
his
companions
to
a
hollow
in
the
rocks
and
there
we
must
wait
said
he
the
tide
is
high
at
low
water
the
way
will
be
open
but
what
can
make
you
think
asked
pencroft
he
would
not
have
called
us
if
the
means
had
been
wanting
to
enable
us
to
reach
him
cyrus
harding
spoke
in
a
tone
of
such
thorough
conviction
that
no
objection
was
raised
his
remark
besides
was
logical
it
was
quite
possible
that
an
opening
practicable
at
low
water
though
hidden
now
by
the
high
tide
opened
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
there
was
some
time
to
wait
the
colonists
remained
silently
crouching
in
a
deep
hollow
rain
now
began
to
fall
in
torrents
the
thunder
was
reechoed
among
the
rocks
with
a
grand
sonorousness
the
colonists
emotion
was
great
a
thousand
strange
and
extraordinary
ideas
crossed
their
brains
and
they
expected
some
grand
and
superhuman
apparition
which
alone
could
come
up
to
the
notion
they
had
formed
of
the
mysterious
genius
of
the
island
at
midnight
harding
carrying
the
lantern
descended
to
the
beach
to
reconnoiter
the
engineer
was
not
mistaken
the
beginning
of
an
immense
excavation
could
be
seen
under
the
water
there
the
wire
bending
at
a
right
angle
entered
the
yawning
gulf
cyrus
harding
returned
to
his
companions
and
said
simply
in
an
hour
the
opening
will
be
practicable
it
is
there
then
said
pencroft
did
you
doubt
it
returned
harding
but
this
cavern
must
be
filled
with
water
to
a
certain
height
observed
herbert
either
the
cavern
will
be
completely
dry
replied
harding
and
in
that
case
we
can
traverse
it
on
foot
or
it
will
not
be
dry
and
some
means
of
transport
will
be
put
at
our
disposal
an
hour
passed
all
climbed
down
through
the
rain
to
the
level
of
the
sea
there
was
now
eight
feet
of
the
opening
above
the
water
it
was
like
the
arch
of
a
bridge
under
which
rushed
the
foaming
water
leaning
forward
the
engineer
saw
a
black
object
floating
on
the
water
he
drew
it
towards
him
it
was
a
boat

the

rose
but
the

slight
for

solemn

exploring

sentences
when
all
at

to

he
commanded
the

altering
its
course
came
up
alongside
the

the

wished
to

urged
the

onwards
on
they
went
for
another

and
a

have
been
cleared
from

when

was
again
heard

said
he
the

stopped
and
the
colonists
perceived
a
bright
light
illuminating
the
vast
cavern
so
deeply
excavated
in
the
bowels
of
the
island
of
which
nothing
had
ever
led
them
to
suspect

the

in

washed
their

the
brilliant
focus
of
light
pointed
out
by
the

every
point

flooded
the

the
brilliant
sparkles

that
the

appeared
to
be
floating
between
two
glittering
zones

could
not
be
mistaken
in
the
nature
of
the
irradiation
thrown
from

glowing
nucleus

clear
rays
were
shattered
by
all
the
angles

this

proceeded
from
an
electric
source

its
white
color
betrayed
its
origin
it
was
the
sun
of

nearly
350

be
seen
an
enormous

cushion
of
the
divan
from
which
he
had
just
risen
he
appeared
perfectly
calm
it
was
evident
that
his
strength
had
been
gradually
undermined
by
illness
but
his
voice
seemed
yet
powerful
as
he
said
in
english
and
in
a
tone
which
evinced
extreme
surprise
sir
i
have
no
name
nevertheless
i
know
you
replied
cyrus
harding
captain
nemo
fixed
his
penetrating
gaze
upon
the
engineer
as
though
he
were
about
to
annihilate
him
then
falling
back
amid
the
pillows
of
the
divan
after
all
what
matters
now
he
murmured
i
am
dying
cyrus
harding
drew
near
the
captain
and

heat
ayrton
pencroft
herbert
and
neb
stood
respectfully
apart
in
an
angle
of
the
magnificent
saloon
whose
atmosphere
was
saturated
with
the
electric
fluid
meanwhile
captain
nemo
withdrew
his
hand
and
motioned
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
to
be
seated
all
regarded
him
with
profound
emotion
before
them
they
beheld
that
being
whom
they
had
styled
the
genius
of
the
island
the
powerful
protector
whose
intervention
in
so
many
circumstances
had
been
so
efficacious
the
benefactor
to
whom
they
owed
such
a
debt
of
gratitude
their
eyes
beheld
a
man
only
and
a
man
at
the
point
of
death
where
pencroft
and
neb
had
expected
to
find
an
almost
supernatural
being
but
how
happened
it
that
cyrus
harding
had
recognized
captain
nemo
why
had
the
latter
so
suddenly
risen
on
hearing
this
name
uttered
a
name
which
he
had
believed
known
to
none
the
captain
had
resumed
his
position
on
the
divan
and
leaning
on
his
arm
he
regarded
the
engineer
seated
near
him
you
know
the
name
i
formerly
bore
sir
he
asked
i
do
answered
cyrus
harding
and
also
that
of
this
wonderful
submarine
vessel
the
nautilus
said
the
captain
with
a
faint
smile
the
nautilus
but
do
youdo
you
know
who
i
am
i
do
it
is
nevertheless
many
years
since
i
have
held
any
communication
with
the
inhabited
world
three
long
years
have
i
passed
in
the
depth
of
the
sea
the
only
place
where
i
have
found
liberty
who
then
can
have
betrayed
my
secret
a
man
who
was
bound
to
you
by
no
tie
captain
nemo
and
who
consequently
cannot
be
accused
of
treachery
the
frenchman
who
was
cast
on
board
my
vessel
by
chance
sixteen
years
since
the
same
he
and
his
two
companions
did
not
then
perish
in
the
maelstrom
in
the
midst
of
which
the
nautilus
was
struggling
they
escaped
and
a
book
has
appeared
under
the
title
of
twenty
thousand
leagues
under
the
sea
which
contains
your
history
the
history
of
a
few
months
only
of
my
life
interrupted
the
captain
impetuously
it
is
true
answered
cyrus
harding
but
a
few
months
of
that
strange
life
have
sufficed
to
make
you
known
as
a
great
criminal
doubtless
said
captain
nemo
a
haughty
smile
curling
his
lips
yes
a
rebel
perhaps
an
outlaw
against
humanity
the
engineer
was
silent
well
sir
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
you
captain
nemo
answered
cyrus
harding
at
any
rate
as
regards
your
past
life
i
am
with
the
rest
of
the
world
ignorant
of
the
motives
which
induced
you
to
adopt
this
strange
mode
of
existence
and
i
cannot
judge
of
effects
without
knowing
their
causes
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
a
beneficent
hand
has
constantly
protected
us
since
our
arrival
on
lincoln
island
that
we
all
owe
our
lives
to
a
good
generous
and
powerful
being
and
that
this
being
so
powerful
good
and
generous
captain
nemo
is
yourself
it
is
i
answered
the
captain
simply
the
engineer
and
the
reporter
rose
their
companions
had
drawn
near
and
the
gratitude
with
which
their
hearts
were
charged
was
about
to
express
itself
in
their
gestures
and
words
captain
nemo
stopped
them
by
a
sign
and
in
a
voice
which
betrayed
more
emotion
than
he
doubtless
intended
to
show
wait
till
you
have
heard
all
he
said
and
the
captain
in
a
few
concise
sentences
ran
over
the
events
of
his
life
his
narrative
was
short
yet
he
was
obliged
to
summon
up
his
whole
remaining
energy
to
arrive
at
the
end
he
was
evidently
contending
against
extreme
weakness
several
times
cyrus
harding
entreated
him
to
repose
for
a
while
but
he
shook
his
head
as
a
man
to
whom
the
morrow
may
never
come
and
when
the
reporter
offered
his
assistance
it
is
useless
he
said
my
hours
are
numbered
captain
nemo
was
an
indian
the
prince
dakkar
son
of
a
rajah
of
the
then
independent
territory
of
bundelkund
his
father
sent
him
when
ten
years
of
age
to
europe
in
order
that
he
might
receive
an
education
in
all
respects
complete
and
in
the
hopes
that
by
his
talents
and
knowledge
he
might
one
day
take
a
leading
part
in
raising
his
long
degraded
and
heathen
country
to
a
level
with
the
nations
of
europe
from
the
age
of
ten

to
that
of
thirty

dakkar
endowed
by
nature
with
her
richest
gifts
of
intellect
accumulated
knowledge
of
every
kind
and
in
science
literature

art
his
researches
were
extensive
and
profound
he
traveled
over
the
whole
of
europe
his
rank
and
fortune
caused
him
to
be
everywhere
sought
after
but
the
pleasures
of
the
world
had
for
him
no
attractions
though
young
and
possessed
of
every
personal
advantage
he
was
ever
gravesomber
evendevoured
by
an
unquenchable
thirst
for
knowledge
and
cherishing
in
the
recesses
of
his
heart

hope
that
he
might
become
a
great
and
powerful
ruler
of
a
free
and
enlightened
people
still
for
long
the
love
of
science
triumphed
over
all
other
feelings
he
became
an
artist
deeply
impressed
by
the
marvels
of
art
a
philosopher
to
whom
no
one
of
the
higher
sciences
was
unknown
a
statesman
versed
in
the
policy
of
european
courts
to
the
eyes
of
those
who
observed
him
superficially
he
might
have
passed
for
one
of
those
cosmopolitans
curious
of
knowledge

disdaining
action
one
of

who

are

history
of

in

been
published
under
the
title
of
twenty
thousand

therefore
will
apply
the
observation
already

to
the
adventures
of

to
the

his
earliest
days
prince
dakkar
returned
to
bundelkund
in
the
year
1849
he
married
a
noble
indian
lady
who
was
imbued
with
an
ambition
not
less
ardent
than
that
by
which
he
was
inspired
two
children
were
born
to
them
whom
they
tenderly
loved
but
domestic
happiness
did
not
prevent
him
from
seeking
to
carry
out
the
object
at
which
he
aimed
he
waited
an
opportunity
at
length
as
he
vainly
fancied
it
presented
itself
instigated
by
princes
equally
ambitious
and
less
sagacious
and
more
unscrupulous
than
he
was
the
people
of
india
were
persuaded
that
they
might
successfully
rise
against
their
english
rulers
who
had
brought
them
out
of
a
state
of
anarchy
and
constant
warfare
and
misery
and
had
established
peace
and
prosperity
in
their
country
their
ignorance
and
gross
superstition
made
them
the
facile
tools
of
their
designing
chiefs
in
1857
the
great
sepoy
revolt
broke
out
prince
dakkar
under
the
belief
that
he
should
thereby
have
the
opportunity
of
attaining
the
object
of
his
longcherished
ambition
was
easily
drawn
into
it
he
forthwith
devoted
his
talents
and
wealth
to
the
service
of
this
cause
he
aided
it
in
person
he
fought
in
the
front
ranks
he
risked
his
life
equally
with
the
humblest
of
the
wretched
and
misguided
fanatics
he
was
ten
times
wounded
in
twenty
engagements
seeking
death
but
finding
it
not
but
at
length
the
sanguinary
rebels
were
utterly
defeated
and
the
atrocious
mutiny
was
brought
to
an
end
never
before
had
the
british
power
in
india
been
exposed
to
such
danger
and
if
as
they
had
hoped
the
sepoys
had
received
assistance
from
without
the
influence
and
supremacy
in
asia
of
the
united
kingdom
would
have
been
a
thing
of
the
past
the
name
of

dakkar
was
at
that
time
well
known
he
had
fought
openly
and
without
concealment
a
price
was
set
upon
his
head
but
he
managed
to
escape
from
his
pursuers
civilization

it
onwards
the
sepoys
were
vanquished
and
the
land

to

of
bundelkund
there
alone
in
the
world
overcome
by
disappointment
at
the
destruction
of
all
his
vain
hopes
a
prey
to
profound
disgust
for
all
human
beings
filled
with
hatred
of
the
civilized
world
he
realized
the
wreck
of
his
fortune
assembled
some
score
of
his
most
faithful
companions
and
one
day
disappeared
leaving
no
trace
behind
where
then
did
he
seek
that
liberty
denied
him
upon
the
inhabited
earth
under
the
waves
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean

none
could
follow
the
warrior

the
man
of
science
upon
a
deserted
island
of
the
pacific
he
established
his
dockyard
and
there
a
submarine
vessel
was
constructed
from
his
designs
by
methods
which
will
at
some
future
day
be
revealed
he
had
rendered
subservient
the
illimitable
forces
of
electricity
which
extracted
from
inexhaustible
sources
was
employed
for
all
the
requirements
of
his
floating
equipage
as
a
moving

and
heating
agent
the

with
its
countless
treasures
its
myriads
of

its
numberless
wrecks
its
enormous
mammalia

not
only
all
that
nature
supplied
but
also
all
that
man
had
lost
in
its
depths
sufficed
for
every
want
of
the
prince
and
his
crewand
thus
was
his
most
ardent
desire
accomplished
never
again
to
hold
communication
with
the
earth
he
named
his
submarine
vessel
the
nautilus
called
himself
simply
captain
nemo
and
disappeared
beneath
the
seas
during
many
years
this
strange
being
visited
every
ocean
from
pole
to
pole
outcast
of
the
inhabited
earth
in
these
unknown
worlds
he
gathered
incalculable
treasures
the
millions
lost
in
the
bay
of
vigo
in
1702
by
the
galleons
of
spain
furnished
him
with
a
mine
of
inexhaustible
riches
which
he
devoted
always
anonymously
in
favor
of
those
nations
who
fought
for
the
independence
of
their
country
this
refers
to
the
resurrection
of
the
candiotes
who
were
in
fact
largely
assisted
by
captain
nemo
for
long
however
he
had
held
no
communication
with
his
fellowcreatures
when
during
the
night
of
the
6th
of
november
1866
three
men
were
cast
on
board
his
vessel
they
were
a
french
professor
his
servant
and
a
canadian
fisherman
these
three
men
had
been
hurled
overboard
by
a
collision
which
had
taken
place
between
the
nautilus
and
the
united
states
frigate
abraham
lincoln
which
had
chased
her
captain
nemo
learned
from
this
professor
that
the
nautilus
taken
now
for
a
gigantic
mammal
of
the
whale
species
now
for
a
submarine
vessel
carrying
a
crew
of
pirates
was
sought
for
in
every
sea
he
might
have
returned
these
three
men
to
the
ocean
from
whence
chance
had
brought
them
in
contact
with
his
mysterious
existence
instead
of
doing
this
he
kept
them
prisoners
and
during
seven
months
they
were
enabled
to
behold
all
the
wonders
of
a
voyage
of
twenty
thousand
leagues
under
the
sea
one
day
the
22nd
of
june
1867
these
three
men
who
knew
nothing
of
the
past
history
of
captain
nemo
succeeded
in
escaping
in
one
of
the
nautiluss
boats
but
as
at
this
time
the
nautilus
was
drawn
into
the
vortex
of
the
maelstrom
off
the
coast
of
norway
the
captain
naturally
believed
that
the
fugitives
engulfed
in
that
frightful
whirlpool
found
their
death
at
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
he
was
unaware
that
the
frenchman
and
his
two
companions
had
been
miraculously
cast
on
shore
that
the
fishermen
of
the
lofoten
islands
had
rendered
them
assistance
and
that
the
professor
on
his
return
to
france
had
published
that
work
in
which
seven
months
of
the
strange
and
eventful
navigation
of
the
nautilus
were
narrated
and
exposed
to
the
curiosity
of
the
public
for
a
long
time
after
this
captain
nemo
continued
to
live
thus
traversing
every
sea
but
one
by
one
his
companions
died
and
found
their
last
restingplace
in
their
cemetery
of
coral
in
the
bed
of
the
pacific
at
last
captain
nemo
remained
the
solitary
survivor
of
all
those
who
had
taken
refuge
with
him
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
he
was
now
sixty
years
of
age
although
alone
he
succeeded
in
navigating
the
nautilus
towards
one
of
those
submarine
caverns
which
had
sometimes
served
him
as
a
harbor
one
of
these
ports
was
hollowed
beneath
lincoln
island
and
at
this
moment
furnished
an
asylum
to
the
nautilus
the
captain
had
now
remained
there
six
years
navigating
the
ocean
no
longer
but
awaiting
death
and
that
moment
when
he
should
rejoin
his
former
companions
when
by
chance
he
observed
the
descent
of
the
balloon
which
carried
the
prisoners
of
the
confederates
clad
in
his
diving
dress
he
was
walking
beneath
the
water
at
a
few
cables
length
from
the
shore
of
the
island
when
the
engineer
had
been
thrown
into
the
sea
moved
by
a
feeling
of
compassion
the
captain
saved
cyrus
harding
his
first
impulse
was
to
fly
from
the
vicinity
of
the
five
castaways
but
his
harbor
refuge
was
closed
for
in
consequence
of
an
elevation
of
the
basalt
produced
by
the
influence
of
volcanic
action
he
could
no
longer
pass
through
the
entrance
of
the
vault
though
there
was
sufficient
depth
of
water
to
allow
a
light
craft
to
pass
the
bar
there
was
not
enough
for
the
nautilus
whose
draught
of
water
was
considerable
captain
nemo
was
compelled
therefore
to
remain
he
observed
these
men
thrown
without
resources
upon
a
desert
island
but
had
no
wish
to
be
himself
discovered
by
them
by
degrees
he
became
interested
in
their
efforts
when
he
saw
them
honest
energetic
and
bound
to
each
other
by
the
ties
of
friendship
as
if
despite
his
wishes
he
penetrated
all
the
secrets
of
their
existence
by
means
of
the
diving
dress
he
could
easily
reach
the
well
in
the
interior
of
granite
house
and
climbing
by
the
projections
of
rock
to
its
upper
orifice
he
heard
the
colonists
as
they
recounted
the
past
and
studied
the
present
and
future
he
learned
from
them
the
tremendous
conflict
of
america
with
america
itself
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
yes
these
men
were
worthy
to
reconcile
captain
nemo
with
that
humanity
which
they
represented
so
nobly
in
the
island
captain
nemo
had
saved
cyrus
harding
it
was
he
also
who
had
brought
back
the
dog
to
the
chimneys
who
rescued
top
from
the
waters
of
the
lake
who
caused
to
fall
at
flotsam
point
the
case
containing
so
many
things
useful
to
the
colonists
who
conveyed
the
canoe
back
into
the
stream
of
the
mercy
who
cast
the
cord
from
the
top
of
granite
house
at
the
time
of
the
attack
by
the
baboons
who
made
known
the
presence
of
ayrton
upon
tabor
island
by
means
of
the
document
enclosed
in
the
bottle
who
caused
the
explosion
of
the
brig
by
the
shock
of
a
torpedo
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
canal
who
saved
herbert
from
certain
death
by
bringing
the
sulphate
of
quinine
and
finally
it
was
he
who
had
killed
the
convicts
with
the
electric
balls
of
which
he
possessed
the
secret
and
which
he
employed
in
the
chase
of
submarine
creatures
thus
were
explained
so
many
apparently
supernatural
occurrences
and
which
all
proved
the
generosity
and
power
of
the
captain
nevertheless
this
noble
misanthrope
longed
to
benefit
his
proteges
still
further
there
yet
remained
much
useful
advice
to
give
them
and
his
heart
being
softened
by
the
approach
of
death
he
invited
as
we
are
aware
the
colonists
of
granite
house
to
visit
the
nautilus
by
means
of
a
wire
which
connected
it
with
the
corral
possibly
he
would
not
have
done
this
had
he
been
aware
that
cyrus
harding
was
sufficiently
acquainted
with
his
history
to
address
him
by
the
name
of
nemo
the
captain
concluded
the
narrative
of
his
life
cyrus
harding
then
spoke
he
recalled
all
the
incidents
which
had
exercised
so
beneficent
an
influence
upon
the
colony
and
in
the
names
of
his
companions
and
himself
thanked
the
generous
being
to
whom
they
owed
so
much
but
captain
nemo
paid
little
attention
his
mind
appeared
to
be
absorbed
by
one
idea
and
without
taking
the
proffered
hand
of
the
engineer
now
sir
said
he
now
that
you
know
my
history
your
judgment
in
saying
this
the
captain
evidently
alluded
to
an
important
incident
witnessed
by
the
three
strangers
thrown
on
board
his
vessel
and
which
the
french
professor
had
related
in
his
work
causing
a
profound
and
terrible
sensation
some
days
previous
to
the
flight
of
the
professor
and
his
two
companions
the
nautilus
being
chased
by
a
frigate
in
the
north
of
the
atlantic
had
hurled
herself
as
a
ram
upon
this
frigate
and
sunk
her
without
mercy
cyrus
harding
understood
the
captains
allusion
and
was
silent
it
was
an
enemys
frigate
exclaimed
captain
nemo
transformed
for
an
instant
into
the
prince
dakkar
an
enemys
frigate
it
was

who
attacked

in
a

and
shallow
baythe
frigate
barred
my
wayand
i
sank
her
a
few
moments
of
silence
ensued
then
the
captain
demanded
what
think
you
of
my
life
gentlemen
cyrus
harding
extended
his
hand
to
the
cidevant
prince
and
replied
gravely
sir
your
error
was
in
supposing
that
the
past
can
be
resuscitated
and
in
contending
against
inevitable
progress
it
is
one
of
those
errors
which
some
admire
others
blame
which
god
alone
can
judge
he
who
is
mistaken
in
an
action
which
he
sincerely
believes
to
be
right
may
be
an
enemy
but
retains
our
esteem
your
error
is
one
that
we
may
admire
and
your
name
has
nothing
to
fear
from
the
judgment
of
history
which
does
not
condemn
heroic
folly
but
its
results
the
old
mans
breast
swelled
with
emotion
and
raising
his
hand
to
heaven
was
i
wrong
or
in
the
right
he
murmured
cyrus
harding
replied
all
great
actions
return
to
god
from
whom
they
are
derived
captain
nemo
we
whom
you
have
succored
shall
ever
mourn
your
loss
herbert
who
had
drawn
near
the
captain
fell
on
his
knees
and
kissed
his
hand
a
tear
glistened
in
the
eyes
of
the

17
day
had
returned
no
ray
of
light
penetrated
into
the
profundity
of
the
cavern
it
being
highwater
the
entrance
was
closed
by
the
sea
but
the
artificial
light
which
escaped
in
long
streams
from
the
skylights
of
the
nautilus
was
as
vivid
as
before
and
the
sheet
of
water
shone
around
the
floating
vessel
an
extreme
exhaustion
now
overcame
captain
nemo
who
had
fallen
back
upon
the
divan
it
was
useless
to
contemplate
removing
him
to
granite
house
for
he
had
expressed
his
wish
to
remain
in
the
midst
of
those
marvels
of
the
nautilus
which
millions
could
not
have
purchased
and
to
wait
there
for
that
death
which
was
swiftly
approaching
during
a
long
interval
of
prostration
which
rendered
him
almost
unconscious
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
attentively
observed
the
condition
of
the
dying
man
it
was
apparent
that
his
strength
was
gradually
diminishing
that
frame
once
so
robust
was
now
but
the
fragile
tenement
of
a
departing
soul
all
of
life
was
concentrated
in
the
heart
and
head
the
engineer
and
reporter
consulted
in
whispers
was
it
possible
to
render
any
aid
to
the
dying
man
might
his
life
if
not
saved
be
prolonged
for
some
days
he
himself
had
said
that
no
remedy
could
avail
and
he
awaited
with
tranquillity
that
death
which
had
for
him
no
terrors
we
can
do
nothing
said
gideon
spilett
but
of
what
is
he
dying
asked
pencroft
life
is
simply
fading
out
replied
the
reporter
nevertheless
said
the
sailor
if
we
move
him
into
the
open
air
and
the
light
of
the
sun
he
might
perhaps
recover
no
pencroft
answered
the
engineer
it
is
useless
to
attempt
it
besides
captain
nemo
would
never
consent
to
leave
his
vessel
he
has
lived
for
a
dozen
years
on
board
the
nautilus
and
on
board
the
nautilus
he
desires
to
die
without
doubt
captain
nemo
heard
cyrus
hardings
reply
for
he
raised
himself
slightly
and
in
a
voice
more
feeble
but
always
intelligible
you
are
right
sir
he
said
i
shall
die
hereit
is
my
wish
and
therefore
i
have
a
request
to
make
of
you
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
had
drawn
near
the
divan
and
now
arranged
the
cushions
in
such
a
manner
as
to
better
support
the
dying
man
they
saw
his
eyes
wander
over
all
the
marvels
of
this
saloon
lighted
by
the
electric
rays
which
fell
from
the
arabesques
of
the
luminous
ceiling
he
surveyed
one
after
the
other
the
pictures
hanging
from
the
splendid
tapestries
of
the
partitions
the
chefdoeuvres
of
the
italian
flemish
french
and
spanish
masters
the
statues
of
marble
and
bronze
on
their
pedestals
the
magnificent
organ
leaning
against
the
afterpartition
the
aquarium
in
which
bloomed
the
most
wonderful
productions
of
the
seamarine
plants
zoophytes
chaplets
of
pearls
of
inestimable
value
and
finally
his
eyes
rested
on
this
device
inscribed
over
the
pediment
of
the
museumthe
motto
of
the
nautilus
mobilis
in
mobile
his
glance
seemed
to
rest
fondly
for
the
last
time
on
these
masterpieces
of
art
and
of
nature
to
which
he
had
limited
his
horizon
during
a
sojourn
of
so
many
years
in
the
abysses
of
the
seas
cyrus
harding
respected
the
captains
silence
and
waited
till
he
should
speak
after
some
minutes
during
which
doubtless
he
passed
in
review
his
whole
life
captain
nemo
turned
to
the
colonists
and
said
you
consider
yourselves
gentlemen
under
some
obligations
to
me
captain
believe
us
that
we
would
give
our
lives
to
prolong
yours
promise
then
continued
captain
nemo
to
carry
out
my
last
wishes
and
i
shall
be
repaid
for
all
i
have
done
for
you
we
promise
said
cyrus
harding
and
by
this
promise
he
bound
both
himself
and
his
companions
gentlemen
resumed
the
captain
tomorrow
i
shall
be
dead
herbert
was
about
to
utter
an
exclamation
but
a
sign
from
the
captain
arrested
him
tomorrow
i
shall
die
and
i
desire
no
other
tomb
than
the
nautilus
it
is
my
grave
all
my
friends
repose
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
their
restingplace
shall
be
mine
these
words
were
received
with
profound
silence
pay
attention
to
my
wishes
he
continued
the
nautilus
is
imprisoned
in
this
grotto
the
entrance
of
which
is
blocked
up
but
although
egress
is
impossible
the
vessel
may
at
least
sink
in
the
abyss
and
there
bury
my
remains
the
colonists
listened
reverently
to
the
words
of
the
dying
man
tomorrow
after
my
death
mr
harding
continued
the
captain
yourself
and
companions
will
leave
the
nautilus
for
all
the
treasures
it
contains
must
perish
with
me
one
token
alone
will
remain
with
you
of
prince
dakkar
with
whose
history
you
are
now
acquainted
that
coffer
yonder
contains
diamonds
of
the
value
of
many
millions
most
of
them
mementoes
of
the
time
when
husband
and
father
i
thought
happiness
possible
for
me
and
a
collection
of
pearls
gathered
by
my
friends
and
myself
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
of
this
treasure
at
a
future
day
you
may
make
good
use
in
the
hands
of
such
men
as
yourself
and
your
comrades
captain
harding
money
will
never
be
a
source
of
danger
from
on
high
i
shall
still
participate
in
your
enterprises
and
i
fear
not
but
that
they
will
prosper
after
a
few
moments
repose
necessitated
by
his
extreme
weakness
captain
nemo
continued
tomorrow
you
will
take
the
coffer
you
will
leave
the
saloon
of
which
you
will
close
the
door
then
you
will
ascend
on
to
the
deck
of
the
nautilus
and
you
will
lower
the
mainhatch
so
as
entirely
to
close
the
vessel
it
shall
be
done
captain
answered
cyrus
harding
good
you
will
then
embark
in
the
canoe
which
brought
you
hither
but
before
leaving
the
nautilus
go
to
the
stern
and
there
open
two
large
stopcocks
which
you
will
find
upon
the
waterline
the
water
will
penetrate
into
the
reservoirs
and
the
nautilus
will
gradually
sink
beneath
the
water
to
repose
at
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
and
comprehending
a
gesture
of
cyrus
harding
the
captain
added
fear
nothing
you
will
but
bury
a
corpse
neither
cyrus
harding
nor
his
companions
ventured
to
offer
any
observation
to
captain
nemo
he
had
expressed
his
last
wishes
and
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
conform
to
them
i
have
your
promise
gentlemen
added
captain
nemo
you
have
captain
replied
the
engineer
the
captain
thanked
the
colonists
by
a
sign
and
requested
them
to
leave
him
for
some
hours
gideon
spilett
wished
to
remain
near
him
in
the
event
of
a
crisis
coming
on
but
the
dying
man
refused
saying
i
shall
live
until
tomorrow
sir
all
left
the
saloon
passed
through
the
library
and
the
diningroom
and
arrived
forward
in
the
machineroom
where
the
electrical
apparatus
was
established
which
supplied
not
only
heat
and
light
but
the
mechanical
power
of
the
nautilus
the
nautilus
was
a
masterpiece
containing
masterpieces
within
itself
and
the
engineer
was
struck
with
astonishment
the
colonists
mounted
the
platform
which
rose
seven
or
eight
feet
above
the
water
there
they
beheld
a
thick
glass
lenticular
covering
which
protected
a
kind
of
large
eye
from
which
flashed
forth
light
behind
this
eye
was
apparently
a
cabin
containing
the
wheels
of
the
rudder
and
in
which
was
stationed
the
helmsman
when
he
navigated
the
nautilus
over
the
bed
of
the
ocean
which
the
electric
rays
would
evidently
light
up
to
a
considerable
distance
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
remained
for
a
time
silent
for
they
were
vividly
impressed
by
what
they
had
just
seen
and
heard
and
their
hearts
were
deeply
touched
by
the
thought
that
he
whose
arm
had
so
often
aided
them
the
protector
whom
they
had
known
but
a
few
hours
was
at
the
point
of
death
whatever
might
be
the
judgment
pronounced
by
posterity
upon
the
events
of
this
so
to
speak
extrahuman
existence
the
character
of
prince
dakkar
would
ever
remain
as
one
of
those
whose
memory
time
can
never
efface
what
a
man
said
pencroft
is
it
possible
that
he
can
have
lived
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
he
has
not
found
peace
there
any
more
than
elsewhere
the
nautilus
observed
ayrton
might
have
enabled
us
to
leave
lincoln
island
and
reach
some
inhabited
country
good
heavens
exclaimed
pencroft
i
for
one
would
never
risk
myself
in
such
a
craft
to
sail
on
the
seas
good
but
under
the
seas
never
i
believe
pencroft
answered
the
reporter
that
the
navigation
of
a
submarine
vessel
such
as
the
nautilus
ought
to
be
very
easy
and
that
we
should
soon
become
accustomed
to
it
there
would
be
no
storms
no
leeshore
to
fear
at
some
feet
beneath
the
surface
the
waters
of
the
ocean
are
as
calm
as
those
of
a
lake
that
may
be
replied
the
sailor
but
i
prefer
a
gale
of
wind
on
board
a
wellfound
craft
a
vessel
is
built
to
sail
on
the
sea
and
not
beneath
it
my
friends
said
the
engineer
it
is
useless
at
any
rate
as
regards
the
nautilus
to
discuss
the
question
of
submarine
vessels
the
nautilus
is
not
ours
and
we
have
not
the
right
to
dispose
of
it
moreover
we
could
in
no
case
avail
ourselves
of
it
independently
of
the
fact
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
it
out
of
this
cavern
whose
entrance
is
now
closed
by
the
uprising
of
the
basaltic
rocks
captain
nemos
wish
is
that
it
shall
be
buried
with
him
his
wish
is
our
law
and
we
will
fulfil
it
after
a
somewhat
prolonged
conversation
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
again
descended
to
the
interior
of
the
nautilus
there
they
took
some
refreshment
and
returned
to
the
saloon
captain
nemo
had
somewhat
rallied
from
the
prostration
which
had
overcome
him
and
his
eyes
shone
with
their
wonted
fire
a
faint
smile
even
curled
his
lips
the
colonists
drew
around
him
gentlemen
said
the
captain
you
are
brave
and
honest
men
you
have
devoted
yourselves
to
the
common
weal
often
have
i
observed
your
conduct
i
have
esteemed
youi
esteem
you
still
your
hand
mr
harding
cyrus
harding
gave
his
hand
to
the
captain
who
clasped
it
affectionately
it
is
well
he
murmured
he
resumed
but
enough
of
myself
i
have
to
speak
concerning
yourselves
and
this
lincoln
island
upon
which
you
have
taken
refuge
you
now
desire
to
leave
it
to
return
captain
answered
pencroft
quickly
to
return
pencroft
said
the
captain
with
a
smile
i
know
it
is
true
your
love
for
this
island
you
have
helped
to
make
it
what
it
now
is
and
it
seems
to
you
a
paradise
our
project
captain
interposed
cyrus
harding
is
to
annex
it
to
the
united
states
and
to
establish
for
our
shipping
a
port
so
fortunately
situated
in
this
part
of
the
pacific
your
thoughts
are
with
your
country
gentlemen
continued
the
captain
your
toils
are
for
her
prosperity
and
glory
you
are
right
ones
native
landthere
should
one
live
there
die
and
i
die
far
from
all
i
loved
you
have
some
last
wish
to
transmit
said
the
engineer
with
emotion
some
souvenir
to
send
to
those
friends
you
have
left
in
the
mountains
of
india
no
captain
harding
no
friends
remain
to
me
i
am
the
last
of
my
race
and
to
all
whom
i
have
known
i
have
long
been
as
are
the
deadbut
to
return
to
yourselves
solitude
isolation
are
painful
things
and
beyond
human
endurance
i
die
of
having
thought
it
possible
to
live
alone
you
should
therefore
dare
all
in
the
attempt
to
leave
lincoln
island
and
see
once
more
the
land
of
your
birth
i
am
aware
that
those
wretches
have
destroyed
the
vessel
you
have
built
we
propose
to
construct
a
vessel
said
gideon
spilett
sufficiently
large
to
convey
us
to
the
nearest
land
but
if
we
should
succeed
sooner
or
later
we
shall
return
to
lincoln
island
we
are
attached
to
it
by
too
many
recollections
ever
to
forget
it
it
is
here
that
we
have
known
captain
nemo
said
cyrus
harding
it
is
here
only
that
we
can
make
our
home
added
herbert
and
here
shall
i
sleep
the
sleep
of
eternity
if
replied
the
captain
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
instead
of
completing
the
sentence
said
simply
mr
harding
i
wish
to
speak
with
youalone
the
engineers
companions
respecting
the
wish
retired
cyrus
harding
remained
but
a
few
minutes
alone
with
captain
nemo
and
soon
recalled
his
companions
but
he
said
nothing
to
them
of
the
private
matters
which
the
dying
man
had
confided
to
him
gideon
spilett
now
watched
the
captain
with
extreme
care
it
was
evident
that
he
was
no
longer
sustained
by
his
moral
energy
which
had
lost
the
power
of
reaction
against
his
physical
weakness
the
day
closed
without
change
the
colonists
did
not
quit
the
nautilus
for
a
moment
night
arrived
although
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
it
from
day
in
the
cavern
captain
nemo
suffered
no
pain
but
he
was
visibly
sinking
his
noble
features
paled
by
the
approach
of
death
were
perfectly
calm
inaudible
words
escaped
at
intervals
from
his
lips
bearing
upon
various
incidents
of
his
checkered
career
life
was
evidently
ebbing
slowly
and
his
extremities
were
already
cold
once
or
twice
more
he
spoke
to
the
colonists
who
stood
around
him
and
smiled
on
them
with
that
last
smile
which
continues
after
death
at
length
shortly
after
midnight
captain
nemo
by
a
supreme
effort
succeeded
in
folding
his
arms
across
his
breast
as
if
wishing
in
that
attitude
to
compose
himself
for
death
by
one
oclock
his
glance
alone
showed
signs
of
life
a
dying
light
gleamed
in
those
eyes
once
so
brilliant
then
murmuring
the
words
god
and
my
country
he
quietly
expired
cyrus
harding
bending
low
closed
the
eyes
of
him
who
had
once
been
the
prince
dakkar
and
was
now
not
even
captain
nemo
herbert
and
pencroft
sobbed
aloud
tears
fell
from
ayrtons
eyes
neb
was
on
his
knees
by
the
reporters
side
motionless
as
a
statue
then
cyrus
harding
extending
his
hand
over
the
forehead
of
the
dead
said
solemnly
may
his
soul
be
with
god
turning
to
his
friends
he
added
let
us
pray
for
him
whom
we
have
lost
some
hours
later
the
colonists
fulfilled
the
promise
made
to
the
captain
by
carrying
out
his
dying
wishes
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
quitted
the
nautilus
taking
with
them
the
only
memento
left
them
by
their
benefactor
the
coffer
which
contained
wealth
amounting
to
millions
the
marvelous
saloon
still
flooded
with
light
had
been
carefully
closed
the
iron
door
leading
on
deck
was
then
securely
fastened
in
such
a
manner
as
to
prevent
even
a
drop
of
water
from
penetrating
to
the
interior
of
the
nautilus
the
colonists
then
descended
into
the
canoe
which
was
moored
to
the
side
of
the
submarine
vessel
the
canoe
was
now
brought
around
to
the
stern
there
at
the
waterline
were
two
large
stopcocks
communicating
with
the
reservoirs
employed
in
the
submersion
of
the
vessel
the
stopcocks
were
opened
the
reservoirs
filled
and
the
nautilus
slowly
sinking
disappeared
beneath
the
surface
of
the
lake
but
the
colonists
were
yet
able
to
follow
its
descent
through
the
waves
the
powerful
light
it
gave
forth
lighted
up
the
translucent
water
while
the
cavern
became
gradually
obscure
at
length
this
vast
effusion
of
electric
light
faded
away
and
soon
after
the
nautilus
now
the
tomb
of
captain
nemo
reposed
in
its
ocean
bed
chapter

at
break
of
day
the
colonists
regained
in
silence
the
entrance
of
the
cavern
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
dakkar
grotto
in
memory
of
captain
nemo
it
was
now
lowwater
and
they
passed
without
difficulty
under
the
arcade
washed
on
the
right
by
the
sea
the
canoe
was
left
here
carefully
protected
from
the
waves
as
additional
precaution
pencroft
neb
and
ayrton
drew
it
up
on
a
little
beach
which
bordered
one
of
the
sides
of
the
grotto
in
a
spot
where
it
could
run
no
risk
of
harm
the
storm
had
ceased
during
the
night
the
last
low
mutterings
of
the
thunder
died
away
in
the
west
rain
fell
no
longer
but
the
sky
was
yet
obscured
by
clouds
on
the
whole
this
month
of
october
the
first
of
the
southern
spring
was
not
ushered
in
by
satisfactory
tokens
and
the
wind
had
a
tendency
to
shift
from
one
point
of
the
compass
to
another
which
rendered
it
impossible
to
count
upon
settled
weather
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
on
leaving
dakkar
grotto
had
taken
the
road
to
the
corral
on
their
way
neb
and
herbert
were
careful
to
preserve
the
wire
which
had
been
laid
down
by
the
captain
between
the
corral
and
the
grotto
and
which
might
at
a
future
time
be
of
service
the
colonists
spoke
but
little
on
the
road
the
various
incidents
of
the
night
of
october
15th
had
left
a
profound
impression
on
their
minds
the
unknown
being
whose
influence
had
so
effectually
protected
them
the
man
whom
their
imagination
had
endowed
with
supernatural
powers
captain
nemo
was
no
more
his
nautilus
and
he
were
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
abyss
to
each
one
of
them
their
existence
seemed
even
more
isolated
than
before
they
had
been
accustomed
to
count
upon
the
intervention
of
that
power
which
existed
no
longer
and
gideon
spilett
and
even
cyrus
harding
could
not
escape
this
impression
thus
they
maintained
a
profound
silence
during
their
journey
to
the
corral
towards
nine
in
the
morning
the
colonists
arrived
at
granite
house
it
had
been
agreed
that
the
construction
of
the
vessel
should
be
actively
pushed
forward
and
cyrus
harding
more
than
ever
devoted
his
time
and
labor
to
this
object
it
was
impossible
to
divine
what
future
lay
before
them
evidently
the
advantage
to
the
colonists
would
be
great
of
having
at
their
disposal
a
substantial
vessel
capable
of
keeping
the
sea
even
in
heavy
weather
and
large
enough
to
attempt
in
case
of
need
a
voyage
of
some
duration
even
if
when
their
vessel
should
be
completed
the
colonists
should
not
resolve
to
leave
lincoln
island
as
yet
in
order
to
gain
either
one
of
the
polynesian
archipelagoes
of
the
pacific
or
the
shores
of
new
zealand
they
might
at
least
sooner
or
later
proceed
to
tabor
island
to
leave
there
the
notice
relating
to
ayrton
this
was
a
precaution
rendered
indispensable
by
the
possibility
of
the
scotch
yacht
reappearing
in
those
seas
and
it
was
of
the
highest
importance
that
nothing
should
be
neglected
on
this
point
the
works
were
then
resumed
cyrus
harding
pencroft
and
ayrton
assisted
by
neb
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
except
when
unavoidably
called
off
by
other
necessary
occupations
worked
without
cessation
it
was
important
that
the
new
vessel
should
be
ready
in
five
monthsthat
is
to
say
by
the
beginning
of
marchif
they
wished
to
visit
tabor
island
before
the
equinoctial
gales
rendered
the
voyage
impracticable
therefore
the
carpenters
lost
not
a
moment
moreover
it
was
unnecessary
to
manufacture
rigging
that
of
the
speedy
having
been
saved
entire
so
that
the
hull
only
of
the
vessel
needed
to
be
constructed
the
end
of
the
year
1868
found
them
occupied
by
these
important
labors
to
the
exclusion
of
almost
all
others
at
the
expiration
of
two
months
and
a
half
the
ribs
had
been
set
up
and
the
first
planks
adjusted
it
was
already
evident
that
the
plans
made
by
cyrus
harding
were
admirable
and
that
the
vessel
would
behave
well
at
sea
pencroft
brought
to
the
task
a
devouring
energy
and
would
even
grumble
when
one
or
the
other
abandoned
the
carpenters
axe
for
the
gun
of
the
hunter
it
was
nevertheless
necessary
to
keep
up
the
stores
of
granite
house
in
view
of
the
approaching
winter
but
this
did
not
satisfy
pencroft
the
brave
honest
sailor
was
not
content
when
the
workmen
were
not
at
the
dockyard
when
this
happened
he
grumbled
vigorously
and
by
way
of
venting
his
feelings
did
the
work
of
six
men
the
weather
was
very
unfavorable
during
the
whole
of
the
summer
season
for
some
days
the
heat
was
overpowering
and
the
atmosphere
saturated
with
electricity
was
only
cleared
by
violent
storms
it
was
rarely
that
the
distant
growling
of
the
thunder
could
not
be
heard
like
a
low
but
incessant
murmur
such
as
is
produced
in
the
equatorial
regions
of
the
globe
the
1st
of
january
1869
was
signalized
by
a
storm
of
extreme
violence
and
the
thunder
burst
several
times
over
the
island
large
trees
were
struck
by
the
electric
fluid
and
shattered
and
among
others
one
of
those
gigantic
nettletrees
which
had
shaded
the
poultryyard
at
the
southern
extremity
of
the
lake
had
this
meteor
any
relation
to
the
phenomena
going
on
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
was
there
any
connection
between
the
commotion
of
the
atmosphere
and
that
of
the
interior
of
the
earth
cyrus
harding
was
inclined
to
think
that
such
was
the
case
for
the
development
of
these
storms
was
attended
by
the
renewal
of
volcanic
symptoms
it
was
on
the
3rd
of
january
that
herbert
having
ascended
at
daybreak
to
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
to
harness
one
of
the
onagers
perceived
an
enormous
hatshaped
cloud
rolling
from
the
summit
of
the
volcano
herbert
immediately
apprised
the
colonists
who
at
once
joined
him
in
watching
the
summit
of
mount
franklin
ah
exclaimed
pencroft
those
are
not
vapors
this
time
it
seems
to
me
that
the
giant
is
not
content
with
breathing
he
must
smoke
this
figure
of
speech
employed
by
the
sailor
exactly
expressed
the
changes
going
on
at
the
mouth
of
the
volcano
already
for
three
months
had
the
crater
emitted
vapors
more
or
less
dense
but
which
were
as
yet
produced
only
by
an
internal
ebullition
of
mineral
substances
but
now
the
vapors
were
replaced
by
a
thick
smoke
rising
in
the
form
of
a
grayish
column
more
than
three
hundred
feet
in
width
at
its
base
and
which
spread
like
an
immense
mushroom
to
a
height
of
from
seven
to
eight
hundred
feet
above
the
summit
of
the
mountain
the
fire
is
in
the
chimney
observed
gideon
spilett
and
we
cant
put
it
out
replied
herbert
the
volcano
ought
to
be
swept
observed
neb
who
spoke
as
if
perfectly
serious
well
said
neb
cried
pencroft
with
a
shout
of
laughter
and
youll
undertake
the
job
no
doubt
cyrus
harding
attentively
observed
the
dense
smoke
emitted
by
mount
franklin
and
even
listened
as
if
expecting
to
hear
some
distant
muttering
then
turning
towards
his
companions
from
whom
he
had
gone
somewhat
apart
he
said
the
truth
is
my
friends
we
must
not
conceal
from
ourselves
that
an
important
change
is
going
forward
the
volcanic
substances
are
no
longer
in
a
state
of
ebullition
they
have
caught
fire
and
we
are
undoubtedly
menaced
by
an
approaching
eruption
well
captain
said
pencroft
we
shall
witness
the
eruption
and
if
it
is
a
good
one
well
applaud
it
i
dont
see
that
we
need
concern
ourselves
further
about
the
matter
it
may
be
so
replied
cyrus
harding
for
the
ancient
track
of
the
lava
is
still
open
and
thanks
to
this
the
crater
has
hitherto
overflowed
towards
the
north
and
yet
and
yet
as
we
can
derive
no
advantage
from
an
eruption
it
might
be
better
it
should
not
take
place
said
the
reporter
who
knows
answered
the
sailor
perhaps
there
may
be
some
valuable
substance
in
this
volcano
which
it
will
spout
forth
and
which
we
may
turn
to
good
account
cyrus
harding
shook
his
head
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
augured
no
good
from
the
phenomenon
whose
development
had
been
so
sudden
he
did
not
regard
so
lightly
as
pencroft
the
results
of
an
eruption
if
the
lava
in
consequence
of
the
position
of
the
crater
did
not
directly
menace
the
wooded
and
cultivated
parts
of
the
island
other
complications
might
present
themselves
in
fact
eruptions
are
not
unfrequently
accompanied
by
earthquakes
and
an
island
of
the
nature
of
lincoln
island
formed
of
substances
so
varied
basalt
on
one
side
granite
on
the
other
lava
on
the
north
rich
soil
on
the
south
substances
which
consequently
could
not
be
firmly
attached
to
each
other
would
be
exposed
to
the
risk
of
disintegration
although
therefore
the
spreading
of
the
volcanic
matter
might
not
constitute
a
serious
danger
any
movement
of
the
terrestrial
structure
which
should
shake
the
island
might
entail
the
gravest
consequences
it
seems
to
me
said
ayrton
who
had
reclined
so
as
to
place
his
ear
to
the
ground
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
hear
a
dull
rumbling
sound
like
that
of
a
wagon
loaded
with
bars
of
iron
the
colonists
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
and
were
convinced
that
ayrton
was
not
mistaken
the
rumbling
was
mingled
with
a
subterranean
roar
which
formed
a
sort
of
rinforzando
and
died
slowly
away
as
if
some
violent
storm
had
passed
through
the
profundities
of
the
globe
but
no
explosion
properly
so
termed
could
be
heard
it
might
therefore
be
concluded
that
the
vapors
and
smoke
found
a
free
passage
through
the
central
shaft
and
that
the
safetyvalve
being
sufficiently
large
no
convulsion
would
be
produced
no
explosion
was
to
be
apprehended
well
then
said
pencroft
are
we
not
going
back
to
work
let
mount
franklin
smoke
groan
bellow
or
spout
forth
fire
and
flame
as
much
as
it
pleases
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
be
idle
come
ayrton
neb
herbert
captain
harding
mr
spilett
every
one
of
us
must
turn
to
at
our
work
today
we
are
going
to
place
the
keelson
and
a
dozen
pair
of
hands
would
not
be
too
many
before
two
months
i
want
our
new
bonadventurefor
we
shall
keep
the
old
name
shall
we
notto
float
on
the
waters
of
port
balloon
therefore
there
is
not
an
hour
to
lose
all
the
colonists
their
services
thus
requisitioned
by
pencroft
descended
to
the
dockyard
and
proceeded
to
place
the
keelson
a
thick
mass
of
wood
which
forms
the
lower
portion
of
a
ship
and
unites
firmly
the
timbers
of
the
hull
it
was
an
arduous
undertaking
in
which
all
took
part
they
continued
their
labors
during
the
whole
of
this
day
the
3rd
of
january
without
thinking
further
of
the
volcano
which
could
not
besides
be
seen
from
the
shore
of
granite
house
but
once
or
twice
large
shadows
veiling
the
sun
which
described
its
diurnal
arc
through
an
extremely
clear
sky
indicated
that
a
thick
cloud
of
smoke
passed
between
its
disc
and
the
island
the
wind
blowing
on
the
shore
carried
all
these
vapors
to
the
westward
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
remarked
these
somber
appearances
and
from
time
to
time
discussed
the
evident
progress
of
the
volcanic
phenomena
but
their
work
went
on
without
interruption
it
was
besides
of
the
first
importance
from
every
point
of
view
that
the
vessel
should
be
finished
with
the
least
possible
delay
in
presence
of
the
eventualities
which
might
arise
the
safety
of
the
colonists
would
be
to
a
great
extent
secured
by
their
ship
who
could
tell
that
it
might
not
prove
some
day
their
only
refuge
in
the
evening
after
supper
cyrus
harding
gideon
spilett
and
herbert
again
ascended
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
it
was
already
dark
and
the
obscurity
would
permit
them
to
ascertain
if
flames
or
incandescent
matter
thrown
up
by
the
volcano
were
mingled
with
the
vapor
and
smoke
accumulated
at
the
mouth
of
the
crater
the
crater
is
on
fire
said
herbert
who
more
active
than
his
companion
first
reached
the
plateau
mount
franklin
distant
about
six
miles
now
appeared
like
a
gigantic
torch
around
the
summit
of
which
turned
fuliginous
flames
so
much
smoke
and
possibly
scoriae
and
cinders
were
mingled
with
them
that
their
light
gleamed
but
faintly
amid
the
gloom
of
the
night
but
a
kind
of
lurid
brilliancy
spread
over
the
island
against
which
stood
out
confusedly
the
wooded
masses
of
the
heights
immense
whirlwinds
of
vapor
obscured
the
sky
through
which
glimmered
a
few
stars
the
change
is
rapid
said
the
engineer
that
is
not
surprising
answered
the
reporter
the
reawakening
of
the
volcano
already
dates
back
some
time
you
may
remember
cyrus
that
the
first
vapors
appeared
about
the
time
we
searched
the
sides
of
the
mountain
to
discover
captain
nemos
retreat
it
was
if
i
mistake
not
about
the
15th
of
october
yes
replied
herbert
two
months
and
a
half
ago
the
subterranean
fires
have
therefore
been
smoldering
for
ten
weeks
resumed
gideon
spilett
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
they
now
break
out
with
such
violence
do
not
you
feel
a
certain
vibration
of
the
soil
asked
cyrus
harding
yes
replied
gideon
spilett
but
there
is
a
great
difference
between
that
and
an
earthquake
i
do
not
affirm
that
we
are
menaced
with
an
earthquake
answered
cyrus
harding
may
god
preserve
us
from
that
no
these
vibrations
are
due
to
the
effervescence
of
the
central
fire
the
crust
of
the
earth
is
simply
the
shell
of
a
boiler
and
you
know
that
such
a
shell
under
the
pressure
of
steam
vibrates
like
a
sonorous
plate
it
is
this
effect
which
is
being
produced
at
this
moment
what
magnificent
flames
exclaimed
herbert
at
this
instant
a
kind
of
bouquet
of
flames
shot
forth
from
the
crater
the
brilliancy
of
which
was
visible
even
through
the
vapors
thousands
of
luminous
sheets
and
barbed
tongues
of
fire
were
cast
in
various
directions
some
extending
beyond
the
dome
of
smoke
dissipated
it
leaving
behind
an
incandescent
powder
this
was
accompanied
by
successive
explosions
resembling
the
discharge
of
a
battery
of
machineguns
cyrus
harding
the
reporter
and
herbert
after
spending
an
hour
on
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
again
descended
to
the
beach
and
returned
to
granite
house
the
engineer
was
thoughtful
and
preoccupied
so
much
so
indeed
that
gideon
spilett
inquired
if
he
apprehended
any
immediate
danger
of
which
the
eruption
might
directly
or
indirectly
be
the
cause
yes
and
no
answered
cyrus
harding
nevertheless
continued
the
reporter
would
not
the
greatest
misfortune
which
could
happen
to
us
be
an
earthquake
which
would
overturn
the
island
now
i
do
not
suppose
that
this
is
to
be
feared
since
the
vapors
and
lava
have
found
a
free
outlet
true
replied
cyrus
harding
and
i
do
not
fear
an
earthquake
in
the
sense
in
which
the
term
is
commonly
applied
to
convulsions
of
the
soil
provoked
by
the
expansion
of
subterranean
gases
but
other
causes
may
produce
great
disasters
how
so
my
dear
cyrus
i
am
not
certain
i
must
consider
i
must
visit
the
mountain
in
a
few
days
i
shall
learn
more
on
this
point
gideon
spilett
said
no
more
and
soon
in
spite
of
the
explosions
of
the
volcano
whose
intensity
increased
and
which
were
repeated
by
the
echoes
of
the
island
the
inhabitants
of
granite
house
were
sleeping
soundly
three
days
passed
bythe
4th
5th
and
6th
of
january
the
construction
of
the
vessel
was
diligently
continued
and
without
offering
further
explanations
the
engineer
pushed
forward
the
work
with
all
his
energy
mount
franklin
was
now
hooded
by
a
somber
cloud
of
sinister
aspect
and
amid
the
flames
vomiting
forth
incandescent
rocks
some
of
which
fell
back
into
the
crater
itself
this
caused
pencroft
who
would
only
look
at
the
matter
in
the
light
of
a
joke
to
exclaim
ah
the
giant
is
playing
at
cup
and
ball
he
is
a
conjurer
in
fact
the
substances
thrown
up
fell
back
again
in
to
the
abyss
and
it
did
not
seem
that
the
lava
though
swollen
by
the
internal
pressure
had
yet
risen
to
the
orifice
of
the
crater
at
any
rate
the
opening
on
the
northeast
which
was
partly
visible
poured
out
no
torrent
upon
the
northern
slope
of
the
mountain
nevertheless
however
pressing
was
the
construction
of
the
vessel
other
duties
demanded
the
presence
of
the
colonists
on
various
portions
of
the
island
before
everything
it
was
necessary
to
go
to
the
corral
where
the
flocks
of
musmons
and
goats
were
enclosed
and
replenish
the
provision
of
forage
for
those
animals
it
was
accordingly
arranged
that
ayrton
should
proceed
thither
the
next
day
the
7th
of
january
and
as
he
was
sufficient
for
the
task
to
which
he
was
accustomed
pencroft
and
the
rest
were
somewhat
surprised
on
hearing
the
engineer
say
to
ayrton
as
you
are
going
tomorrow
to
the
corral
i
will
accompany
you
but
captain
harding
exclaimed
the
sailor
our
working
days
will
not
be
many
and
if
you
go
also
we
shall
be
two
pair
of
hands
short
we
shall
return
tomorrow
replied
cyrus
harding
but
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
go
to
the
corral
i
must
learn
how
the
eruption
is
progressing
the
eruption
always
the
eruption
answered
pencroft
with
an
air
of
discontent
an
important
thing
truly
this
eruption
i
trouble
myself
very
little
about
it
whatever
might
be
the
sailors
opinion
the
expedition
projected
by
the
engineer
was
settled
for
the
next
day
herbert
wished
to
accompany
cyrus
harding
but
he
would
not
vex
pencroft
by
his
absence
the
next
day
at
dawn
cyrus
harding
and
ayrton
mounting
the
cart
drawn
by
two
onagers
took
the
road
to
the
corral
and
set
off
at
a
round
trot
above
the
forest
were
passing
large
clouds
to
which
the
crater
of
mount
franklin
incessantly
added
fuliginous
matter
these
clouds
which
rolled
heavily
in
the
air
were
evidently
composed
of
heterogeneous
substances
it
was
not
alone
from
the
volcano
that
they
derived
their
strange
opacity
and
weight
scoriae
in
a
state
of
dust
like
powdered
pumicestone
and
grayish
ashes
as
small
as
the
finest
feculae
were
held
in
suspension
in
the
midst
of
their
thick
folds
these
ashes
are
so
fine
that
they
have
been
observed
in
the
air
for
whole
months
after
the
eruption
of
1783
in
iceland
for
upwards
of
a
year
the
atmosphere
was
thus
charged
with
volcanic
dust
through
which
the
rays
of
the
sun
were
only
with
difficulty
discernible
but
more
often
this
pulverized
matter
falls
and
this
happened
on
the
present
occasion
cyrus
harding
and
ayrton
had
scarcely
reached
the
corral
when
a
sort
of
black
snow
like
fine
gunpowder
fell
and
instantly
changed
the
appearance
of
the
soil
trees
meadows
all
disappeared
beneath
a
covering
several
inches
in
depth
but
very
fortunately
the
wind
blew
from
the
northeast
and
the
greater
part
of
the
cloud
dissolved
itself
over
the
sea
this
is
very
singular
captain
harding
said
ayrton
it
is
very
serious
replied
the
engineer
this
powdered
pumicestone
all
this
mineral
dust
proves
how
grave
is
the
convulsion
going
forward
in
the
lower
depths
of
the
volcano
but
can
nothing
be
done
nothing
except
to
note
the
progress
of
the
phenomenon
do
you
therefore
ayrton
occupy
yourself
with
the
necessary
work
at
the
corral
in
the
meantime
i
will
ascend
just
beyond
the
source
of
red
creek
and
examine
the
condition
of
the
mountain
upon
its
northern
aspect
then
well
captain
harding
then
we
will
pay
a
visit
to
dakkar
grotto
i
wish
to
inspect
it
at
any
rate
i
will
come
back
for
you
in
two
hours
ayrton
then
proceeded
to
enter
the
corral
and
while
awaiting
the
engineers
return
busied
himself
with
the
musmons
and
goats
which
seemed
to
feel
a
certain
uneasiness
in
presence
of
these
first
signs
of
an
eruption
meanwhile
cyrus
harding
ascended
the
crest
of
the
eastern
spur
passed
red
creek
and
arrived
at
the
spot
where
he
and
his
companions
had
discovered
a
sulphurous
spring
at
the
time
of
their
first
exploration
how
changed
was
everything
instead
of
a
single
column
of
smoke
he
counted
thirteen
forced
through
the
soil
as
if
violently
propelled
by
some
piston
it
was
evident
that
the
crust
of
the
earth
was
subjected
in
this
part
of
the
globe
to
a
frightful
pressure
the
atmosphere
was
saturated
with
gases
and
carbonic
acid
mingled
with
aqueous
vapors
cyrus
harding
felt
the
volcanic
tufa
with
which
the
plain
was
strewn
and
which
was
but
pulverized
cinders
hardened
into
solid
blocks
by
time
tremble
beneath
him
but
he
could
discover
no
traces
of
fresh
lava
the
engineer
became
more
assured
of
this
when
he
observed
all
the
northern
part
of
mount
franklin
pillars
of
smoke
and
flame
escaped
from
the
crater
a
hail
of
scoriae
fell
on
the
ground
but
no
current
of
lava
burst
from
the
mouth
of
the
volcano
which
proved
that
the
volcanic
matter
had
not
yet
attained
the
level
of
the
superior
orifice
of
the
central
shaft
but
i
would
prefer
that
it
were
so
said
cyrus
harding
to
himself
at
any
rate
i
should
then
know
that
the
lava
had
followed
its
accustomed
track
who
can
say
that
it
may
not
take
a
new
course
but
the
danger
does
not
consist
in
that
captain
nemo
foresaw
it
clearly
no
the
danger
does
not
lie
there
cyrus
harding
advanced
towards
the
enormous
causeway
whose
prolongation
enclosed
the
narrow
shark
gulf
he
could
now
sufficiently
examine
on
this
side
the
ancient
channels
of
the
lava
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
the
most
recent
eruption
had
occurred
at
a
fardistant
epoch
he
then
returned
by
the
same
way
listening
attentively
to
the
subterranean
mutterings
which
rolled
like
longcontinued
thunder
interrupted
by
deafening
explosions
at
nine
in
the
morning
he
reached
the
corral
ayrton
awaited
him
the
animals
are
cared
for
captain
harding
said
ayrton
good
ayrton
they
seem
uneasy
captain
harding
yes
instinct
speaks
through
them
and
instinct
is
never
deceived
are
you
ready
take
a
lamp
ayrton
answered
the
engineer
we
will
start
at
once
ayrton
did
as
desired
the
onagers
unharnessed
roamed
in
the
corral
the
gate
was
secured
on
the
outside
and
cyrus
harding
preceding
ayrton
took
the
narrow
path
which
led
westward
to
the
shore
the
soil
they
walked
upon
was
choked
with
the
pulverized
matter
fallen
from
the
cloud
no
quadruped
appeared
in
the
woods
even
the
birds
had
fled
sometimes
a
passing
breeze
raised
the
covering
of
ashes
and
the
two
colonists
enveloped
in
a
whirlwind
of
dust
lost
sight
of
each
other
they
were
then
careful
to
cover
their
eyes
and
mouths
with
handkerchiefs
for
they
ran
the
risk
of
being
blinded
and
suffocated
it
was
impossible
for
cyrus
harding
and
ayrton
with
these
impediments
to
make
rapid
progress
moreover
the
atmosphere
was
close
as
if
the
oxygen
had
been
partly
burned
up
and
had
become
unfit
for
respiration
at
every
hundred
paces
they
were
obliged
to
stop
to
take
breath
it
was
therefore
past
ten
oclock
when
the
engineer
and
his
companion
reached
the
crest
of
the
enormous
mass
of
rocks
of
basalt
and
porphyry
which
composed
the
northwest
coast
of
the
island
ayrton
and
cyrus
harding
commenced
the
descent
of
this
abrupt
declivity
following
almost
step
for
step
the
difficult
path
which
during
that
stormy
night
had
led
them
to
dakkar
grotto
in
open
day
the
descent
was
less
perilous
and
besides
the
bed
of
ashes
which
covered
the
polished
surface
of
the
rock
enabled
them
to
make
their
footing
more
secure
the
ridge
at
the
end
of
the
shore
about
forty
feet
in
height
was
soon
reached
cyrus
harding
recollected
that
this
elevation
gradually
sloped
towards
the
level
of
the
sea
although
the
tide
was
at
present
low
no
beach
could
be
seen
and
the
waves
thickened
by
the
volcanic
dust
beat
upon
the
basaltic
rocks
cyrus
harding
and
ayrton
found
without
difficulty
the
entrance
to
dakkar
grotto
and
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
last
rock
before
it
the
iron
boat
should
be
there
said
the
engineer
it
is
here
captain
harding
replied
ayrton
drawing
towards
him
the
fragile
craft
which
was
protected
by
the
arch
of
the
vault
on
board
ayrton
the
two
colonists
stepped
into
the
boat
a
slight
undulation
of
the
waves
carried
it
farther
under
the
low
arch
of
the
crypt
and
there
ayrton
with
the
aid
of
flint
and
steel
lighted
the
lamp
he
then
took
the
oars
and
the
lamp
having
been
placed
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
so
that
its
rays
fell
before
them
cyrus
harding
took
the
helm
and
steered
through
the
shades
of
the
grotto
the
nautilus
was
there
no
longer
to
illuminate
the
cavern
with
its
electric
light
possibly
it
might
not
yet
be
extinguished
but
no
ray
escaped
from
the
depths
of
the
abyss
in
which
reposed
all
that
was
mortal
of
captain
nemo
the
light
afforded
by
the
lamp
although
feeble
nevertheless
enabled
the
engineer
to
advance
slowly
following
the
wall
of
the
cavern
a
deathlike
silence
reigned
under
the
vaulted
roof
or
at
least
in
the
anterior
portion
for
soon
cyrus
harding
distinctly
heard
the
rumbling
which
proceeded
from
the
bowels
of
the
mountain
that
comes
from
the
volcano
he
said
besides
these
sounds
the
presence
of
chemical
combinations
was
soon
betrayed
by
their
powerful
odor
and
the
engineer
and
his
companion
were
almost
suffocated
by
sulphurous
vapors
this
is
what
captain
nemo
feared
murmured
cyrus
harding
changing
countenance
we
must
go
to
the
end
notwithstanding
forward
replied
ayrton
bending
to
his
oars
and
directing
the
boat
towards
the
head
of
the
cavern
twentyfive
minutes
after
entering
the
mouth
of
the
grotto
the
boat
reached
the
extreme
end
cyrus
harding
then
standing
up
cast
the
light
of
the
lamp
upon
the
walls
of
the
cavern
which
separated
it
from
the
central
shaft
of

what
was
the
thickness
of
this
wall
it
might
be
ten
feet
or
a
hundred
feetit
was
impossible
to
say
but
the
subterranean
sounds
were
too
perceptible
to
allow
of
the
supposition
that
it
was
of
any
great
thickness
the
engineer
after
having
explored
the
wall
at
a
certain
height
horizontally
fastened
the
lamp
to
the
end
of
an
oar
and
again
surveyed
the
basaltic
wall
at
a
greater
elevation
there
through
scarcely
visible
clefts
and
joinings
escaped
a
pungent
vapor
which
infected
the
atmosphere
of
the
cavern
the
wall
was
broken
by
large
cracks
some
of
which
extended
to
within
two
or
three
feet
of
the
waters
edge
cyrus
harding
thought
for
a
brief
space
then
he
said
in
a
low
voice
yes
the
captain
was
right
the
danger
lies
there
and
a
terrible
danger
ayrton
said
not
a
word
but
upon
a
sign
from
cyrus
harding
resumed
the
oars
and
half
an
hour
later
the
engineer
and
he
reached
the
entrance
of
dakkar

the
next
day
the
8th
day
of
january
after
a
day
and
night
passed
at
the
corral
where
they
left
all
in
order
cyrus
harding
and
ayrton
arrived
at
granite
house
the
engineer
immediately
called
his
companions
together
and
informed
them
of
the
imminent
danger
which
threatened
lincoln
island
and
from
which
no
human
power
could
deliver
them
my
friends
he
said
and
his
voice
betrayed
the
depth
of
his
emotion
our
island
is
not
among
those
which
will
endure
while
this
earth
endures
it
is
doomed
to
more
or
less
speedy
destruction
the
cause
of
which
it
bears
within
itself
and
from
which
nothing
can
save
it
the
colonists
looked
at
each
other
then
at
the
engineer
they
did
not
clearly
comprehend
him
explain
yourself
cyrus
said
gideon
spilett
i
will
do
so
replied
cyrus
harding
or
rather
i
will
simply
afford
you
the
explanation
which
during
our
few
minutes
of
private
conversation
was
given
me
by
captain
nemo
captain
nemo
exclaimed
the
colonists
yes
and
it
was
the
last
service
he
desired
to
render
us
before
his
death
the
last
service
exclaimed
pencroft
the
last
service
you
will
see
that
though
he
is
dead
he
will
render
us
others
yet
but
what
did
the
captain
say
inquired
the
reporter
i
will
tell
you
my
friends
said
the
engineer
lincoln
island
does
not
resemble
the
other
islands
of
the
pacific
and
a
fact
of
which
captain
nemo
has
made
me
cognizant
must
sooner
or
later
bring
about
the
subversion
of
its
foundation
nonsense
lincoln
island
it
cant
be
cried
pencroft
who
in
spite
of
the
respect
he
felt
for
cyrus
harding
could
not
prevent
a
gesture
of
incredulity
listen
pencroft
resumed
the
engineer
i
will
tell
you
what
captain
nemo
communicated
to
me
and
which
i
myself
confirmed
yesterday
during
the
exploration
of
dakkar
grotto
this
cavern
stretches
under
the
island
as
far
as
the
volcano
and
is
only
separated
from
its
central
shaft
by
the
wall
which
terminates
it
now
this
wall
is
seamed
with
fissures
and
clefts
which
already
allow
the
sulphurous
gases
generated
in
the
interior
of
the
volcano
to
escape
well
said
pencroft
his
brow
suddenly
contracting
well
then
i
saw
that
these
fissures
widen
under
the
internal
pressure
from
within
that
the
wall
of
basalt
is
gradually
giving
way
and
that
after
a
longer
or
shorter
period
it
will
afford
a
passage
to
the
waters
of
the
lake
which
fill
the
cavern
good
replied
pencroft
with
an
attempt
at
pleasantry
the
sea
will
extinguish
the
volcano
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
matter
not
so
said
cyrus
harding
should
a
day
arrive
when
the
sea
rushing
through
the
wall
of
the
cavern
penetrates
by
the
central
shaft
into
the
interior
of
the
island
to
the
boiling
lava
lincoln
island
will
that
day
be
blown
into
the
airjust
as
would
happen
to
the
island
of
sicily
were
the
mediterranean
to
precipitate
itself
into
mount
etna
the
colonists
made
no
answer
to
these
significant
words
of
the
engineer
they
now
understood
the
danger
by
which
they
were
menaced
it
may
be
added
that
cyrus
harding
had
in
no
way
exaggerated
the
danger
to
be
apprehended
many
persons
have
formed
an
idea
that
it
would
be
possible
to
extinguish
volcanoes
which
are
almost
always
situated
on
the
shores
of
a
sea
or
lake
by
opening
a
passage
for
the
admission
of
the
water
but
they
are
not
aware
that
this
would
be
to
incur
the
risk
of
blowing
up
a
portion
of
the
globe
like
a
boiler
whose
steam
is
suddenly
expanded
by
intense
heat
the
water
rushing
into
a
cavity
whose
temperature
might
be
estimated
at
thousands
of
degrees
would
be
converted
into
steam
with
a
sudden
energy
which
no
enclosure
could
resist
it
was
not
therefore
doubtful
that
the
island
menaced
by
a
frightful
and
approaching
convulsion
would
endure
only
so
long
as
the
wall
of
dakkar
grotto
itself
should
endure
it
was
not
even
a
question
of
months
nor
of
weeks
but
of
days
it
might
be
of
hours
the
first
sentiment
which
the
colonists
felt
was
that
of
profound
sorrow
they
thought
not
so
much
of
the
peril
which
menaced
themselves
personally
but
of
the
destruction
of
the
island
which
had
sheltered
them
which
they
had
cultivated
which
they
loved
so
well
and
had
hoped
to
render
so
flourishing
so
much
effort
ineffectually
expended
so
much
labor
lost
pencroft
could
not
prevent
a
large
tear
from
rolling
down
his
cheek
nor
did
he
attempt
to
conceal
it
some
further
conversation
now
took
place
the
chances
yet
in
favor
of
the
colonists
were
discussed
but
finally
it
was
agreed
that
there
was
not
an
hour
to
be
lost
that
the
building
and
fitting
of
the
vessel
should
be
pushed
forward
with
their
utmost
energy
and
that
this
was
the
sole
chance
of
safety
for
the
inhabitants
of
lincoln
island
all
hands
therefore
set
to
work
on
the
vessel
what
could
it
avail
to
sow
to
reap
to
hunt
to
increase
the
stores
of
granite
house
the
contents
of
the
storehouse
and
outbuildings
contained
more
than
sufficient
to
provide
the
ship
for
a
voyage
however
long
might
be
its
duration
but
it
was
imperative
that
the
ship
should
be
ready
to
receive
them
before
the
inevitable
catastrophe
should
arrive
their
labors
were
now
carried
on
with
feverish
ardor
by
the
23rd
of
january
the
vessel
was
halfdecked
over
up
to
this
time
no
change
had
taken
place
on
the
summit
of
the
volcano
vapor
and
smoke
mingled
with
flames
and
incandescent
stones
were
thrown
up
from
the
crater
but
during
the
night
of
the
23rd
in
consequence
of
the
lava
attaining
the
level
of
the
first
stratum
of
the
volcano
the
hatshaped
cone
which
formed
over
the
latter
disappeared
a
frightful
sound
was
heard
the
colonists
at
first
thought
the
island
was
rent
asunder
and
rushed
out
of
granite
house
this
occurred
about
two
oclock
in
the
morning
the
sky
appeared
on
fire
the
superior
cone
a
mass
of
rock
a
thousand
feet
in
height
and
weighing
thousands
of
millions
of
pounds
had
been
thrown
down
upon
the
island
making
it
tremble
to
its
foundation
fortunately
this
cone
inclined
to
the
north
and
had
fallen
upon
the
plain
of
sand
and
tufa
stretching
between
the
volcano
and
the
sea
the
aperture
of
the
crater
being
thus
enlarged
projected
towards
the
sky
a
glare
so
intense
that
by
the
simple
effect
of
reflection
the
atmosphere
appeared
redhot
at
the
same
time
a
torrent
of
lava
bursting
from
the
new
summit
poured
out
in
long
cascades
like
water
escaping
from
a
vase
too
full
and
a
thousand
tongues
of
fire
crept
over
the
sides
of
the
volcano
the
corral
the
corral
exclaimed
ayrton
it
was
in
fact
towards
the
corral
that
the
lava
was
rushing
as
the
new
crater
faced
the
east
and
consequently
the
fertile
portions
of
the
island
the
springs
of
red
creek
and
jacamar
wood
were
menaced
with
instant
destruction
at
ayrtons
cry
the
colonists
rushed
to
the
onagers
stables
the
cart
was
at
once
harnessed
all
were
possessed
by
the
same
thoughtto
hasten
to
the
corral
and
set
at
liberty
the
animals
it
enclosed
before
three
in
the
morning
they
arrived
at
the
corral
the
cries
of
the
terrified
musmons
and
goats
indicated
the
alarm
which
possessed
them
already
a
torrent
of
burning
matter
and
liquefied
minerals
fell
from
the
side
of
the
mountain
upon
the
meadows
as
far
as
the
side
of
the
palisade
the
gate
was
burst
open
by
ayrton
and
the
animals
bewildered
with
terror
fled
in
all
directions
an
hour
afterwards
the
boiling
lava
filled
the
corral
converting
into
vapor
the
water
of
the
little
rivulet
which
ran
through
it
burning
up
the
house
like
dry
grass
and
leaving
not
even
a
post
of
the
palisade
to
mark
the
spot
where
the
corral
once
stood
to
contend
against
this
disaster
would
have
been
follynay

grand

it
was
now
daylightthe
24th
of

cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
before
returning
to
granite
house
desired
to
ascertain
the
probable
direction
this
inundation
of
lava
was
about
to
take
the
soil
sloped
gradually
from
mount
franklin
to
the
east
coast
and
it
was
to
be
feared
that
in
spite
of
the
thick
jacamar
wood
the
torrent
would
reach
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
the
lake
will
cover
us
said
gideon
spilett
i
hope
so
was
cyrus
hardings
only
reply
the
colonists
were
desirous
of
reaching
the
plain
upon
which
the
superior
cone
of
mount
franklin
had
fallen
but
the
lava
arrested
their
progress
it
had
followed
on
one
side
the
valley
of
red
creek
and
on
the
other
that
of
falls
river
evaporating
those
watercourses
in
its
passage
there
was
no
possibility
of
crossing
the
torrent
of
lava
on
the
contrary
the
colonists
were
obliged
to
retreat
before
it
the
volcano
without
its
crown
was
no
longer
recognizable
terminated
as
it
was
by
a
sort
of
flat
table
which
replaced
the
ancient
crater
from
two
openings
in
its
southern
and
eastern
sides
an
unceasing
flow
of
lava
poured
forth
thus
forming
two
distinct
streams
above
the
new
crater
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
ashes
mingled
with
those
of
the
atmosphere
massed
over
the
island
loud
peals
of
thunder
broke
and
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
from
the
rumblings
of
the
mountain
whose
mouth
vomited
forth
ignited
rocks
which
hurled
to
more
than
a
thousand
feet
burst
in
the
air
like
shells
flashes
of
lightning
rivaled
in
intensity
the
volcanos
eruption
towards
seven
in
the
morning
the
position
was
no
longer
tenable
by
the
colonists
who
accordingly
took
shelter
in
the
borders
of
jacamar
wood
not
only
did
the
projectiles
begin
to
rain
around
them
but
the
lava
overflowing
the
bed
of
red
creek
threatened
to
cut
off
the
road
to
the
corral
the
nearest
rows
of
trees
caught
fire
and
their
sap
suddenly
transformed
into
vapor
caused
them
to
explode
with
loud
reports
while
others
less
moist
remained
unhurt
in
the
midst
of
the
inundation
the
colonists
had
again
taken
the
road
to
the
corral
they
proceeded
but
slowly
frequently
looking
back
but
in
consequence
of
the
inclination
of
the
soil
the
lava
gained
rapidly
in
the
east
and
as
its
lower
waves
became
solidified
others
at
boiling
heat
covered
them
immediately
meanwhile
the
principal
stream
of
red
creek
valley
became
more
and
more
menacing
all
this
portion
of
the
forest
was
on
fire
and
enormous
wreaths
of
smoke
rolled
over
the
trees
whose
trunks
were
already
consumed
by
the
lava
the
colonists
halted
near
the
lake
about
half
a
mile
from
the
mouth
of
red
creek
a
question
of
life
or
death
was
now
to
be
decided
cyrus
harding
accustomed
to
the
consideration
of
important
crises
and
aware
that
he
was
addressing
men
capable
of
hearing
the
truth
whatever
it
might
be
then
said
either
the
lake
will
arrest
the
progress
of
the
lava
and
a
part
of
the
island
will
be
preserved
from
utter
destruction
or
the
stream
will
overrun
the
forests
of
the
far
west
and
not
a
tree
or
plant
will
remain
on
the
surface
of
the
soil
we
shall
have
no
prospect
but
that
of
starvation
upon
these
barren
rocksa
death
which
will
probably
be
anticipated
by
the
explosion
of
the
island
in
that
case
replied
pencroft
folding
his
arms
and
stamping
his
foot
whats
the
use
of
working
any
longer
on
the
vessel
pencroft
answered
cyrus
harding
we
must
do
our
duty
to
the
last
at
this
instant
the
river
of
lava
after
having
broken
a
passage
through
the
noble
trees
it
devoured
in
its
course
reached
the
borders
of
the
lake
at
this
point
there
was
an
elevation
of
the
soil
which
had
it
been
greater
might
have
sufficed
to
arrest
the
torrent
to
work
cried
cyrus
harding
the
engineers
thought
was
at
once
understood
it
might
be
possible
to
dam
as
it
were
the
torrent
and
thus
compel
it
to
pour
itself
into
the
lake
the
colonists
hastened
to
the
dockyard
they
returned
with
shovels
picks
axes
and
by
means
of
banking
the
earth
with
the
aid
of
fallen
trees
they
succeeded
in
a
few
hours
in
raising
an
embankment
three
feet
high
and
some
hundreds
of
paces
in
length
it
seemed
to
them
when
they
had
finished
as
if
they
had
scarcely
been
working
more
than
a
few
minutes
it
was
not
a
moment
too
soon
the
liquefied
substances
soon
after
reached
the
bottom
of
the
barrier
the
stream
of
lava
swelled
like
a
river
about
to
overflow
its
banks
and
threatened
to
demolish
the
sole
obstacle
which
could
prevent
it
from
overrunning
the
whole
far
west
but
the
dam
held
firm
and
after
a
moment
of
terrible
suspense
the
torrent
precipitated
itself
into
grant
lake
from
a
height
of
twenty
feet
the
colonists
without
moving
or
uttering
a
word
breathlessly
regarded
this
strife
of
the
two
elements
what
a
spectacle
was
this
conflict
between
water
and
fire
what
pen
could
describe
the
marvelous
horror
of
this
scenewhat
pencil
could
depict
it
the
water
hissed
as
it
evaporated
by
contact
with
the
boiling
lava
the
vapor
whirled
in
the
air
to
an
immeasurable
height
as
if
the
valves
of
an
immense
boiler
had
been
suddenly
opened
but
however
considerable
might
be
the
volume
of
water
contained
in
the
lake
it
must
eventually
be
absorbed
because
it
was
not
replenished
while
the
stream
of
lava
fed
from
an
inexhaustible
source
rolled
on
without
ceasing
new
waves
of
incandescent
matter
the
first
waves
of
lava
which
fell
in
the
lake
immediately
solidified
and
accumulated
so
as
speedily
to
emerge
from
it
upon
their
surface
fell
other
waves
which
in
their
turn
became
stone
but
a
step
nearer
the
center
of
the
lake
in
this
manner
was
formed
a
pier
which
threatened
to
gradually
fill
up
the
lake
which
could
not
overflow
the
water
displaced
by
the
lava
being
evaporated
the
hissing
of
the
water
rent
the
air
with
a
deafening
sound
and
the
vapor
blown
by
the
wind
fell
in
rain
upon
the
sea
the
pier
became
longer
and
longer
and
the
blocks
of
lava
piled
themselves
one
on
another
where
formerly
stretched
the
calm
waters
of
the
lake
now
appeared
an
enormous
mass
of
smoking
rocks
as
if
an
upheaving
of
the
soil
had
formed
immense
shoals
imagine
the
waters
of
the
lake
aroused
by
a
hurricane
then
suddenly
solidified
by
an
intense
frost
and
some
conception
may
be
formed
of
the
aspect
of
the
lake
three
hours
after
the
eruption
of
this
irresistible
torrent
of
lava
this
time
water
would
be
vanquished
by
fire
nevertheless
it
was
a
fortunate
circumstance
for
the
colonists
that
the
effusion
of
lava
should
have
been
in
the
direction
of
lake
grant
they
had
before
them
some
days
respite
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
granite
house
and
the
dockyard
were
for
the
moment
preserved
and
these
few
days
it
was
necessary
to
employ
in
planking
and
carefully
calking
the
vessel
and
launching
her
the
colonists
would
then
take
refuge
on
board
the
vessel
content
to
rig
her
after
she
should
be
afloat
on
the
waters
with
the
danger
of
an
explosion
which
threatened
to
destroy
the
island
there
could
be
no
security
on
shore
the
walls
of
granite
house
once
so
sure
a
retreat
might
at
any
moment
fall
in
upon
them
during
the
six
following
days
from
the
25th
to
the
30th
of
january
the
colonists
accomplished
as
much
of
the
construction
of
their
vessel
as
twenty
men
could
have
done
they
hardly
allowed
themselves
a
moments
repose
and
the
glare
of
the
flames
which
shot
from
the
crater
enabled
them
to
work
night
and
day
the
flow
of
lava
continued
but
perhaps
less
abundantly
this
was
fortunate
for
lake
grant
was
almost
entirely
choked
up
and
if
more
lava
should
accumulate
it
would
inevitably
spread
over
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
and
thence
upon
the
beach
but
if
the
island
was
thus
partially
protected
on
this
side
it
was
not
so
with
the
western
part
in
fact
the
second
stream
of
lava
which
had
followed
the
valley
of
falls
river
a
valley
of
great
extent
the
land
on
both
sides
of
the
creek
being
flat
met
with
no
obstacle
the
burning
liquid
had
then
spread
through
the
forest
of
the
far
west
at
this
period
of
the
year
when
the
trees
were
dried
up
by
a
tropical
heat
the
forest
caught
fire
instantaneously
in
such
a
manner
that
the
conflagration
extended
itself
both
by
the
trunks
of
the
trees
and
by
their
higher
branches
whose
interlacement
favored
its
progress
it
even
appeared
that
the
current
of
flame
spread
more
rapidly
among
the
summits
of
the
trees
than
the
current
of
lava
at
their
bases
thus
it
happened
that
the
wild
animals
jaguars
wild
boars
capybaras
koalas
and
game
of
every
kind
mad
with
terror
had
fled
to
the
banks
of
the
mercy
and
to
the
tadorn
marsh
beyond
the
road
to
port
balloon
but
the
colonists
were
too
much
occupied
with
their
task
to
pay
any
attention
to
even
the
most
formidable
of
these
animals
they
had
abandoned
granite
house
and
would
not
even
take
shelter
at
the
chimneys
but
encamped
under
a
tent
near
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
each
day
cyrus
harding
and
gideon
spilett
ascended
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
sometimes
herbert
accompanied
them
but
never
pencroft
who
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
the
prospect
of
the
island
now
so
utterly
devastated
it
was
in
truth
a
heartrending
spectacle
all
the
wooded
part
of
the
island
was
now
completely
bare
one
single
clump
of
green
trees
raised
their
heads
at
the
extremity
of
serpentine
peninsula
here
and
there
were
a
few
grotesque
blackened
and
branchless
stumps
the
side
of
the
devastated
forest
was
even
more
barren
than
tadorn
marsh
the
eruption
of
lava
had
been
complete
where
formerly
sprang
up
that
charming
verdure
the
soil
was
now
nothing
but
a
savage
mass
of
volcanic
tufa
in
the
valleys
of
the
falls
and
mercy
rivers
no
drop
of
water
now
flowed
towards
the
sea
and
should
lake
grant
be
entirely
dried
up
the
colonists
would
have
no
means
of
quenching
their
thirst
but
fortunately
the
lava
had
spared
the
southern
corner
of
the
lake
containing
all
that
remained
of
the
drinking
water
of
the
island
towards
the
northwest
stood
out
the
rugged
and
welldefined
outlines
of
the
sides
of
the
volcano
like
a
gigantic
claw
hovering
over
the
island
what
a
sad
and
fearful
sight
and
how
painful
to
the
colonists
who
from
a
fertile
domain
covered
with
forests
irrigated
by
watercourses
and
enriched
by
the
produce
of
their
toils
found
themselves
as
it
were
transported
to
a
desolate
rock
upon
which
but
for
their
reserves
of
provisions
they
could
not
even
gather
the
means
of
subsistence
it
is
enough
to
break
ones
heart
said
gideon
spilett
one
day
yes
spilett
answered
the
engineer
may
god
grant
us
the
time
to
complete
this
vessel
now
our
sole
refuge
do
not
you
think
cyrus
that
the
violence
of
the
eruption
has
somewhat
lessened
the
volcano
still
vomits
forth
lava
but
somewhat
less
abundantly
if
i
mistake
not
it
matters
little
answered
cyrus
harding
the
fire
is
still
burning
in
the
interior
of
the
mountain
and
the
sea
may
break
in
at
any
moment
we
are
in
the
condition
of
passengers
whose
ship
is
devoured
by
a
conflagration
which
they
cannot
extinguish
and
who
know
that
sooner
or
later
the
flames
must
reach
the
powdermagazine
to
work
spilett
to
work
and
let
us
not
lose
an
hour
during
eight
days
more
that
is
to
say
until
the
7th
of
february
the
lava
continued
to
flow
but
the
eruption
was
confined
within
the
previous
limits
cyrus
harding
feared
above
all
lest
the
liquefied
matter
should
overflow
the
shore
for
in
that
event
the
dockyard
could
not
escape
moreover
about
this
time
the
colonists
felt
in
the
frame
of
the
island
vibrations
which
alarmed
them
to
the
highest
degree
it
was
the
20th
of
february
yet
another
month
must
elapse
before
the
vessel
would
be
ready
for
sea
would
the
island
hold
together
till
then
the
intention
of
pencroft
and
cyrus
harding
was
to
launch
the
vessel
as
soon
as
the
hull
should
be
complete
the
deck
the
upperworks
the
interior
woodwork
and
the
rigging
might
be
finished
afterwards
but
the
essential
point
was
that
the
colonists
should
have
an
assured
refuge
away
from
the
island
perhaps
it
might
be
even
better
to
conduct
the
vessel
to
port
balloon
that
is
to
say
as
far
as
possible
from
the
center
of
eruption
for
at
the
mouth
of
the
mercy
between
the
islet
and
the
wall
of
granite
it
would
run
the
risk
of
being
crushed
in
the
event
of
any
convulsion
all
the
exertions
of
the
voyagers
were
therefore
concentrated
upon
the
completion
of
the
hull
thus
the
3rd
of
march
arrived
and
they
might
calculate
upon
launching
the
vessel
in
ten
days
hope
revived
in
the
hearts
of
the
colonists
who
had
in
this
fourth
year
of
their
sojourn
on
lincoln
island
suffered
so
many
trials
even
pencroft
lost
in
some
measure
the
somber
taciturnity
occasioned
by
the
devastation
and
ruin
of
his
domain
his
hopes
it
is
true
were
concentrated
upon
his
vessel
we
shall
finish
it
he
said
to
the
engineer
we
shall
finish
it
captain
and
it
is
time
for
the
season
is
advancing
and
the
equinox
will
soon
be
here
well
if
necessary
we
must
put
in
to
tabor
island
to
spend
the
winter
but
think
of
tabor
island
after
lincoln
island
ah
how
unfortunate
who
could
have
believed
it
possible
let
us
get
on
was
the
engineers
invariable
reply
and
they
worked
away
without
losing
a
moment
master
asked
neb
a
few
days
later
do
you
think
all
this
could
have
happened
if
captain
nemo
had
been
still
alive
certainly
neb
answered
cyrus
harding
i
for
one
dont
believe
it
whispered
pencroft
to
neb
nor
i
answered
neb
seriously
during
the
first
week
of
march
appearances
again
became
menacing
thousands
of
threads
like
glass
formed
of
fluid
lava
fell
like
rain
upon
the
island
the
crater
was
again
boiling
with
lava
which
overflowed
the
back
of
the
volcano
the
torrent
flowed
along
the
surface
of
the
hardened
tufa
and
destroyed
the
few
meager
skeletons
of
trees
which
had
withstood
the
first
eruption
the
stream
flowing
this
time
towards
the
southwest
shore
of
lake
grant
stretched
beyond
creek
glycerine
and
invaded
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
this
last
blow
to
the
work
of
the
colonists
was
terrible
the
mill
the
buildings
of
the
inner
court
the
stables
were
all
destroyed
the
affrighted
poultry
fled
in
all
directions
top
and
jup
showed
signs
of
the
greatest
alarm
as
if
their
instinct
warned
them
of
an
impending
catastrophe
a
large
number
of
the
animals
of
the
island
had
perished
in
the
first
eruption
those
which
survived
found
no
refuge
but
tadorn
marsh
save
a
few
to
which
the
plateau
of
prospect
heights
afforded
asylum
but
even
this
last
retreat
was
now
closed
to
them
and
the
lavatorrent
flowing
over
the
edge
of
the
granite
wall
began
to
pour
down
upon
the
beach
its
cataracts
of
fire
the
sublime
horror
of
this
spectacle
passed
all
description
during
the
night
it
could
only
be
compared
to
a
niagara
of
molten
fluid
with
its
incandescent
vapors
above
and
its
boiling
masses
below
the
colonists
were
driven
to
their
last
entrenchment
and
although
the
upper
seams
of
the
vessel
were
not
yet
calked
they
decided
to
launch
her
at
once
pencroft
and
ayrton
therefore
set
about
the
necessary
preparations
for
the
launching
which
was
to
take
place
the
morning
of
the
next
day
the
9th
of
march
but
during
the
night
of
the
8th
an
enormous
column
of
vapor
escaping
from
the
crater
rose
with
frightful
explosions
to
a
height
of
more
than
three
thousand
feet
the
wall
of
dakkar
grotto
had
evidently
given
way
under
the
pressure
of
gases
and
the
sea
rushing
through
the
central
shaft
into
the
igneous
gulf
was
at
once
converted
into
vapor
but
the
crater
could
not
afford
a
sufficient
outlet
for
this
vapor
an
explosion
which
might
have
been
heard
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
miles
shook
the
air
fragments
of
mountains
fell
into
the
pacific
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
ocean
rolled
over
the
spot
where
lincoln

stood

that

been
hurled
into
the

at
the
instant
when
the
fragments
of
the
island
rained
down
on
every
side
when
they
reached
the
surface
they
could
only
perceive
at
half
a
cables

this
mass
of
rocks
towards
which
they
swam

on

had
now
existed
for
nine
days
a

little
fresh

from

that

unfortunate
colonists
possessed

last
hope

been
shattered

pieces
they
had
no

it
seemed
that
they
must
inevitably
perish
this
day
the
18th
of

there
remained
only
provisions
for
two
days
although
they
limited
their
consumption
to
the
bare
necessaries
of

all
their
science

could

gideon

what
a
misfortune
what

captain

did
right
to
die
said
neb
during
the
five
ensuing
days
cyrus
harding
and
his
unfortunate
companions
husbanded
their
provisions
with
the
most
extreme
care
eating
only
what
would
prevent
them
from
dying
of
starvation
their
weakness
was
extreme
herbert
and
neb
began
to
show
symptoms
of
delirium
under
these
circumstances
was
it
possible
for
them
to
retain
even
the
shadow
of
a
hope
no
what
was
their
sole
remaining
chance
that
a
vessel
should
appear
in
sight
of
the
rock
but
they
knew
only
too
well
from
experience
that
no
ships
ever
visited
this
part
of
the
pacific
could
they
calculate
that
by
a
truly
providential
coincidence
the
scotch
yacht
would
arrive
precisely
at
this
time
in
search
of
ayrton
at
tabor
island
it
was
scarcely
probable
and
besides
supposing
she
should
come
there
as
the
colonists
had
not
been
able
to
deposit
a
notice
pointing
out
ayrtons
change
of
abode
the
commander
of
the
yacht
after
having
explored
tabor
island
without
results
would
again
set
sail
and
return
to
lower
latitudes
no
no
hope
of
being
saved
could
be
retained
and
a
horrible
death
death
from
hunger
and
thirst
awaited
them
upon
this
rock
already
they
were
stretched
on
the
rock
inanimate
and
no
longer
conscious
of
what
passed
around
them
ayrton
alone
by
a
supreme
effort
from
time
to
time
raised
his
head
and
cast
a
despairing
glance
over
the
desert
ocean
but
on
the
morning
of
the
24th
of
march
ayrtons
arms
were
extended
toward
a
point
in
the
horizon
he
raised
himself
at
first
on
his
knees
then
upright
and
his
hand
seemed
to
make
a
signal
a
sail
was
in
sight
off
the
rock
she
was
evidently
not
without
an
object
the
reef
was
the
mark
for
which
she
was
making
in
a
direct
line
under
all
steam
and
the
unfortunate
colonists
might
have
made
her
out
some
hours
before
if
they
had
had
the
strength
to
watch
the
horizon
the
duncan
murmured
ayrtonand
fell
back
without
sign
of
life
when
cyrus
harding
and
his
companions
recovered
consciousness
thanks
to
the
attention
lavished
upon
them
they
found
themselves
in
the
cabin
of
a
steamer
without
being
able
to
comprehend
how
they
had
escaped
death
a
word
from
ayrton
explained
everything
the
duncan
he
murmured
the
duncan
exclaimed
cyrus
harding
and
raising
his
hand
to
heaven
he
said
oh
almighty
god
mercifully
hast
thou
preserved
us
it
was
in
fact
the
duncan
lord
glenarvans
yacht
now
commanded
by
robert
son
of
captain
grant
who
had
been
despatched
to
tabor
island
to
find
ayrton
and
bring
him
back
to
his
native
land
after
twelve
years
of
expiation
the
colonists
were
not
only
saved
but
already
on
the
way
to
their
native
country
captain
grant
asked
cyrus
harding
who
can
have
suggested
to
you
the
idea
after
having
left
tabor
island
where
you
did
not
find
ayrton
of
coming
a
hundred
miles
farther
northeast
captain
harding
replied
robert
grant
it
was
in
order
to
find
not
only
ayrton
but
yourself
and
your
companions
my
companions
and
myself
doubtless
at
lincoln
island
at
lincoln
island
exclaimed
in
a
breath
gideon
spilett
herbert
neb
and
pencroft
in
the
highest
degree
astonished
how
could
you
be
aware
of
the
existence
of
lincoln
island
inquired
cyrus
harding
it
is
not
even
named
in
the
charts
i
knew
of
it
from
a
document
left
by
you
on
tabor
island
answered
robert
grant
a
document
cried
gideon
spilett
without
doubt
and
here
it
is
answered
robert
grant
producing
a
paper
which
indicated
the
longitude
and
latitude
of
lincoln
island
the
present
residence
of
ayrton
and
five
american
colonists
it
is
captain
nemo
cried
cyrus
harding
after
having
read
the
notice
and
recognized
that
the
handwriting
was
similar
to
that
of
the
paper
found
at
the
corral
ah
said
pencroft
it
was
then
he
who
took
our
bonadventure
and
hazarded
himself
alone
to
go
to
tabor
island
in
order
to
leave
this
notice
added
herbert
i
was
then
right
in
saying
exclaimed
the
sailor
that
even
after
his
death
the
captain
would
render
us
a
last
service
my
friends
said
cyrus
harding
in
a
voice
of
the
profoundest
emotion
may
the
god
of
mercy
have
had
pity
on
the
soul
of
captain
nemo
our
benefactor
the
colonists
uncovered
themselves
at
these
last
words
of
cyrus
harding
and
murmured
the
name
of
captain
nemo
then
ayrton
approaching
the
engineer
said
simply
where
should
this
coffer
be
deposited
it
was
the
coffer
which
ayrton
had
saved
at
the
risk
of
his
life
at
the
very
instant
that
the
island
had
been
engulfed
and
which
he
now
faithfully
handed
to
the
engineer
ayrton
ayrton
said
cyrus
harding
deeply
touched
then
addressing
robert
grant
sir
he
added
you
left
behind
you
a
criminal
you
find
in
his
place
a
man
who
has
become
honest
by
penitence
and
whose
hand
i
am
proud
to
clasp
in
mine
robert
grant
was
now
made
acquainted
with
the
strange
history
of
captain
nemo
and
the
colonists
of
lincoln
island
then
observation
being
taken
of
what
remained
of
this
shoal
which
must
henceforward
figure
on
the
charts
of
the
pacific
the
order
was
given
to
make
all
sail
a
few
weeks
afterwards
the
colonists
landed
in
america
and
found
their
country
once
more
at
peace
after
the
terrible
conflict
in
which
right
and
justice
had
triumphed
of
the
treasures
contained
in
the
coffer
left
by
captain
nemo
to
the
colonists
of
lincoln
island
the
larger
portion
was
employed
in
the
purchase
of
a
vast
territory
in
the
state
of
iowa
one
pearl
alone
the
finest
was
reserved
from

sent
to

glenarvan
in
the
name
of
the
castaways
restored
to
their
country
by
the
duncan
there
upon
this
domain
the

invited
to
labor
that

to
wealth
and
happiness
all
those
to
whom
they
had

to
offer
the
hospitality

there
was
founded
a
vast
colony

the

arrived

that
island

during
four
years
