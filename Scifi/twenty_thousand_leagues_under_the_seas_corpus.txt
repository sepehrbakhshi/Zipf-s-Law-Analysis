this

to
explain
the
dark
power

otherworldly
fascination
of
twenty
thousand

under
the

born
in
the
french
river

passion
for

as

as
a
celebrated

he
went
on
frequent
voyagesto

america

mediterranean
but
the
specific
stimulus
for
this
novel
was
an
1865
fan
letter
from
a
fellow
writer
madame
george
sand
she
praised
vernes
two
early
novels

beneath
the

to

a
unique
form
of
guerilla

initially
vernes
narrative
was
influenced
by
the
1863
uprising
of
poland
against
tsarist
russia
the
poles
were
quashed
with
a
violence
that
appalled
not

verne

a

the
1860s
france
had
to
treat

with

the
operative
word
is

these

partly
apply
here
the
subtitle
of
the
present
book

almost
at

yet
this
loose
structure
gives
the
novel
an
air
of
documentary
realism
whats
more
verne
adds
backbone
to
the
action
by
developing
three
recurring
motifs
the
deepening
mystery
of
nemos
past
life
and
future
intentions
the
mounting
tension
between
nemo
and
hottempered
harpooner
ned
land
and
neds
ongoing
schemes
to
escape
from
the
nautilus
these
unifying
threads
tighten
the
narrative
and
accelerate
its
momentum
other
subtleties
occur
inside
each
episode
the
textures
sparkling
with
wit
information
and

verne
regards
the

the
domain
of

in

swirl

he
studies
volcanoes
literally

he
celebrates
the

entrepreneurs
who
lay

and
vernes

proves
especially
authoritative
his
specifications
for
an
opensea
submarine
and
a
selfcontained
diving
suit
were
decades
before
their
time

a
runaway
reef
the
year
1866
was
marked
by
a
bizarre
development
an
unexplained
and
downright
inexplicable
phenomenon
that
surely
no
one
has
forgotten
without
getting
into
those
rumors
that
upset
civilians
in
the
seaports
and
deranged
the
public
mind
even
far
inland
it
must
be
said
that
professional
seamen
were
especially
alarmed
traders
shipowners
captains
of
vessels
skippers
and
master
mariners
from
europe
and
america
naval
officers
from
every
country
and
at
their
heels
the
various
national
governments
on
these
two
continents
were
all
extremely
disturbed
by
the
business
in
essence
over
a
period
of
time
several
ships
had
encountered
an
enormous
thing
at
sea
a
long
spindleshaped
object
sometimes
giving
off
a
phosphorescent
glow
infinitely
bigger
and
faster
than
any
whale
the
relevant
data
on
this
apparition
as
recorded
in
various
logbooks
agreed
pretty
closely
as
to
the
structure
of
the
object
or
creature
in
question
its
unprecedented
speed
of
movement
its
startling
locomotive
power
and
the
unique
vitality
with
which
it
seemed
to
be
gifted
if
it
was
a
cetacean
it
exceeded
in
bulk
any
whale
previously
classified
by
science
no
naturalist
neither
cuvier
nor
lacpde
neither
professor
dumeril
nor

would
have

the
existence

he
was
even
about
to
fix
its

position
when
two
waterspouts
shot
out
of
this
inexplicable
object
and
sprang
hissing
into
the
air
some
150
feet
so
unless
this
reef
was
subject
to
the
intermittent
eruptions
of
a

the

higginson
had
fair

similar

were
likewise
observed

this

transfer
itself
from

startling
swiftness
since
within
an
interval
of
just
three
days
the
governor
higginson
and
the
christopher
columbus
had
observed
it

happened
around
five

just

underwater
rock
or
the
wreckage
of
some
enormous
derelict

they
were
unable
to
say
but
when
they
examined

undersides
in

they
discovered
that

to
the
reputation
of
the
company
to
which
this

belonged
the
event
caused
an
immense
uproar
no
one
is
unaware
of
the
name
of
that
famous
english
shipowner

in

this
shrewd
industrialist
founded
a

400horsepower

and
a
burden
of
1162
metric
tons
eight

later
the
companys

were
increased
by
four
650horsepower
ships
at
1820
metric
tons
and
in
two
more
years
by
two
other
vessels
of
still
greater
power
and
tonnage
in
1853

the

it

it

under
the
thrust
of
its
1000horsepower
engines
its
paddle

were
churning
the

with
perfect
steadiness
it

then
drawing
67
meters

and
displacing
6624
cubic

at

in
the
afternoon
during
a
high
tea
for
passengers
gathered
in
the
main
lounge
a
collision
occurred
scarcely
noticeable
on
the
whole
affecting
the
scotias
hull
in
that
quarter
a
little
astern
of
its
port
paddle
wheel
the
scotia
hadnt
run
afoul
of
something
it
had
been
fouled
and
by
a
cutting
or
perforating
instrument
rather
than
a
blunt
one
this
encounter
seemed
so
minor
that
nobody
on
board
would
have
been
disturbed
by
it
had
it
not
been
for
the
shouts
of
crewmen
in
the
hold
who
climbed
on
deck
yelling
were
sinking
were
sinking
at
first
the
passengers
were
quite
frightened
but
captain
anderson
hastened
to
reassure
them
in
fact
there
could
be
no
immediate
danger
divided
into
seven
compartments
by
watertight
bulkheads
the
scotia
could
brave
any
leak
with
impunity
captain
anderson
immediately
made
his
way
into
the
hold
he
discovered
that
the
fifth
compartment
had
been
invaded
by
the
sea
and
the
speed
of
this
invasion
proved
that
the
leak
was
considerable
fortunately
this
compartment
didnt
contain
the
boilers
because
their
furnaces
would
have
been
abruptly
extinguished
captain
anderson
called
an
immediate
halt
and
one
of
his
sailors
dived
down
to
assess
the
damage
within
moments
they
had
located
a
hole
two
meters
in
width
on
the
steamers
underside
such
a
leak
could
not
be
patched
and
with
its
paddle
wheels
half
swamped
the
scotia
had
no
choice
but
to
continue
its
voyage
by
then
it
lay
300
miles
from
cape
clear
and
after
three
days
of
delay
that
filled
liverpool
with
acute
anxiety
it
entered
the
company
docks
the
engineers
then
proceeded
to
inspect
the
scotia
which
had
been
put
in
dry
dock
they
couldnt
believe
their
eyes
two
and
a
half
meters
below
its
waterline
there
gaped
a
symmetrical
gash
in
the
shape
of
an
isosceles
triangle
this
breach
in
the
sheet
iron
was
so
perfectly
formed
no
punch
could
have
done
a
cleaner
job
of
it
consequently
it
must
have
been
produced
by
a
perforating
tool
of
uncommon
toughnessplus
after
being
launched
with
prodigious
power
and
then
piercing
four
centimeters
of

this
tool
had
needed
to
withdraw
itself
by
a
backward
motion
truly
inexplicable
this
was
the
last
straw
and
it
resulted

since
thanks
to

between
the

and
more

the
public
spoke
up
and

straight
out

at
all
cost
the

chapter
2
the
pros
and
cons
during
the
period
in
which
these
developments
were
occurring
i
had
returned
from
a
scientific
undertaking
organized
to
explore
the
nebraska
badlands
in
the
united
states
in
my
capacity
as
assistant
professor
at
the
paris
museum
of
natural
history
i
had
been
attached
to
this
expedition
by
the
french
government
after
spending
six
months
in
nebraska
i
arrived
in
new
york
laden
with
valuable
collections
near
the
end
of
march
my
departure
for
france
was
set
for
early
may
in
the
meantime
then
i
was
busy
classifying
my
mineralogical
botanical
and
zoological
treasures
when
that
incident
took
place
with
the
scotia
i
was
perfectly
abreast
of
this
question
which
was
the
big
news
of
the
day
and
how
could
i
not
have
been
i
had
read
and
reread
every
american
and
european
newspaper
without
being
any
farther
along
this
mystery
puzzled
me
finding
it
impossible
to
form
any
views
i
drifted
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
something
was
out
there
that
much
was
certain
and
any
doubting
thomas
was
invited
to
place
his
finger
on
the
scotias
wound
when
i
arrived
in
new
york
the
question
was
at
the
boiling
point
the
hypothesis
of
a
drifting
islet
or
an
elusive
reef
put
forward
by
people
not
quite
in
their
right
minds
was
completely
eliminated
and
indeed
unless
this
reef
had
an
engine
in
its
belly
how
could
it
move
about
with
such
prodigious
speed
also
discredited
was
the
idea
of
a
floating
hull
or
some
other
enormous
wreckage
and
again
because
of
this
speed
of
movement
so
only
two
possible
solutions
to
the
question
were
left
creating
two
very
distinct
groups
of
supporters
on
one
side
those
favoring
a
monster
of
colossal
strength
on
the
other
those
favoring
an
underwater
boat
of
tremendous
motor
power
now
then
although
the
latter
hypothesis
was
completely
admissible
it
couldnt
stand
up
to
inquiries
conducted
in
both
the
new
world
and
the
old
that
a
private
individual
had
such
a
mechanism
at
his
disposal
was
less
than
probable
where
and
when
had
he
built
it
and
how
could
he
have
built
it
in
secret
only
some
government
could
own
such
an
engine
of
destruction
and
in
these
disasterfilled
times
when
men
tax
their
ingenuity
to
build
increasingly
powerful
aggressive
weapons
it
was
possible
that
unknown
to
the
rest
of
the
world
some
nation
could
have
been
testing
such
a
fearsome
machine
the
chassepot
rifle
led
to
the
torpedo
and
the
torpedo
has
led
to
this
underwater
battering
ram
which
in
turn
will
lead
to
the
world
putting
its
foot
down
at
least
i
hope
it
will
but
this
hypothesis
of
a
war
machine
collapsed
in
the
face
of
formal
denials
from
the
various
governments
since
the
public
interest
was
at
stake
and
transoceanic
travel
was
suffering
the
sincerity
of
these
governments
could
not
be
doubted
besides
how
could
the
assembly
of
this
underwater
boat
have
escaped
public
notice
keeping
a
secret
under
such
circumstances
would
be
difficult
enough
for
an
individual
and
certainly
impossible
for
a
nation
whose
every
move
is
under
constant
surveillance
by
rival
powers
so
after
inquiries
conducted
in
england
france
russia
prussia
spain
italy
america
and
even
turkey
the
hypothesis
of
an
underwater
monitor
was
ultimately
rejected
and
so
the
monster
surfaced
again
despite
the
endless
witticisms
heaped
on
it
by
the
popular
press
and
the
human
imagination
soon
got
caught
up
in
the
most
ridiculous
ichthyological
fantasies
after
i
arrived
in
new
york
several
people
did
me
the
honor
of
consulting
me
on
the
phenomenon
in
question
in
france
i
had
published
a
twovolume
work
in
quarto
entitled
the
mysteries
of
the
great
ocean
depths
well
received
in
scholarly
circles
this
book
had
established
me
as
a
specialist
in
this
pretty
obscure
field
of
natural
history
my
views
were
in
demand
as
long
as
i
could
deny
the
reality
of
the
business
i
confined
myself
to
a
flat
no
comment
but
soon
pinned
to
the
wall
i
had
to
explain
myself
straight
out
and
in
this
vein
the
honorable
pierre
aronnax
professor
at
the
paris
museum
was
summoned
by
the
new
york
herald
to
formulate
his
views
no
matter
what
i
complied
since
i
could
no
longer
hold
my
tongue
i
let
it
wag
i
discussed
the
question
in
its
every
aspect
both
political
and
scientific
and
this
is
an
excerpt
from
the
wellpadded
article
i
published
in
the
issue
of
april
30
therefore
i
wrote
after
examining
these
different
hypotheses
one
by
one
we
are
forced
every
other
supposition
having
been
refuted
to
accept
the
existence
of
an
extremely
powerful
marine
animal
the
deepest
parts
of
the
ocean
are
totally
unknown
to
us
no
soundings
have
been
able
to
reach
them
what
goes
on
in
those
distant
depths
what
creatures
inhabit
or
could
inhabit
those
regions
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
what
is
the
constitution
of
these
animals
its
almost
beyond
conjecture
however
the
solution
to
this
problem
submitted
to
me
can
take
the
form
of
a
choice
between
two
alternatives
either
we
know
every
variety
of
creature
populating
our
planet
or
we
do
not
if
we
do
not
know
every
one
of
them
if
nature
still
keeps
ichthyological
secrets
from
us
nothing
is
more
admissible
than
to
accept
the
existence
of
fish
or
cetaceans
of
new
species
or
even
new
genera
animals
with
a
basically
castiron
constitution
that
inhabit
strata
beyond
the
reach
of
our
soundings
and
which
some
development
or
other
an
urge
or
a
whim
if
you
prefer
can
bring
to
the
upper
level
of
the
ocean
for
long
intervals
if
on
the
other
hand
we
do
know
every
living
species
we
must
look
for
the
animal
in
question
among
those
marine
creatures
already
cataloged
and
in
this
event
i
would
be
inclined
to
accept
the
existence
of
a
giant
narwhale
the
common
narwhale
or
sea
unicorn
often
reaches
a
length
of
sixty
feet
increase
its
dimensions
fivefold
or
even
tenfold
then
give
this
cetacean
a
strength
in
proportion
to
its
size
while
enlarging
its
offensive
weapons
and
you
have
the
animal
were
looking
for
it
would
have
the
proportions
determined
by
the
officers
of
the
shannon
the
instrument
needed
to
perforate
the
scotia
and
the
power
to
pierce
a
steamers
hull
in
essence
the
narwhale
is
armed
with
a
sort
of
ivory
sword
or
lance
as
certain
naturalists
have
expressed
it
its
a
kingsized
tooth
as
hard
as
steel
some
of
these
teeth
have
been
found
buried
in
the
bodies
of
baleen
whales
which
the
narwhale
attacks
with
invariable
success
others
have
been
wrenched
not
without
difficulty
from
the
undersides
of
vessels
that
narwhales
have
pierced
clean
through
as
a
gimlet
pierces
a
wine
barrel
the
museum
at
the
faculty
of
medicine
in
paris
owns
one
of
these
tusks
with
a
length
of
225
meters
and
a
width
at
its
base
of
fortyeight
centimeters
all
right
then
imagine
this
weapon
to
be
ten
times
stronger
and
the
animal
ten
times
more
powerful
launch
it
at
a
speed
of
twenty
miles
per
hour
multiply
its
mass
times
its
velocity
and
you
get
just
the
collision
we
need
to
cause
the
specified
catastrophe
so
until
information
becomes
more
abundant
i
plump
for
a
sea
unicorn
of
colossal
dimensions
no
longer
armed
with
a
mere
lance
but
with
an
actual
spur
like
ironclad
frigates
or
those
warships
called
rams
whose
mass
and
motor
power
it
would
possess
simultaneously
this
inexplicable
phenomenon
is
thus
explained
awayunless
its
something
else
entirely
which
despite
everything
that
has
been
sighted
studied
explored
and
experienced
is
still
possible
these
last
words
were
cowardly
of
me
but
as
far
as
i
could
i
wanted
to
protect
my
professorial
dignity
and
not
lay
myself
open
to
laughter
from
the
americans
who
when
they
do
laugh
laugh
raucously
i
had
left
myself
a
loophole
yet
deep
down
i
had
accepted
the
existence
of
the
monster
my
article
was
hotly
debated
causing
a
fine
old
uproar
it
rallied
a
number
of
supporters
moreover
the
solution
it
proposed
allowed
for
free
play
of
the
imagination
the
human
mind
enjoys
impressive
visions
of
unearthly
creatures
now
then
the
sea
is
precisely
their
best
medium
the
only
setting
suitable
for
the
breeding
and
growing
of
such
giantsnext
to
which
such
land
animals
as
elephants
or
rhinoceroses
are
mere
dwarves
the
liquid
masses
support
the
largest
known
species
of
mammals
and
perhaps
conceal
mollusks
of
incomparable
size
or
crustaceans
too
frightful
to
contemplate
such
as
100meter
lobsters
or
crabs
weighing
200
metric
tons
why
not
formerly
in
prehistoric
days
land
animals
quadrupeds
apes
reptiles
birds
were
built
on
a
gigantic
scale
our
creator
cast
them
using
a
colossal
mold
that
time
has
gradually
made
smaller
with
its
untold
depths
couldnt
the
sea
keep
alive
such
huge
specimens
of
life
from
another
age
this
sea
that
never
changes
while
the
land
masses
undergo
almost
continuous
alteration
couldnt
the
heart
of
the
ocean
hide
the
lastremaining
varieties
of
these
titanic
species
for
whom
years
are
centuries
and
centuries
millennia
but
i
mustnt
let
these
fantasies
run
away
with
me
enough
of
these
fairy
tales
that
time
has
changed
for
me
into
harsh
realities
i
repeat
opinion
had
crystallized
as
to
the
nature
of
this
phenomenon
and
the
public
accepted
without
argument
the
existence
of
a
prodigious
creature
that
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
fabled
sea
serpent
yet
if
some
saw
it
purely
as
a
scientific
problem
to
be
solved
more
practical
people
especially
in
america
and
england
were
determined
to
purge
the
ocean
of
this
daunting
monster
to
insure
the
safety
of
transoceanic
travel
the
industrial
and
commercial
newspapers
dealt
with
the
question
chiefly
from
this
viewpoint
the
shipping

mercantile
gazette
the
lloyds
list
frances
packetboat
and
maritime

colonial
review
all
the
rags
devoted
to
insurance
companieswho
threatened
to
raise
their
premium
rateswere
unanimous
on
this
point
public
opinion
being
pronounced
the
states
of
the
union
were
the
first
in
the
field
in
new
york
preparations
were
under
way
for
an
expedition
designed
to
chase
this
narwhale
a
highspeed
frigate
the
abraham
lincoln
was
fitted
out
for
putting
to
sea
as
soon
as
possible
the
naval
arsenals
were
unlocked
for
commander
farragut
who
pressed
energetically
forward
with
the
arming
of
his
frigate
but
as
it
always
happens
just
when
a
decision
had
been
made
to
chase
the
monster
the
monster
put
in
no
further
appearances
for
two
months
nobody
heard
a
word
about
it
not
a
single
ship
encountered
it
apparently
the
unicorn
had
gotten
wise
to
these
plots
being
woven
around
it
people
were
constantly
babbling
about
the
creature
even
via
the
atlantic
cable
accordingly
the
wags
claimed
that
this
slippery
rascal
had
waylaid
some
passing
telegram
and
was
making
the
most
of
it
so
the
frigate
was
equipped
for
a
faroff
voyage
and
armed
with
fearsome
fishing
gear
but
nobody
knew
where
to
steer
it
and
impatience
grew
until
on
june
2
word
came
that
the
tampico
a
steamer
on
the
san
francisco
line
sailing
from
california
to
shanghai
had
sighted
the
animal
again
three
weeks
before
in
the
northerly
seas
of
the
pacific
this
news
caused
intense
excitement
not
even
a
24hour
breather
was
granted
to
commander
farragut
his
provisions
were
loaded
on
board
his
coal
bunkers
were
overflowing
not
a
crewman
was
missing
from
his
post
to
cast
off
he
needed
only
to
fire
and
stoke
his
furnaces
half
a
days
delay
would
have
been
unforgivable
but
commander
farragut

master
wishes
three
seconds
before
the
arrival
of
j
b
hobsons
letter
i
no
more
dreamed
of
chasing
the
unicorn
than
of
trying
for
the
northwest
passage
three
seconds
after
reading
this
letter
from
the
honorable
secretary
of
the
navy
i
understood
at
last
that
my
true
vocation
my
sole
purpose
in
life
was
to
hunt
down
this
disturbing
monster
and
rid
the
world
of
it
even
so
i
had
just
returned
from
an
arduous
journey
exhausted
and
badly
needing
a
rest
i
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
see
my
country
again
my
friends
my
modest
quarters
by
the
botanical
gardens
my
dearly
beloved
collections
but
now
nothing
could
hold
me
back
i
forgot
everything
else
and
without
another
thought
of
exhaustion
friends
or
collections
i
accepted
the
american
governments
offer
besides
i
mused
all
roads
lead
home
to
europe
and
our
unicorn
may
be
gracious
enough
to
take
me
toward
the
coast
of
france
that
fine
animal
may
even
let
itself
be
captured
in
european
seasas
a
personal
favor
to
meand
ill
bring
back
to
the
museum
of
natural
history
at
least
half
a
meter
of
its
ivory
lance
but
in
the
meantime
i
would
have
to
look
for
this
narwhale
in
the
northern
pacific
ocean
which
meant
returning
to
france
by
way
of
the
antipodes
conseil
i
called
in
an
impatient
voice
conseil
was
my
manservant
a
devoted
lad
who
went
with
me
on
all
my
journeys
a
gallant
flemish
boy
whom
i
genuinely
liked
and
who
returned
the
compliment
a
born
stoic
punctilious
on
principle
habitually
hardworking
rarely
startled
by
lifes
surprises
very
skillful
with
his
hands
efficient
in
his
every
duty
and
despite
his
having
a
name
that
means
counsel
never
giving
advicenot
even
the
unsolicited
kind
from
rubbing
shoulders
with
scientists
in
our
little
universe
by
the
botanical
gardens
the
boy
had
come
to
know
a
thing
or
two
in
conseil
i
had
a
seasoned
specialist
in
biological
classification
an
enthusiast
who
could
run
with
acrobatic
agility
up
and
down
the
whole
ladder
of
branches
groups
classes
subclasses
orders
families
genera
subgenera
species
and
varieties
but
there
his
science
came
to
a
halt
classifying
was
everything
to
him
so
he
knew
nothing
else
well
versed
in
the
theory
of
classification
he
was
poorly
versed
in
its
practical
application
and
i
doubt
that
he
could
tell
a
sperm
whale
from
a
baleen
whale
and
yet
what
a
fine
gallant
lad
for
the
past
ten
years
conseil
had
gone
with
me
wherever
science
beckoned
not
once
did
he
comment
on
the
length
or
the
hardships
of
a
journey
never
did
he
object
to
buckling
up
his
suitcase
for
any
country
whatever
china
or
the
congo
no
matter
how
far
off
it
was
he
went
here
there
and
everywhere
in
perfect
contentment
moreover
he
enjoyed
excellent
health
that
defied
all
ailments
owned
solid
muscles
but
hadnt
a
nerve
in
him
not
a
sign
of
nervesthe
mental
type
i
mean
the
lad
was
thirty
years
old
and
his
age
to
that
of
his
employer
was
as
fifteen
is
to
twenty
please
forgive
me
for
this
underhanded
way
of
admitting
i
had
turned
forty
but
conseil
had
one
flaw
he
was
a
fanatic
on
formality
and
he
only
addressed
me
in
the
third
personto
the
point
where
it
got
tiresome
conseil
i
repeated
while
feverishly
beginning
my
preparations
for
departure
to
be
sure
i
had
confidence
in
this
devoted
lad
ordinarily
i
never
asked
whether
or
not
it
suited
him
to
go
with
me
on
my
journeys
but
this
time
an
expedition
was
at
issue
that
could
drag
on
indefinitely
a
hazardous
undertaking
whose
purpose
was
to
hunt
an
animal
that
could
sink
a
frigate
as
easily
as
a
walnut
shell
there
was
good
reason
to
stop
and
think
even
for
the
worlds
most
emotionless
man
what
would
conseil
say
conseil
i
called
a
third
time
conseil
appeared
did
master
summon
me
he
said
entering
yes
my
boy

my
things
ready
get
yours
ready
were
departing
in
two
hours
as

conseil
replied
serenely
we
havent
a
moment
to
lose
pack
as
much
into
my
trunk
as
you
can
my
traveling
kit
my
suits

dont
bother
counting
just
squeeze
it
all
inand
hurry
what
about
masters

conseil
ventured
to
observe
well
deal
with
them
later
what
the

hyracotherium
oreodonts
cheiropotamus
and

we
arent
returning
to
paris
conseil
asked
yes
we
are



certainly




i
replied
evasively
but
after
we
make
a
detour
whatever
detour
master
wishes
oh
its
nothing
really
a
route
slightly
less
direct
thats
all
were
leaving
on
the
abraham
lincoln
as

placidly
you

my

has
no
excuse
for
not
setting
sail
with
commander
farragut
its
a
glorious
mission
but
also
a
dangerous
one
we
dont
know
where
it
will
take
us
these
beasts
can
be
quite
unpredictable
but
were
going
just
the
same
we
have
a
commander
whos
game
for
anything
what
master
does
ill
do
conseil
replied
but
think
it
over
because
i
dont
want
to
hide
anything
from
you
this
is
one
of
those
voyages
from

dont

come
back

wishes
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
our
trunks
were
ready
conseil
did
them
in
a
flash
and
i
was
sure
the
lad
hadnt
missed
a
thing
because
he
classified
shirts
and
suits
as
expertly
as
birds
and
mammals
the
hotel
elevator
dropped
us
off
in
the
main
vestibule
on
the
mezzanine
i
went
down
a
short
stair
leading
to
the
ground
floor
i
settled
my
bill
at
that
huge
counter
that
was
always
under
siege
by
a
considerable
crowd
i
left
instructions
for
shipping
my
containers
of
stuffed
animals
and
dried
plants
to
paris
france
i
opened
a
line
of
credit
sufficient
to
cover
the
babirusa
and
conseil
at
my
heels
i
jumped
into
a
carriage
for
a
fare
of
twenty
francs
the
vehicle
went
down
broadway
to
union
square
took
fourth
ave
to
its
junction
with
bowery
st
turned
into
katrin
st
and
halted
at
pier

there
the
katrin
ferry
transferred
men
horses
and
carriage
to
brooklyn
that
great
new
york
annex
located
on
the
left
bank
of
the
east
river
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
arrived
at
the
wharf
next
to
which
the
abraham
lincoln
was
vomiting
torrents
of
black
smoke
from
its
two
funnels
our
baggage
was
immediately
carried
to
the
deck
of
the
frigate
i
rushed
aboard
i
asked
for
commander
farragut
one
of
the
sailors
led
me
to
the
afterdeck
where
i
stood
in
the

of

smartlooking
officer
who
extended
his

me

he
said
to
me

i
replied
commander
farragut
in
person
welcome
aboard
professor
your
cabin
is
waiting
for
you
i
bowed
and
letting
the

attend
to
getting
under
way
i
was
taken
to
the
cabin
that
had
been
set
aside
for
me
the
abraham
lincoln
had
been
perfectly
chosen
and
fitted
out
for
its
new
assignment
it
was
a
highspeed
frigate
furnished
with
superheating
equipment
that
allowed
the
tension
of
its
steam
to
build
to
seven
atmospheres
under
this
pressure
the
abraham
lincoln
reached
an
average
speed
of
183
miles
per
hour
a
considerable
speed
but
still
not
enough
to
cope
with
our
gigantic
cetacean
the
frigates
interior
accommodations
complemented
its
nautical

i
was
well
satisfied
with

was
located
in
the

as
comfortable
as

i
left

to
the

stowing

luggage
and
climbed
on
deck
to
watch
the
preparations
for
getting
under

just
then
commander

was
giving
orders
to
cast
off
the
last
moorings
holding

if

would

i
would
have
missed

on
this
unearthly
extraordinary
and
inconceivable
expedition
whose
true
story
might
well
meet
with
some
skepticism
but
commander
farragut
didnt
want
to
waste
a
single
day
or
even
a
single
hour
in

dieudonn
of

on
his
way
to
fight
an
encounter
with
the
dragon
devastating
the
island
either
commander
farragut
would
slay
the
narwhale
or
the
narwhale
would
slay
commander
farragut
no
middle
of
the
road
for
these
two
the
ships
officers
shared
the
views
of
their
leader
they
could
be
heard
chatting
discussing
arguing
calculating
the
different
chances
of
an
encounter
and
observing
the
vast
expanse
of
the
ocean
voluntary
watches
from
the
crosstrees
of
the
topgallant
sail
were
selfimposed
by
more
than
one
who
would
have
cursed
such
toil
under
any
other
circumstances
as
often
as
the
sun
swept
over
its
daily
arc
the
masts
were
populated
with
sailors
whose
feet
itched
and
couldnt
hold
still
on
the
planking
of
the
deck
below
and
the
abraham
lincolns
stempost
hadnt
even
cut
the
suspected
waters
of
the

as
for
the

they
only
wanted
to
encounter
the

harpoon
it
haul
it
on
board
and
carve
it
up
they
surveyed
the
sea
with
scrupulous
care
besides
commander
farragut
had
mentioned
that
a
certain
sum
of
200000
was
waiting
for
the
man
who
first

officer
ill
let
the
reader
decide
whether
eyes
got
proper
exercise
aboard
the
abraham
lincoln
as
for
me
i
didnt
lag
behind
the
others
and
i
yielded
to
no
one
my
share
in
these
daily
observations
our
frigate
would
have
had
fivescore
good
reasons
for
renaming
itself
the
argus
after
that
mythological
beast
with
100
eyes
the
lone
rebel
among
us
was
conseil
who
seemed
utterly
uninterested
in
the
question
exciting
us
and
was
out
of
step
with
the
general
enthusiasm
on
board
as
i
said
commander
farragut
had
carefully
equipped
his
ship
with
all
the
gear
needed
to
fish
for
a
gigantic
cetacean
no
whaling
vessel
could
have
been
better
armed
we
had
every
known
mechanism
from
the
handhurled
harpoon
to
the
blunderbuss
firing
barbed
arrows
to
the
duck
gun
with
exploding
bullets
on
the
forecastle
was
mounted
the
latest
model
breechloading
cannon
very
heavy
of
barrel
and
narrow
of
bore
a
weapon
that
would
figure
in
the
universal
exhibition
of
1867
made
in
america
this
valuable
instrument
could
fire
a
fourkilogram
conical
projectile
an
average
distance
of
sixteen
kilometers
without
the
least
bother
so
the
abraham
lincoln
wasnt
lacking
in
means
of
destruction
but
it
had
better
still
it
had
ned
land
the
king
of
harpooners
gifted
with
uncommon
manual
ability
ned
land
was
a
canadian
who
had
no
equal
in
his
dangerous
trade
dexterity
coolness
bravery
and
cunning
were
virtues
he
possessed
to
a
high
degree
and
it
took
a
truly
crafty
baleen
whale
or
an
exceptionally
astute
sperm
whale
to
elude
the
thrusts
of
his
harpoon
ned
land
was
about
forty
years
old
a
man
of
great
heightover
six
english
feethe
was
powerfully
built
serious
in
manner
not
very
sociable
sometimes
headstrong
and
quite
illtempered
when
crossed
his
looks
caught
the
attention
and
above
all
the
strength
of
his
gaze
which
gave
a
unique
emphasis
to
his
facial
appearance
commander
farragut
to
my
thinking
had
made
a
wise
move
in
hiring
on
this
man
with
his
eye
and
his
throwing
arm
he
was
worth
the
whole
crew
all
by
himself
i
can
do
no
better
than
to
compare
him
with
a
powerful
telescope
that
could
double
as
a
cannon
always
ready
to
fire
to
say
canadian
is
to
say
french
and
as
unsociable
as
ned
land
was
i
must
admit
he
took
a
definite
liking
to
me
no
doubt
it
was
my
nationality
that
attracted
him
it
was
an
opportunity
for
him
to
speak
and
for
me
to
hear
that
old
rabelaisian
dialect
still
used
in
some
canadian
provinces
the
harpooners
family
originated
in
quebec
and
they
were
already
a
line
of
bold
fishermen
back
in
the
days
when
this
town
still
belonged
to
france
little
by
little
ned
developed
a
taste
for
chatting
and
i
loved
hearing
the
tales
of
his
adventures
in
the
polar
seas
he
described
his
fishing
trips
and
his
battles
with
great
natural
lyricism
his
tales
took
on
the
form
of
an
epic
poem
and
i
felt
i
was
hearing
some
canadian
homer
reciting
his
iliad
of
the
high
arctic
regions
im
writing
of
this
bold
companion
as
i
currently
know
him
because
weve
become
old
friends
united
in
that
permanent
comradeship
born
and
cemented
during
only
the
most
frightful
crises
ah
my
gallant
ned
i
ask
only
to
live
100
years
more
the
longer
to
remember
you
and
now
what
were
ned
lands
views
on
this
question
of
a
marine
monster
i
must
admit
that
he
flatly
didnt
believe
in
the
unicorn
and
alone
on
board
he
didnt
share
the
general
conviction
he
avoided
even
dealing
with
the
subject
for
which
one
day
i
felt
compelled
to
take
him
to
task
during
the
magnificent
evening
of
june
25in
other
words
three
weeks
after
our
departurethe
frigate
lay
abreast
of
cabo
blanco
thirty
miles
to
leeward
of
the
coast
of
patagonia
we
had
crossed
the
tropic
of
capricorn
and
the
strait
of
magellan
opened
less
than
700
miles
to
the
south
before
eight
days
were
out
the
abraham
lincoln
would
plow
the
waves
of
the
pacific
seated
on
the
afterdeck
ned
land
and
i
chatted
about
one
thing
and
another
staring
at
that
mysterious
sea
whose
depths
to
this
day
are
beyond
the
reach
of
human
eyes
quite
naturally
i
led
our
conversation
around
to
the
giant
unicorn
and
i
weighed
our
expeditions
various
chances
for
success
or
failure
then
seeing
that
ned
just
let
me
talk
without
saying
much
himself
i
pressed
him
more
closely
ned
i
asked
him
how
can
you
still
doubt
the
reality
of
this
cetacean
were
after
do
you
have
any
particular
reasons
for
being
so
skeptical
the
harpooner
stared
at
me
awhile
before
replying
slapped
his
broad
forehead
in
one
of
his
standard
gestures
closed
his
eyes
as
if
to
collect
himself
and
finally
said
just
maybe
professor
aronnax
but
ned
youre
a
professional
whaler
a
man
familiar
with
all
the
great
marine
mammalsyour
mind
should
easily
accept
this
hypothesis
of
an
enormous
cetacean
and
you
ought
to
be
the
last
one
to
doubt
it
under
these
circumstances
thats
just
where
youre
mistaken
professor
ned
replied
the
common
man
may
still
believe
in
fabulous
comets
crossing
outer
space
or
in
prehistoric
monsters
living
at
the
earths
core
but
astronomers
and
geologists
dont
swallow
such
fairy
tales
its
the
same
with
whalers
ive
chased
plenty
of
cetaceans
ive
harpooned
a
good
number
ive
killed
several
but
no
matter
how
powerful
and
well
armed
they
were
neither
their
tails
or
their
tusks
could
puncture
the
sheetiron
plates
of
a
steamer
even
so
ned
people
mention
vessels
that
narwhale
tusks
have
run
clean
through
wooden
ships
maybe
the
canadian
replied
but
ive
never
seen
the
like
so
till
i
have
proof
to
the
contrary
ill
deny
that
baleen
whales
sperm
whales
or
unicorns
can
do
any
such
thing
listen
to
me
ned
no
no
professor
ill
go
along
with
anything
you
want
except
that
some
gigantic
devilfish
maybe




even
less
likely
ned
the
devilfish
is
merely
a
mollusk
and
even
this
name
hints
at
its
semiliquid
flesh
because
its
latin
meaning
soft
one
the
devilfish
doesnt
belong
to
the
vertebrate
branch
and
even
if
it
were
500
feet
long
it
would
still
be
utterly
harmless
to
ships
like
the
scotia
or
the
abraham
lincoln
consequently
the
feats
of
krakens
or
other
monsters
of
that
ilk
must
be
relegated
to
the
realm
of
fiction
so
mr
naturalist
ned
land
continued
in
a
bantering
tone
youll
just
keep
on
believing
in
the
existence
of
some
enormous
cetacean




yes
ned
i
repeat
it
with
a
conviction
backed
by
factual
logic
i
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
mammal
with
a
powerful
constitution
belonging
to
the
vertebrate
branch
like
baleen
whales
sperm
whales
or
dolphins
and
armed
with
a
tusk
made
of
horn
that
has
tremendous
penetrating
power
humph
the
harpooner
put
in
shaking
his
head
with
the
attitude
of
a
man
who
doesnt
want
to
be
convinced
note
well
my
fine
canadian
i
went
on
if
such
an
animal
exists
if
it
lives
deep
in
the
ocean
if
it
frequents
the
liquid
strata
located
miles
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
it
needs
to
have
a
constitution
so
solid
it
defies
all
comparison
and
why
this
powerful
constitution
ned
asked
because
it
takes
incalculable
strength
just
to
live
in
those
deep
strata
and
withstand
their
pressure
oh
really
ned
said
tipping
me
a
wink
oh
really
and
i
can
prove
it
to
you
with
a
few
simple
figures
bosh
ned
replied
you
can
make
figures
do
anything
you
want
in
business
ned
but
not
in
mathematics
listen
to
me
lets
accept
that
the
pressure
of
one
atmosphere
is
represented
by
the
pressure
of
a
column
of
water
thirtytwo
feet
high
in
reality
such
a
column
of
water
wouldnt
be
quite
so
high
because
here
were
dealing
with
salt
water
which
is
denser
than
fresh
water
well
then
when
you
dive
under
the
waves
ned
for
every
thirtytwo
feet
of
water
above
you
your
body
is
tolerating
the
pressure
of
one
more
atmosphere
in
other
words
one
more
kilogram
per
each
square
centimeter
on
your
bodys
surface
so
it
follows
that
at
320
feet
down
this
pressure
is
equal
to
ten
atmospheres
to
100
atmospheres
at
3200
feet
and
to
1000
atmospheres
at
32000
feet
that
is
at
about
two
and
a
half
vertical
leagues
down
which
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
if
you
could
reach
such
a
depth
in
the
ocean
each
square
centimeter
on
your
bodys
surface
would
be
experiencing
1000
kilograms
of
pressure
now
my
gallant
ned
do
you
know
how
many
square
centimeters
you
have
on
your
bodily
surface
i
havent
the
foggiest
notion
professor
aronnax
about
17000
as
many
as
that
yes
and
since
the
atmospheres
pressure
actually
weighs
slightly
more
than
one
kilogram
per
square
centimeter
your
17000
square
centimeters
are
tolerating
17568
kilograms
at
this
very
moment
without
my
noticing
it
without
your
noticing
it
and
if
you
arent
crushed
by
so
much
pressure
its
because
the
air
penetrates
the
interior
of
your
body
with
equal
pressure
when
the
inside
and
outside
pressures
are
in
perfect
balance
they
neutralize
each
other
and
allow
you
to
tolerate
them
without
discomfort
but
in
the
water
its
another
story
yes
i
see
ned
replied
growing
more
interested
because
the
water
surrounds
me
but
doesnt
penetrate
me
precisely
ned
so
at
thirtytwo
feet
beneath
the
surface
of
the
sea
youll
undergo
a
pressure
of
17568
kilograms
at
320
feet
or
ten
times
greater
pressure
its
175680
kilograms
at
3200
feet
or
100
times
greater
pressure
its
1756800
kilograms
finally
at
32000
feet
or
1000
times
greater
pressure
its
17568000
kilograms
in
other
words
youd
be
squashed
as
flat
as
if
youd
just
been
yanked
from
between
the
plates
of
a
hydraulic
press
fire
and
brimstone
ned
put
in
all
right
then
my
fine
harpooner
if
vertebrates
several
hundred
meters
long
and
proportionate
in
bulk
live
at
such
depths
their
surface
areas
make
up
millions
of
square
centimeters
and
the
pressure
they
undergo
must
be
assessed
in
billions
of
kilograms
calculate
then
how
much
resistance
of
bone
structure
and
strength
of
constitution
theyd
need
in
order
to
withstand
such
pressures
theyd
need
to
be
manufactured
ned
land
replied
from
sheetiron
plates
eight
inches
thick
like
ironclad
frigates
right
ned
and
then
picture
the
damage
such
a
mass
could
inflict
if
it
were
launched
with
the
speed
of
an
express
train
against
a
ships
hull
yes



indeed



maybe
the
canadian
replied
staggered
by
these
figures
but
still
not
willing
to
give
in
well
have
i
convinced
you
youve
convinced
me
of
one
thing
mr
naturalist
that
deep
in
the
sea
such
animals
would
need
to
be
just
as
strong
as
you
sayif
they
exist
but
if
they
dont
exist
my
stubborn
harpooner
how
do
you
explain
the
accident
that
happened
to
the
scotia
its
maybe




ned
said
hesitating
go
on
because



it
just
couldnt
be
true
the
canadian
replied
unconsciously
echoing
a
famous
catchphrase
of
the
scientist
arago
but
this
reply
proved
nothing
other
than
how
bullheaded
the
harpooner
could
be
that
day
i
pressed
him
no
further
the
scotias
accident
was
undeniable
its
hole
was
real
enough
that
it
had
to
be
plugged
up
and
i
dont
think
a
holes
existence
can
be
more
emphatically
proven
now
then
this
hole
didnt
make
itself
and
since
it
hadnt
resulted
from
underwater
rocks
or
underwater
machines
it
must
have
been
caused
by
the
perforating
tool
of
some
animal
now
for
all
the
reasons
put
forward
to
this
point
i
believed
that
this
animal
was
a
member
of
the
branch
vertebrata
class
mammalia
group
pisciforma
and
finally
order
cetacea

for
the

genus
to
which
it
belonged
and
the

which
it
would
find
its
proper
home
these
questions
had
to
be
left
for
later
to
answer
them

chapter

at
random
for
some
while
the
voyage
of
the
abraham
lincoln
was
marked
by
no
incident
but
one
circumstance
arose
that
displayed
ned
lands
marvelous
skills
and
showed
just
how
much
confidence
we
could
place
in
him
off
the
falkland
islands
on
june
30
the
frigate
came
in
contact
with
a
fleet
of
american
whalers
and
we
learned
that
they
hadnt
seen
the
narwhale
but
one
of
them
the
captain
of
the
monroe
knew
that
ned
land
had
shipped
aboard
the
abraham
lincoln
and
asked
his
help
in
hunting
a
baleen
whale
that
was
in
sight
anxious
to
see
ned
land
at
work
commander
farragut
authorized
him
to
make
his
way
aboard
the
monroe
and
the
canadian
had
such
good
luck
that
with
a
rightandleft
shot
he
harpooned
not
one
whale
but
two
striking
the
first
straight
to
the
heart
and
catching
the
other
after
a
few
minutes
chase
assuredly
if
the
monster
ever
had
to
deal
with
ned
lands
harpoon
i
wouldnt
bet
on
the
monster
the
frigate
sailed
along
the
east
coast
of
south
america
with
prodigious
speed
by
july
3
we
were
at
the
entrance
to
the
strait
of
magellan
abreast
of
cabo
de
las
virgenes
but
commander
farragut
was
unwilling
to
attempt
this
tortuous
passageway
and
maneuvered
instead
to
double
cape
horn
the
crew
sided
with
him
unanimously
indeed
were
we
likely
to
encounter
the
narwhale
in
such
a
cramped
strait
many
of
our
sailors
swore
that
the
monster
couldnt
negotiate
this
passageway
simply
because
hes
too
big
for
it
near
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
on
july
6
fifteen
miles
south
of
shore
the
abraham
lincoln
doubled
that
solitary
islet
at
the
tip
of
the
south
american
continent
that
stray
rock
dutch
seamen
had
named
cape
horn
after
their
hometown
of
hoorn
our
course
was
set
for
the
northwest
and
the
next
day
our
frigates
propeller
finally
churned
the
waters
of
the
pacific
open
your
eyes
open
your
eyes
repeated
the
sailors
of
the
abraham
lincoln
and
they
opened
amazingly
wide
eyes
and
spyglasses
a
bit
dazzled
it
is
true
by
the
vista
of
200000
didnt
remain
at
rest
for
an
instant
day
and
night
we
observed
the
surface
of
the
ocean
and
those
with
nyctalopic
eyes
whose
ability
to
see
in
the
dark
increased
their
chances
by
fifty
percent
had
an
excellent
shot
at
winning
the
prize
as
for
me
i
was
hardly
drawn
by
the
lure
of
money
and
yet
was
far
from
the
least
attentive
on
board
snatching
only
a
few
minutes
for
meals
and
a
few
hours
for
sleep
come
rain
or
come
shine
i
no
longer
left
the
ships
deck
sometimes
bending
over
the
forecastle
railings
sometimes
leaning
against
the
sternrail
i
eagerly
scoured
that
cottoncolored
wake
that
whitened
the
ocean
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
and
how
many
times
i
shared
the
excitement
of
general
staff
and
crew
when
some
unpredictable
whale
lifted
its
blackish
back
above
the
waves
in
an
instant
the
frigates
deck
would
become
densely
populated
the
cowls
over
the
companionways
would
vomit
a
torrent
of
sailors
and
officers
with
panting
chests
and
anxious
eyes
we
each
would
observe
the
cetaceans
movements
i
stared
i
stared
until
i
nearly
went
blind
from
a
wornout
retina
while
conseil
as
stoic
as
ever
kept
repeating
to
me
in
a
calm
tone
if
masters
eyes
would
kindly
stop
bulging
master
will
see
farther
but
what
a
waste
of
energy
the
abraham
lincoln
would
change
course
and
race
after
the
animal
sighted
only
to
find
an
ordinary
baleen
whale
or
a
common
sperm
whale
that
soon
disappeared
amid
a
chorus
of
curses
however
the
weather
held
good
our
voyage
was
proceeding
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
by
then
it
was
the
bad
season
in
these
southernmost
regions
because
july
in
this
zone
corresponds
to
our
january
in
europe
but
the
sea
remained
smooth
and
easily
visible
over
a
vast
perimeter
ned
land
still
kept
up
the
most
tenacious
skepticism
beyond
his
spells
on
watch
he
pretended
that
he
never
even
looked
at
the
surface
of
the
waves
at
least
while
no
whales
were
in
sight
and
yet
the
marvelous
power
of
his
vision
could
have
performed
yeoman
service
but
this
stubborn
canadian
spent
eight
hours
out
of
every
twelve
reading
or
sleeping
in
his
cabin
a
hundred
times
i
chided
him
for
his
unconcern
bah
he
replied
nothings
out
there
professor
aronnax
and
if
there
is
some
animal
what
chance
would
we
have
of
spotting
it
cant
you
see
were
just
wandering
around
at
random
people
say
theyve
sighted
this
slippery
beast
again
in
the
pacific
high
seasim
truly
willing
to
believe
it
but
two
months
have
already
gone
by
since
then
and
judging
by
your
narwhales
personality
it
hates
growing
moldy
from
hanging
out
too
long
in
the
same
waterways
its
blessed
with
a
terrific
gift
for
getting
around
now
professor
you
know
even
better
than
i
that
nature
doesnt
violate
good
sense
and
she
wouldnt
give
some
naturally
slow
animal
the
ability
to
move
swiftly
if
it
hadnt
a
need
to
use
that
talent
so
if
the
beast
does
exist
its
already
long
gone
i
had
no
reply
to
this
obviously
we
were
just
groping
blindly
but
how
else
could
we
go
about
it
all
the
same
our
chances
were
automatically
pretty
limited
yet
everyone
still
felt
confident
of
success
and
not
a
sailor
on
board
would
have
bet
against
the
narwhale
appearing
and
soon
on
july
20
we
cut
the
tropic
of
capricorn
at
longitude
105
degrees
and
by
the
27th
of
the
same
month
we
had
cleared
the
equator
on
the
110th
meridian
these
bearings
determined
the
frigate
took
a
more
decisive
westward
heading
and
tackled
the
seas
of
the
central
pacific
commander
farragut
felt
and
with
good
reason
that
it
was
best
to
stay
in
deep
waters
and
keep
his
distance
from
continents
or
islands
whose
neighborhoods
the
animal
always
seemed
to
avoidno
doubt
our
bosun
said
because
there
isnt
enough
water
for
him
so
the
frigate
kept
well
out
when
passing
the
tuamotu
marquesas
and
hawaiian
islands
then
cut
the
tropic
of
cancer
at
longitude
132
degrees
and
headed
for
the
seas
of
china
we
were
finally
in
the
area
of
the
monsters
latest
antics
and
in
all
honesty
shipboard
conditions
became
lifethreatening
hearts
were
pounding
hideously
gearing
up
for
futures
full
of
incurable
aneurysms
the
entire
crew
suffered
from
a
nervous
excitement
that
its
beyond
me
to
describe
nobody
ate
nobody
slept
twenty
times
a
day
some
error
in
perception
or
the
optical
illusions
of
some
sailor
perched
in
the
crosstrees
would
cause
intolerable
anguish
and
this
emotion
repeated
twenty
times
over
kept
us
in
a
state
of
irritability
so
intense
that
a
reaction
was
bound
to
follow
and
this
reaction
wasnt
long
in
coming
for
three
months
during
which
each
day
seemed
like
a
century
the
abraham
lincoln
plowed
all
the
northerly
seas
of
the
pacific
racing
after
whales
sighted
abruptly
veering
off
course
swerving
sharply
from
one
tack
to
another
stopping
suddenly
putting
on
steam
and
reversing
engines
in
quick
succession
at
the
risk
of
stripping
its
gears
and
it
didnt
leave
a
single
point
unexplored
from
the
beaches
of
japan
to
the
coasts
of
america
and
we
found
nothing
nothing
except
an
immenseness
of
deserted
waves
nothing
remotely
resembling
a
gigantic
narwhale
or
an
underwater
islet
or
a
derelict
shipwreck
or
a
runaway
reef
or
anything
the
least
bit
unearthly
so
the
reaction
set
in
at
first
discouragement
took
hold
of
peoples
minds
opening
the
door
to
disbelief
a
new
feeling
appeared
on
board
made
up
of
threetenths
shame
and
seventenths
fury
the
crew
called
themselves
outandout
fools
for
being
hoodwinked
by
a
fairy
tale
then
grew
steadily
more
furious
the
mountains
of
arguments
amassed
over
a
year
collapsed
all
at
once
and
each
man
now
wanted
only
to
catch
up
on
his
eating
and
sleeping
to
make
up
for
the
time
he
had
so
stupidly
sacrificed
with
typical
human
fickleness
they
jumped
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
inevitably
the
most
enthusiastic
supporters
of
the
undertaking
became
its
most
energetic
opponents
this
reaction
mounted
upward
from
the
bowels
of
the
ship
from
the
quarters
of
the
bunker
hands
to
the
messroom
of
the
general
staff
and
for
certain
if
it
hadnt
been
for
commander
farraguts
characteristic
stubbornness
the
frigate
would
ultimately
have
put
back
to
that
cape
in
the
south
but
this
futile
search
couldnt
drag
on
much
longer
the
abraham
lincoln
had
done
everything
it
could
to
succeed
and
had
no
reason
to
blame
itself
never
had
the
crew
of
an
american
naval
craft
shown
more
patience
and
zeal
they
werent
responsible
for
this
failure
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
home
a
request
to
this
effect
was
presented
to
the
commander
the
commander
stood
his
ground
his
sailors
couldnt
hide
their
discontent
and
their
work
suffered
because
of
it
im
unwilling
to
say
that
there
was
mutiny
on
board
but
after
a
reasonable
period
of
intransigence
commander
farragut
like
christopher
columbus
before
him
asked
for
a
grace
period
of
just
three
days
more
after
this
threeday
delay
if
the
monster
hadnt
appeared
our
helmsman
would
give
three
turns
of
the
wheel
and
the
abraham
lincoln
would
chart
a
course
toward
european
seas
this
promise
was
given
on
november
2
it
had
the
immediate
effect
of
reviving
the
crews
failing
spirits
the
ocean
was
observed
with
renewed
care
each
man
wanted
one
last
look
with
which
to
sum
up
his
experience
spyglasses
functioned
with
feverish
energy
a
supreme
challenge
had
been
issued
to
the
giant
narwhale
and
the
latter
had
no
acceptable
excuse
for
ignoring
this
summons
to
appear
two
days
passed
the
abraham
lincoln
stayed
at
half
steam
on
the
offchance
that
the
animal
might
be
found
in
these
waterways
a
thousand
methods
were
used
to
spark
its
interest
or
rouse
it
from
its
apathy
enormous
sides
of
bacon
were
trailed
in
our
wake
to
the
great
satisfaction
i
must
say
of
assorted
sharks
while
the
abraham
lincoln
heaved
to
its
longboats
radiated
in
every
direction
around
it
and
didnt
leave
a
single
point
of
the
sea
unexplored
but
the
evening
of
november
4
arrived
with
this
underwater
mystery
still
unsolved
at
noon
the
next
day
november
5
the
agreedupon
delay
expired
after
a
position
fix
true
to
his
promise
commander
farragut
would
have
to
set
his
course
for
the
southeast
and
leave
the
northerly
regions
of
the
pacific
decisively
behind
by
then
the
frigate
lay
in
latitude
31
degrees
15
north
and
longitude
136
degrees
42
east
the
shores
of
japan
were
less
than
200
miles
to
our
leeward
night
was
coming
on
eight
oclock
had
just
struck
huge
clouds
covered
the
moons
disk
then
in
its
first
quarter
the
sea
undulated
placidly
beneath
the
frigates
stempost
just
then
i
was
in
the
bow
leaning
over
the
starboard
rail
conseil
stationed
beside
me
stared
straight
ahead
roosting
in
the
shrouds
the
crew
examined
the
horizon
which
shrank
and
darkened
little
by
little
officers
were
probing
the
increasing
gloom
with
their
night
glasses
sometimes
the
murky
ocean
sparkled
beneath
moonbeams
that
darted
between
the
fringes
of
two
clouds
then
all
traces
of
light
vanished
into
the
darkness
observing
conseil
i
discovered
that
just
barely
the
gallant
lad
had
fallen
under
the
general
influence
at
least
so
i
thought
perhaps
his
nerves
were
twitching
with
curiosity
for
the
first
time
in
history
come
on
conseil
i
told
him
heres
your
last
chance
to
pocket
that
200000
if
master
will
permit
my
saying
so
conseil
replied
i
never
expected
to
win
that
prize
and
the
union
government
could
have
promised
10000000
and
been
none
the
poorer
youre
right
conseil
it
turned
out
to
be
a
foolish
business
after
all
and
we
jumped
into
it
too
hastily
what
a
waste
of
time
what
a
futile
expense
of
emotion
six
months
ago
we
could
have
been
back
in
france
in
masters
little
apartment
conseil
answered
in
masters
museum
and
by
now
i
would
have
classified
masters
fossils
and
masters
babirusa
would
be
ensconced
in
its
cage
at
the
zoo
in
the
botanical
gardens
and
it
would
have
attracted
every
curiosity
seeker
in
town
quite
so
conseil
and
whats
more
i
imagine
that
people
will
soon
be
poking
fun
at
us
to
be
sure
conseil
replied
serenely
i
do
think
theyll
have
fun
at
masters
expense
and
must
it
be
said




it
must
be
said
conseil
well
then
it
will
serve
master
right
how
true
when
one
has
the
honor
of
being
an
expert
as
master
is
one
mustnt
lay
himself
open
to
conseil
didnt
have
time
to
complete
the
compliment
in
the
midst
of
the
general
silence
a
voice
became
audible
it
was
ned
lands
voice
and
it
shouted
ahoy
theres
the
thing
in
question
abreast
of
us
to
leeward
chapter
6
at
full
steam
at
this
shout
the
entire
crew
rushed
toward
the
harpoonercommander
officers
mates
sailors
cabin
boys
down
to
engineers
leaving
their
machinery
and
stokers
neglecting
their
furnaces
the
order
was
given
to
stop
and
the
frigate
merely
coasted
by
then
the
darkness
was
profound
and
as
good
as
the
canadians
eyes
were
i
still
wondered
how
he
could
seeand
what
he
had
seen
my
heart
was
pounding
fit
to
burst
but
ned
land
was
not
mistaken
and
we
all
spotted
the
object
his
hand
was
indicating
two
cable
lengths
off
the
abraham
lincolns
starboard
quarter
the
sea
seemed
to
be
lit
up
from
underneath
this
was
no
mere
phosphorescent
phenomenon
that
much
was
unmistakable
submerged
some
fathoms
below
the
surface
of
the
water
the
monster
gave
off
that
very
intense
but
inexplicable
glow
that
several
captains
had
mentioned
in
their
reports
this
magnificent
radiance
had
to
come
from
some
force
with
a
great
illuminating
capacity
the
edge
of
its
light
swept
over
the
sea
in
an
immense
highly
elongated
oval
condensing
at
the
center
into
a
blazing
core
whose
unbearable
glow
diminished
by
degrees
outward
its
only
a
cluster
of
phosphorescent
particles
exclaimed
one
of
the
officers
no
sir
i
answered
with
conviction
not
even
angelwing
clams
or
salps
have
ever
given
off
such
a
powerful
light
that
glow
is
basically
electric
in
nature
besides



look
look
its
shifting
its
moving
back
and
forth
its
darting
at
us
a
universal
shout
went
up
from
the
frigate
quiet
commander
farragut
said

hard
to

sailors
rushed
to
the

engineers
to
their

under

immediately
the

beat

in
a

commander
farragut
called
these
orders
were
executed
and
the
frigate
swiftly
retreated
from
this
core
of
light
my
mistake
it
wanted
to
retreat
but
the
unearthly
animal
came
at
us
with
a
speed
double
our
own
we
gasped
more
stunned
than
afraid
we
stood
mute
and
motionless
the
animal
caught
up
with
us
played
with
us
it
made
a
full
circle
around
the
frigatethen
doing
fourteen
knotsand
wrapped
us
in
sheets
of
electricity
that
were
like
luminous
dust
then
it
retreated
two
or
three
miles
leaving
a
phosphorescent
trail
comparable
to
those
swirls
of
steam
that
shoot
behind
the
locomotive
of
an
express
train
suddenly
all
the
way
from
the
dark
horizon
where
it
had
gone
to
gather
momentum
the
monster
abruptly
dashed
toward
the
abraham
lincoln
with
frightening
speed
stopped
sharply
twenty
feet
from
our
side
plates
and
died
outnot
by
diving
under
the
water
since
its
glow
did
not
recede
graduallybut
all
at
once
as
if
the
source
of
this
brilliant
emanation
had
suddenly
dried
up
then
it
reappeared
on
the
other
side
of
the
ship
either
by
circling
around
us
or
by
gliding
under
our
hull
at
any
instant
a
collision
could
have
occurred
that
would
have
been
fatal
to
us
meanwhile
i
was
astonished
at
the
frigates
maneuvers
it
was
fleeing
not
fighting
built
to
pursue
it
was
being
pursued
and
i
commented
on
this
to
commander
farragut
his
face
ordinarily
so
emotionless
was
stamped
with
indescribable
astonishment
professor
aronnax
he
answered
me
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
fearsome
creature
im
up
against
and
i
dont
want
my
frigate
running
foolish
risks
in
all
this
darkness
besides
how
should
we
attack
this
unknown
creature
how
should
we
defend
ourselves
against
it
lets
wait
for
daylight
and
then
well
play
a
different
role
youve
no
further
doubts
commander
as
to
the
nature
of
this
animal
no
sir
its
apparently
a
gigantic
narwhale
and
an
electric
one
to
boot
maybe
i
added
its
no
more
approachable
than
an
electric
eel
or
an
electric
ray
right
the
commander
replied
and
if
it
has
their
power
to
electrocute
its
surely
the
most
dreadful
animal
ever
conceived
by
our
creator
thats
why
ill
keep
on
my
guard
sir
the
whole
crew
stayed
on
their
feet
all
night
long
no
one
even
thought
of
sleeping
unable
to
compete
with
the
monsters
speed
the
abraham
lincoln
slowed
down
and
stayed
at
half
steam
for
its
part
the
narwhale
mimicked
the
frigate
simply
rode
with
the
waves
and
seemed
determined
not
to
forsake
the
field
of
battle
however
near
midnight
it
disappeared
or
to
use
a
more
appropriate
expression
it
went
out
like
a
huge
glowworm
had
it
fled
from
us
we
were
duty
bound
to
fear
so
rather
than
hope
so
but
at
1253
in
the
morning
a
deafening
hiss
became
audible
resembling
the
sound
made
by
a
waterspout
expelled
with
tremendous
intensity
by
then
commander
farragut
ned
land
and
i
were
on
the
afterdeck
peering
eagerly
into
the
profound
gloom
ned
land
the
commander
asked
youve
often
heard
whales
bellowing
often
sir
but
never
a
whale
like
this
whose
sighting
earned
me
200000
correct
the
prize
is
rightfully
yours
but
tell
me
isnt
that
the
noise
cetaceans
make
when
they
spurt
water
from
their
blowholes
the
very
noise
sir
but
this
ones
way
louder
so
there
can
be
no
mistake
theres
definitely
a
whale
lurking
in
our
waters
with
your
permission
sir
the
harpooner
added
tomorrow
at
daybreak
well
have
words
with
it
if
its
in
a
mood
to
listen
to
you
mr
land
i
replied
in
a
tone
far
from
convinced
let
me
get
within
four
harpoon
lengths
of
it
the
canadian
shot
back
and
it
had
better
listen
but
to
get
near
it
the
commander
went
on
id
have
to
put
a
whaleboat
at
your
disposal
certainly
sir
that
would
be
gambling
with
the
lives
of
my
men
and
with
my
own
the
harpooner
replied
simply
near
two
oclock
in
the
morning
the
core
of
light
reappeared
no
less
intense
five
miles
to
windward
of
the
abraham
lincoln
despite
the
distance
despite
the
noise
of
wind
and
sea
we
could
distinctly
hear
the
fearsome
thrashings
of
the
animals
tail
and
even
its
panting
breath
seemingly
the
moment
this
enormous
narwhale
came
up
to
breathe
at
the
surface
of
the
ocean
air
was
sucked
into
its
lungs
like
steam
into
the
huge
cylinders
of
a
2000horsepower
engine
hmm
i
said
to
myself
a
cetacean
as
powerful
as
a
whole
cavalry
regimentnow
thats
a
whale
of
a
whale
we
stayed
on
the
alert
until
daylight
getting
ready
for
action
whaling
gear
was
set
up
along
the
railings
our
chief
officer
loaded
the
blunderbusses
which
can
launch
harpoons
as
far
as
a
mile
and
long
duck
guns
with
exploding
bullets
that
can
mortally
wound
even
the
most
powerful
animals
ned
land
was
content
to
sharpen
his
harpoon
a
dreadful
weapon
in
his
hands
at
six
oclock
day
began
to
break
and
with
the
dawns
early
light
the
narwhales
electric
glow
disappeared
at
seven
oclock
the
day
was
well
along
but
a
very
dense
morning
mist
shrank
the
horizon
and
our
best
spyglasses
were
unable
to
pierce
it
the
outcome
disappointment
and
anger
i
hoisted
myself
up
to
the
crosstrees
of
the
mizzen
sail
some
officers
were
already
perched
on
the
mastheads
at
eight
oclock
the
mist
rolled
ponderously
over
the
waves
and
its
huge
curls
were
lifting
little
by
little
the
horizon
grew
wider
and
clearer
all
at
once
suddenly
just
as
on
the
previous
evening
ned
lands
voice
was
audible
theres
the
thing
in
question
astern
to
port
the
harpooner
shouted
every
eye
looked
toward
the
point
indicated
there
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
frigate
a
long
blackish
body
emerged
a
meter
above
the
waves
quivering
violently
its
tail
was
creating
a
considerable
eddy
never
had
caudal
equipment
thrashed
the
sea
with
such
power
an
immense
wake
of
glowing
whiteness
marked
the
animals
track
sweeping
in
a
long
curve
our
frigate
drew
nearer
to
the
cetacean
i
examined
it
with
a
completely
open
mind
those
reports
from
the
shannon
and
the
helvetia
had
slightly
exaggerated
its
dimensions
and
i
put
its
length
at
only
250
feet
its
girth
was
more
difficult
to
judge
but
all
in
all
the
animal
seemed
to
be
wonderfully
proportioned
in
all
three
dimensions
while
i
was
observing
this
phenomenal
creature
two
jets
of
steam
and
water
sprang
from
its
blowholes
and
rose
to
an
altitude
of
forty
meters
which
settled
for
me
its
mode
of
breathing
from
this
i
finally
concluded
that
it
belonged
to
the
branch
vertebrata
class
mammalia
subclass
monodelphia
group
pisciforma
order
cetacea
family



but
here
i
couldnt
make
up
my
mind
the
order
cetacea
consists
of
three
families
baleen
whales
sperm
whales
dolphins
and
its
in
this
last
group
that
narwhales
are
placed
each
of
these
families
is
divided
into
several
genera
each
genus
into
species
each
species
into
varieties
so
i
was
still
missing
variety
species
genus
and
family
but
no
doubt
i
would
complete
my
classifying
with
the
aid
of
heaven
and
commander
farragut
the
crew
were
waiting
impatiently
for
orders
from
their
leader
the
latter
after
carefully
observing
the
animal
called
for
his
engineer
the
engineer
raced
over
sir
the
commander
said
are
you
up
to
pressure
aye
sir
the
engineer
replied
fine
stoke
your
furnaces
and
clap
on
full
steam
three
cheers
greeted
this
order
the
hour
of
battle
had
sounded
a
few
moments
later
the
frigates
two
funnels
vomited
torrents
of
black
smoke
and
its
deck
quaked
from
the
trembling
of
its
boilers
driven
forward
by
its
powerful
propeller
the
abraham
lincoln
headed
straight
for
the
animal
unconcerned
the
latter
let
us
come
within
half
a
cable
length
then
not
bothering
to
dive
it
got
up
a
little
speed
retreated
and
was
content
to
keep
its
distance
this
chase
dragged
on
for
about
threequarters
of
an
hour
without
the
frigate
gaining
two
fathoms
on
the
cetacean
at
this
rate
it
was
obvious
that
we
would
never
catch
up
with
it
infuriated
commander
farragut
kept
twisting
the
thick
tuft
of
hair
that
flourished
below
his
chin
ned
land
he
called
the
canadian
reported
at
once
well
mr
land
the
commander
asked
do
you
still
advise
putting
my
longboats
to
sea
no
sir
ned
land
replied
because
that
beast
wont
be
caught
against
its
will
then
what
should
we
do
stoke
up
more
steam
sir
if
you
can
as
for
me
with
your
permission
ill
go
perch
on
the
bobstays
under
the
bowsprit
and
if
we
can
get
within
a
harpoon
length
ill
harpoon
the
brute
go
to
it
ned
commander
farragut
replied
engineer
he
called
keep
the
pressure
mounting
ned
land
made
his
way
to
his
post
the
furnaces
were
urged
into
greater
activity
our
propeller
did
fortythree
revolutions
per
minute
and
steam
shot
from
the
valves
heaving
the
log
we
verified
that
the
abraham
lincoln
was
going
at
the
rate
of
185
miles
per
hour
but
that
damned
animal
also
did
a
speed
of
185
for
the
next
hour
our
frigate
kept
up
this
pace
without
gaining
a
fathom
this
was
humiliating
for
one
of
the
fastest
racers
in
the
american
navy
the
crew
were
working
up
into
a
blind
rage
sailor
after
sailor
heaved
insults
at
the
monster
which
couldnt
be
bothered
with
answering
back
commander
farragut
was
no
longer
content
simply
to
twist
his
goatee
he
chewed
on
it
the
engineer
was
summoned
once
again
youre
up
to
maximum
pressure
the
commander
asked
him
aye
sir
the
engineer
replied
and
your
valves
are
charged
to




to
six
and
a
half
atmospheres
charge
them
to
ten
atmospheres
a
typical
american
order
if
i
ever
heard
one
it
would
have
sounded
just
fine
during
some
mississippi
paddlewheeler
race
to
outstrip
the
competition
conseil
i
said
to
my
gallant
servant
now
at
my
side
you
realize
that
well
probably
blow
ourselves
skyhigh
as
master
wishes
conseil
replied
all
right
i
admit
it
i
did
wish
to
run
this
risk
the
valves
were
charged
more
coal
was
swallowed
by
the
furnaces
ventilators
shot
torrents
of
air
over
the
braziers
the
abraham
lincolns
speed
increased
its
masts
trembled
down
to
their
blocks
and
swirls
of
smoke
could
barely
squeeze
through
the
narrow
funnels
we
heaved
the
log
a
second
time
well
helmsman
commander
farragut
asked
193
miles
per
hour
sir
keep
stoking
the
furnaces
the
engineer
did
so
the
pressure
gauge
marked
ten
atmospheres
but
no
doubt
the
cetacean
itself
had
warmed
up
because
without
the
least
trouble
it
also
did
193
what
a
chase
no
i
cant
describe
the
excitement
that
shook
my
very
being
ned
land
stayed
at
his
post
harpoon
in
hand
several
times
the
animal
let
us
approach
were
overhauling
it
the
canadian
would
shout
then
just
as
he
was
about
to
strike
the
cetacean
would
steal
off
with
a
swiftness
i
could
estimate
at
no
less
than
thirty
miles
per
hour
and
even
at
our
maximum
speed
it
took
the
liberty
of
thumbing
its
nose
at
the
frigate
by
running
a
full
circle
around
us
a
howl
of
fury
burst
from
every
throat
by
noon
we
were
no
farther
along
than
at
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
commander
farragut
then
decided
to
use
more
direct
methods
bah
he
said
so
that
animal
is
faster
than
the
abraham
lincoln
all
right
well
see
if
it
can
outrun
our
conical
shells
mate
man
the
gun
in
the
bow
our
forecastle
cannon
was
immediately
loaded
and
leveled
the
cannoneer
fired
a
shot
but
his
shell
passed
some
feet
above
the
cetacean
which
stayed
half
a
mile
off
over
to
somebody
with
better
aim
the
commander
shouted
and
50000
to
the
man
who
can
pierce
that
infernal
beast
calm
of
eye
cool
of
feature
an
old
graybearded
gunneri
can
see
him
to
this
dayapproached
the
cannon
put
it
in
position
and
took
aim
for
a
good
while
there
was
a
mighty
explosion
mingled
with
cheers
from
the
crew
the
shell
reached
its
target
it
hit
the
animal
but
not
in
the
usual
fashionit
bounced
off
that
rounded
surface
and
vanished
into
the
sea
two
miles
out
oh
drat
said
the
old
gunner
in
his
anger
that
rascal
must
be
covered
with
sixinch
armor
plate
curse
the
beast
commander
farragut
shouted
the
hunt
was
on
again
and
commander
farragut
leaned
over
to
me
saying
ill
chase
that
animal
till
my
frigate
explodes
yes
i
replied
and
nobody
would
blame
you
we
could
still
hope
that
the
animal
would
tire
out
and
not
be
as
insensitive
to
exhaustion
as
our
steam
engines
but
no
such
luck
hour
after
hour
went
by
without
it
showing
the
least
sign
of
weariness
however
to
the
abraham
lincolns
credit
it
must
be
said
that
we
struggled
on
with
tireless
persistence
i
estimate
that
we
covered
a
distance
of
at
least
500
kilometers
during
this
illfated
day
of
november
6
but
night
fell
and
wrapped
the
surging
ocean
in
its
shadows
by
then
i
thought
our
expedition
had
come
to
an
end
that
we
would
never
see
this
fantastic
animal
again
i
was
mistaken
at
1050
in
the
evening
that
electric
light
reappeared
three
miles
to
windward
of
the
frigate
just
as
clear
and
intense
as
the
night
before
the
narwhale
seemed
motionless
was
it
asleep
perhaps
weary
from
its
workday
just
riding
with
the
waves
this
was
our
chance
and
commander
farragut
was
determined
to
take
full
advantage
of
it
he
gave
his
orders
the
abraham
lincoln
stayed
at
half
steam
advancing
cautiously
so
as
not
to
awaken
its
adversary
in
midocean
its
not
unusual
to
encounter
whales
so
sound
asleep
they
can
successfully
be
attacked
and
ned
land
had
harpooned
more
than
one
in
its
slumber
the
canadian
went
to
resume
his
post
on
the
bobstays
under
the
bowsprit
the
frigate
approached
without
making
a
sound
stopped
two
cable
lengths
from
the
animal
and
coasted
not
a
soul
breathed
on
board
a
profound
silence
reigned
over
the
deck
we
were
not
100
feet
from
the
blazing
core
of
light
whose
glow
grew
stronger
and
dazzled
the
eyes
just
then
leaning
over
the
forecastle
railing
i
saw
ned
land
below
me
one
hand
grasping
the
martingale
the
other
brandishing
his
dreadful
harpoon
barely
twenty
feet
separated
him
from
the
motionless
animal
all
at
once
his
arm
shot
forward
and
the
harpoon
was
launched
i
heard
the
weapon
collide
resonantly
as
if
it
had
hit
some
hard
substance
the
electric
light
suddenly
went
out
and
two
enormous
waterspouts
crashed
onto
the
deck
of
the
frigate
racing
like
a
torrent
from
stem
to
stern
toppling
crewmen
breaking
spare
masts
and
yardarms
from
their
lashings
a
hideous
collision
occurred
and
thrown
over
the
rail
with
no
time
to
catch
hold
of
it
i
was
hurled
into
the
sea
chapter
7
a
whale
of
unknown
species
although
i
was
startled
by
this
unexpected
descent
i
at
least
have
a
very
clear
recollection
of
my
sensations
during
it
at
first
i
was
dragged
about
twenty
feet
under
im
a
good
swimmer
without
claiming
to
equal
such
other
authors
as
byron
and
edgar
allan
poe
who
were
master
divers
and
i
didnt
lose
my
head
on
the
way
down
with
two
vigorous
kicks
of
the
heel
i
came
back
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
my
first
concern
was
to
look
for
the
frigate
had
the
crew
seen
me
go
overboard
was
the
abraham
lincoln
tacking
about
would
commander
farragut
put
a
longboat
to
sea
could
i
hope
to
be
rescued
the
gloom
was
profound
i
glimpsed
a
black
mass
disappearing
eastward
where
its
running
lights
were
fading
out
in
the
distance
it
was
the
frigate
i
felt
i
was
done
for
help
help
i
shouted
swimming
desperately
toward
the
abraham
lincoln
my
clothes
were
weighing
me
down
the
water
glued
them
to
my
body
they
were
paralyzing
my
movements
i
was
sinking
i
was
suffocating




help
this
was
the
last
shout
i
gave
my
mouth
was
filling
with
water
i
struggled
against
being
dragged
into
the
depths



suddenly
my
clothes
were
seized
by
energetic
hands
i
felt
myself
pulled
abruptly
back
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
yes
i
heard
these
words
pronounced
in
my
ear
if
master
would
oblige
me
by
leaning
on
my
shoulder
master
will
swim
with
much
greater
ease
with
one
hand
i
seized
the
arm
of
my
loyal
conseil
you
i
said
you
myself
conseil
replied
and
at
masters
command
that
collision
threw
you
overboard
along
with
me
not
at
all
but
being
in
masters
employ
i
followed
master
the
fine
lad
thought
this
only
natural
what
about
the
frigate
i
asked
the
frigate
conseil
replied
rolling
over
on
his
back
i
think
master
had
best
not
depend
on
it
to
any
great
extent
what
are
you
saying
im
saying
that
just
as
i
jumped
overboard
i
heard
the
men
at
the
helm
shout
our
propeller
and
rudder
are
smashed

smashed
yes
smashed
by
the
monsters
tusk
i
believe
its
the
sole
injury
the
abraham
lincoln
has
sustained
but
most
inconveniently
for
us
the
ship
can
no
longer
steer
then
were
done
for
perhaps
conseil
replied
serenely
however
we
still
have
a
few
hours
before
us
and
in
a
few
hours
one
can
do
a
great
many
things
conseils
unflappable
composure
cheered
me
up
i
swam
more
vigorously
but
hampered
by
clothes
that
were
as
restricting
as
a
cloak
made
of
lead
i
was
managing
with
only
the
greatest
difficulty
conseil
noticed
as
much
master
will
allow
me
to
make
an
incision
he
said
and
he
slipped
an
open
clasp
knife
under
my
clothes
slitting
them
from
top
to
bottom
with
one
swift
stroke
then
he
briskly
undressed
me
while
i
swam
for
us
both
i
then
did
conseil
the
same
favor
and
we
continued
to
navigate
side
by
side
but
our
circumstances
were
no
less
dreadful
perhaps
they
hadnt
seen
us
go
overboard
and
even
if
they
had
the
frigatebeing
undone
by
its
ruddercouldnt
return
to
leeward
after
us
so
we
could
count
only
on
its
longboats
conseil
had
coolly
reasoned
out
this
hypothesis
and
laid
his
plans
accordingly
an
amazing
character
this
boy
in
midocean
this
stoic
lad
seemed
right
at
home
so
having
concluded
that
our
sole
chance
for
salvation
lay
in
being
picked
up
by
the
abraham
lincolns
longboats
we
had
to
take
steps
to
wait
for
them
as
long
as
possible
consequently
i
decided
to
divide
our
energies
so
we
wouldnt
both
be
worn
out
at
the
same
time
and
this
was
the
arrangement
while
one
of
us
lay
on
his
back
staying
motionless
with
arms
crossed
and
legs
outstretched
the
other
would
swim
and
propel
his
partner
forward
this
towing
role
was
to
last
no
longer
than
ten
minutes
and
by
relieving
each
other
in
this
way
we
could
stay
afloat
for
hours
perhaps
even
until
daybreak
slim
chance
but
hope
springs
eternal
in
the
human
breast
besides
there
were
two
of
us
lastly
i
can
vouchas
improbable
as
it
seemsthat
even
if
i
had
wanted
to
destroy
all
my
illusions
even
if
i
had
been
willing
to
give
in
to
despair
i
could
not
have
done
so
the
cetacean
had
rammed
our
frigate
at
about
eleven
oclock
in
the
evening
i
therefore
calculated
on
eight
hours
of
swimming
until
sunrise
a
strenuous
task
but
feasible
thanks
to
our
relieving
each
other
the
sea
was
pretty
smooth
and
barely
tired
us
sometimes
i
tried
to
peer
through
the
dense
gloom
which
was
broken
only
by
the
phosphorescent
flickers
coming
from
our
movements
i
stared
at
the
luminous
ripples
breaking
over
my
hands
shimmering
sheets
spattered
with
blotches
of
bluish
gray
it
seemed
as
if
wed
plunged
into
a
pool
of
quicksilver
near
one
oclock
in
the
morning
i
was
overcome
with
tremendous
exhaustion
my
limbs
stiffened
in
the
grip
of
intense
cramps
conseil
had
to
keep
me
going
and
attending
to
our
selfpreservation
became
his
sole
responsibility
i
soon
heard
the
poor
lad
gasping
his
breathing
became
shallow
and
quick
i
didnt
think
he
could
stand
such
exertions
for
much
longer
go
on
go
on
i
told
him
leave
master
behind
he
replied
never
ill
drown
before
he
does
just
then
past
the
fringes
of
a
large
cloud
that
the
wind
was
driving
eastward
the
moon
appeared
the
surface
of
the
sea
glistened
under
its
rays
that
kindly
light
rekindled
our
strength
i
held
up
my
head
again
my
eyes
darted
to
every
point
of
the
horizon
i
spotted
the
frigate
it
was
five
miles
from
us
and
formed
no
more
than
a
dark
barely
perceptible
mass
but
as
for
longboats
not
a
one
in
sight
i
tried
to
call
out
what
was
the
use
at
such
a
distance
my
swollen
lips
wouldnt
let
a
single
sound
through
conseil
could
still
articulate
a
few
words
and
i
heard
him
repeat
at
intervals
help
help
ceasing
all
movement
for
an
instant
we
listened
and
it
may
have
been
a
ringing
in
my
ear
from
this
organ
filling
with
impeded
blood
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
conseils
shout
had
received
an
answer
back
did
you
hear
that
i
muttered
yes
yes
and
conseil
hurled
another
desperate
plea
into
space
this
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
a
human
voice
had
answered
us
was
it
the
voice
of
some
poor
devil
left
behind
in
midocean
some
other
victim
of
that
collision
suffered
by
our
ship
or
was
it
one
of
the
frigates
longboats
hailing
us
out
of
the
gloom
conseil
made
one
final
effort
and
bracing
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
while
i
offered
resistance
with
one
supreme
exertion
he
raised
himself
half
out
of
the
water
then
fell
back
exhausted
what
did
you
see
i
saw




he
muttered
i
saw



but
we
mustnt
talk



save
our
strength




what
had
he
seen
then
lord
knows
why
the
thought
of
the
monster
came
into
my
head
for
the
first
time




but
even
so
that
voice




gone
are
the
days
when
jonahs
took
refuge
in
the
bellies
of
whales
nevertheless
conseil
kept
towing
me
sometimes
he
looked
up
stared
straight
ahead
and
shouted
a
request
for
directions
which
was
answered
by
a
voice
that
was
getting
closer
and
closer
i
could
barely
hear
it
i
was
at
the
end
of
my
strength
my
fingers
gave
out
my
hands
were
no
help
to
me
my
mouth
opened
convulsively
filling
with
brine
its
coldness
ran
through
me
i
raised
my
head
one
last
time
then
i
collapsed



just
then
something
hard
banged
against
me
i
clung
to
it
then
i
felt
myself
being
pulled
upward
back
to
the
surface
of
the
water
my
chest
caved
in
and
i
fainted



for
certain
i
came
to
quickly
because
someone
was
massaging
me
so
vigorously
it
left
furrows
in
my
flesh
i
half
opened
my
eyes



conseil
i
muttered
did
master
ring
for
me
conseil
replied
just
then
in
the
last
light
of
a
moon
settling
on
the
horizon
i
spotted
a
face
that
wasnt
conseils
but
which
i
recognized
at
once
ned
i
exclaimed
in
person
sir
and
still
after
his
prize
the
canadian
replied
you
were
thrown
overboard
after
the
frigates
collision
yes
professor
but
i
was
luckier
than
you
and
right
away
i
was
able
to
set
foot
on
this
floating
islet
islet
or
in
other
words
on
our
gigantic
narwhale
explain
yourself
ned
its
just
that
i
soon
realized
why
my
harpoon
got
blunted
and
couldnt
puncture
its
hide
why
ned
why
because
professor
this
beast
is
made
of
boilerplate
steel
at
this
point
in
my
story
i
need
to
get
a
grip
on
myself
reconstruct
exactly
what
i
experienced
and
make
doubly
sure
of
everything
i
write
the
canadians
last
words
caused
a
sudden
upheaval
in
my
brain
i
swiftly
hoisted
myself
to
the
summit
of
this
halfsubmerged
creature
or
object
that
was
serving
as
our
refuge
i
tested
it
with
my
foot
obviously
it
was
some
hard
impenetrable
substance
not
the
soft
matter
that
makes
up
the
bodies
of
our
big
marine
mammals
but
this
hard
substance
could
have
been
a
bony
carapace
like
those
that
covered
some
prehistoric
animals
and
i
might
have
left
it
at
that
and
classified
this
monster
among
such
amphibious
reptiles
as
turtles
or
alligators
well
no
the
blackish
back
supporting
me
was
smooth
and
polished
with
no
overlapping
scales
on
impact
it
gave
off
a
metallic
sonority
and
as
incredible
as
this
sounds
it
seemed
i
swear
to
be
made
of
riveted
plates
no
doubts
were
possible
this
animal
this
monster
this
natural
phenomenon
that
had
puzzled
the
whole
scientific
world
that
had
muddled
and
misled
the
minds
of
seamen
in
both
hemispheres
was
there
could
be
no
escaping
it
an
even
more
astonishing
phenomenona
phenomenon
made
by
the
hand
of
man
even
if
i
had
discovered
that
some
fabulous
mythological
creature
really
existed
it
wouldnt
have
given
me
such
a
terrific
mental
jolt
its
easy
enough
to
accept
that
prodigious
things
can
come
from
our
creator
but
to
find
all
at
once
right
before
your
eyes
that
the
impossible
had
been
mysteriously
achieved
by
man
himself
this
staggers
the
mind
but
there
was
no
question
now
we
were
stretched
out
on
the
back
of
some
kind
of
underwater
boat
that
as
far
as
i
could
judge
boasted
the
shape
of
an
immense
steel
fish
ned
land
had
clear
views
on
the
issue
conseil
and
i
could
only
line
up
behind
him
but
then
i
said
does
this
contraption
contain
some
sort
of
locomotive
mechanism
and
a
crew
to
run
it
apparently
the
harpooner
replied
and
yet
for
the
three
hours
ive
lived
on
this
floating
island
it
hasnt
shown
a
sign
of
life
this
boat
hasnt
moved
at
all
no
professor
aronnax
it
just
rides
with
the
waves
but
otherwise
it
hasnt
stirred
but
we
know
that
its
certainly
gifted
with
great
speed
now
then
since
an
engine
is
needed
to
generate
that
speed
and
a
mechanic
to
run
that
engine
i
conclude
were
saved
humph
ned
land
put
in
his
tone
denoting
reservations
just
then
as
if
to
take
my
side
in
the
argument
a
bubbling
began
astern
of
this
strange
submersiblewhose
drive
mechanism
was
obviously
a
propellerand
the
boat
started
to
move
we
barely
had
time
to
hang
on
to
its
topside
which
emerged
about
eighty
centimeters
above
water
fortunately
its
speed
was
not
excessive
so
long
as
it
navigates
horizontally
ned
land
muttered
ive
no
complaints
but
if
it
gets
the
urge
to
dive
i
wouldnt
give
200
for
my
hide
the
canadian
might
have
quoted
a
much
lower
price
so
it
was
imperative
to
make
contact
with
whatever
beings
were
confined
inside
the
plating
of
this
machine
i
searched
its
surface
for
an
opening
or
a
hatch
a
manhole
to
use
the
official
term
but
the
lines
of
rivets
had
been
firmly
driven
into
the
sheetiron
joins
and
were
straight
and
uniform
moreover
the
moon
then
disappeared
and
left
us
in
profound
darkness
we
had
to
wait
for
daylight
to
find
some
way
of
getting
inside
this
underwater
boat
so
our
salvation
lay
totally
in
the
hands
of
the
mysterious
helmsmen
steering
this
submersible
and
if
it
made
a
dive
we
were
done
for
but
aside
from
this
occurring
i
didnt
doubt
the
possibility
of
our
making
contact
with
them
in
fact
if
they
didnt
produce
their
own
air
they
inevitably
had
to
make
periodic
visits
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
to
replenish
their
oxygen
supply
hence
the
need
for
some
opening
that
put
the
boats
interior
in
contact
with
the
atmosphere
as
for
any
hope
of
being
rescued
by
commander
farragut
that
had
to
be
renounced
completely
we
were
being
swept
westward
and
i
estimate
that
our
comparatively
moderate
speed
reached
twelve
miles
per
hour
the
propeller
churned
the
waves
with
mathematical
regularity
sometimes
emerging
above
the
surface
and
throwing
phosphorescent
spray
to
great
heights
near
four
oclock
in
the
morning
the
submersible
picked
up
speed
we
could
barely
cope
with
this
dizzying
rush
and
the
waves
battered
us
at
close
range
fortunately
neds
hands
came
across
a
big
mooring
ring
fastened
to
the
topside
of
this
sheetiron
back
and
we
all
held
on
for
dear
life
finally
this
long
night
was
over
my
imperfect
memories
wont
let
me
recall
my
every
impression
of
it
a
single
detail
comes
back
to
me
several
times
during
various
lulls
of
wind
and
sea
i
thought
i
heard
indistinct
sounds
a
sort
of
elusive
harmony
produced
by
distant
musical
chords
what
was
the
secret
behind
this
underwater
navigating
whose
explanation
the
whole
world
had
sought
in
vain
what
beings
lived
inside
this
strange
boat
what
mechanical
force
allowed
it
to
move
about
with
such
prodigious
speed
daylight
appeared
the
morning
mists
surrounded
us
but
they
soon
broke
up
i
was
about
to
proceed
with
a
careful
examination
of
the
hull
whose
topside
formed
a
sort
of
horizontal
platform
when
i
felt
it
sinking

stamping
his
foot
on
the
resonant

open
up
there
you
antisocial
navigators
but
it
was
difficult
to
make
yourself
heard
above
the
deafening
beats
of
the
propeller
fortunately
this
submerging
movement
stopped
from
inside
the
boat
there
suddenly
came
noises
of
iron
fastenings
pushed
roughly
aside
one
of
the
steel
plates
flew
up
a
man
appeared
gave
a
bizarre
yell
and
instantly
disappeared
a
few
moments
later
eight
strapping
fellows
appeared
silently
their
faces
like
masks
and
dragged
us
down
into
their
fearsome
machine

this
brutally
executed
capture
was
carried
out
with
lightning
speed
my
companions
and
i
had
no
time
to
collect
ourselves
i
dont
know
how
they
felt
about
being
shoved
inside
this
aquatic
prison
but
as
for
me
i
was
shivering
all
over
with
whom
were
we
dealing
surely
with
some
new
breed
of
pirates
exploiting
the
sea
after
their
own
fashion
the
narrow
hatch
had
barely
closed
over
me
when
i
was
surrounded
by
profound
darkness
saturated
with
the
outside
light
my
eyes
couldnt
make
out
a
thing
i
felt
my
naked
feet
clinging
to
the
steps
of
an
iron
ladder
forcibly
seized
ned

and

were
behind
me
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
a
door
opened
and
instantly
closed
behind
us
with
a
loud
clang
we
were
alone
where
i
couldnt
say
could
barely
even
imagine
all
was
darkness
but
such
utter
darkness
that
after
several
minutes
my
eyes
were
still
unable
to
catch
a
single
one
of
those
hazy
gleams
that
drift
through
even
the
blackest
nights
meanwhile
furious
at
these
goings
on

gave
free

my
way
after
five
steps
i
encountered
an
iron
wall
made
of
riveted
boilerplate
then
turning
around
i
bumped
into
a
wooden
table
next
to
which
several
stools
had
been
set
the
floor
of
this
prison
lay
hidden
beneath
thick
hempen
matting
that
deadened
the
sound
of
footsteps
its
naked
walls
didnt
reveal
any
trace
of
a
door
or
window
going
around
the
opposite
way
conseil
met
up
with
me
and
we
returned
to
the
middle
of
this
cabin
which
had
to
be
twenty
feet
long
by
ten
wide
as
for
its
height
not
even
ned
land
with
his
great
stature
was
able
to
determine
it
half
an
hour
had
already
gone
by
without
our
situation
changing
when
our
eyes
were
suddenly
spirited
from
utter
darkness
into
blinding
light
our
prison
lit
up
all
at
once
in
other
words
it
filled
with
luminescent
matter
so
intense
that
at
first
i
couldnt
stand
the
brightness
of
it
from
its
glare
and
whiteness
i
recognized
the
electric
glow
that
had
played
around
this
underwater
boat
like
some
magnificent
phosphorescent
phenomenon
after
involuntarily
closing
my
eyes
i
reopened
them
and
saw
that
this
luminous
force
came
from
a
frosted
half
globe
curving
out
of
the
cabins
ceiling
finally
its
light
enough
to
see
ned
land
exclaimed
knife
in
hand
staying
on
the
defensive
yes
i
replied
then
ventured
the
opposite
view
but
as
for
our
situation
were
still
in
the
dark
master
must
learn
patience
said
the
emotionless
conseil
this
sudden
illumination
of
our
cabin
enabled
me
to
examine
its
tiniest
details
it
contained
only
a
table
and
five
stools
its
invisible
door
must
have
been
hermetically
sealed
not
a
sound
reached
our
ears
everything
seemed
dead
inside
this
boat
was
it
in
motion
or
stationary
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
or
sinking
into
the
depths
i
couldnt
tell
but
this
luminous
globe
hadnt
been
turned
on
without
good
reason
consequently
i
hoped
that
some
crewmen
would
soon
make
an
appearance
if
you
want
to
consign
people
to
oblivion
you
dont
light
up
their
dungeons
i
was
not
mistaken
unlocking
noises
became
audible
a
door
opened
and
two
men
appeared
one
was
short
and
stocky
powerfully
muscled
broad
shouldered
robust
of
limbs
the
head
squat
the
hair
black
and
luxuriant
the
mustache
heavy
the
eyes
bright
and
penetrating
and
his
whole
personality
stamped
with
that
southernblooded
zest
that
in
france
typifies
the
people
of
provence
the
philosopher
diderot
has
very
aptly
claimed
that
a
mans
bearing
is
the
clue
to
his
character
and
this
stocky
little
man
was
certainly
a
living
proof
of
this
claim
you
could
sense
that
his
everyday
conversation
must
have
been
packed
with
such
vivid
figures
of
speech
as
personification
symbolism
and
misplaced
modifiers
but
i
was
never
in
a
position
to
verify
this
because
around
me
he
used
only
an
odd
and
utterly
incomprehensible
dialect
the
second
stranger
deserves
a
more
detailed
description
a
disciple
of
such
characterjudging
anatomists
as
gratiolet
or
engel
could
have
read
this
mans
features
like
an
open
book
without
hesitation
i
identified
his
dominant
qualitiesselfconfidence
since
his
head
reared
like
a
noblemans
above
the
arc
formed
by
the
lines
of
his
shoulders
and
his
black
eyes
gazed
with
icy
assurance
calmness
since
his
skin
pale
rather
than
ruddy
indicated
tranquility
of
blood
energy
shown
by
the
swiftly
knitting
muscles
of
his
brow
and
finally
courage
since
his
deep
breathing
denoted
tremendous
reserves
of
vitality
i
might
add
that
this
was
a
man
of
great
pride
that
his
calm
firm
gaze
seemed
to
reflect
thinking
on
an
elevated
plane
and
that
the
harmony
of
his
facial
expressions
and
bodily
movements
resulted
in
an
overall
effect
of
unquestionable
candoraccording
to
the
findings
of
physiognomists
those
analysts
of
facial
character
i
felt
involuntarily
reassured
in
his
presence
and
this
boded
well
for
our
interview
whether
this
individual
was
thirtyfive
or
fifty
years
of
age
i
could
not
precisely
state
he
was
tall
his
forehead
broad
his
nose
straight
his
mouth
clearly
etched
his
teeth
magnificent
his
hands
refined
tapered
and
to
use
a
word
from
palmistry
highly
psychic
in
other
words
worthy
of
serving
a
lofty
and
passionate
spirit
this
man
was
certainly
the
most
wonderful
physical
specimen
i
had
ever
encountered
one
unusual
detail
his
eyes
were
spaced
a
little
far
from
each
other
and
could
instantly
take
in
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
horizon
this
abilityas
i
later
verifiedwas
strengthened
by
a
range
of
vision
even
greater
than
ned
lands
when
this
stranger
focused
his
gaze
on
an
object
his
eyebrow
lines
gathered
into
a
frown
his
heavy
eyelids
closed
around
his
pupils
to
contract
his
huge
field
of
vision
and
he
looked
what
a
lookas
if
he
could
magnify
objects
shrinking
into
the
distance
as
if
he
could
probe
your
very
soul
as
if
he
could
pierce
those
sheets
of
water
so
opaque
to
our
eyes
and
scan
the
deepest
seas




wearing
caps
made
of
seaotter
fur
and
shod
in
sealskin
fishing
boots
these
two
strangers
were
dressed
in
clothing
made
from
some
unique
fabric
that
flattered
the
figure
and
allowed
great
freedom
of
movement
the
taller
of
the
twoapparently
the
leader
on
boardexamined
us
with
the
greatest
care
but
without
pronouncing
a
word
then
turning
to
his
companion
he
conversed
with
him
in
a
language
i
didnt
recognize
it
was
a
sonorous
harmonious
flexible
dialect
whose
vowels
seemed
to
undergo
a
highly
varied
accentuation
the
other
replied
with
a
shake
of
the
head
and
added
two
or
three
utterly
incomprehensible
words
then
he
seemed
to
question
me
directly
with
a
long
stare
i
replied
in
clear
french
that
i
wasnt
familiar
with
his
language
but
he
didnt
seem
to
understand
me
and
the
situation
grew
rather
baffling
still
master
should
tell
our
story
conseil
said
to
me
perhaps
these
gentlemen
will
grasp
a
few
words
of
it
i
tried
again
telling
the
tale
of
our
adventures
clearly
articulating
my
every
syllable
and
not
leaving
out
a
single
detail
i
stated
our
names
and
titles
then
in
order
i
introduced
professor
aronnax
his
manservant
conseil
and
mr
ned
land
harpooner
the
man
with
calm
gentle
eyes
listened
to
me
serenely
even
courteously
and
paid
remarkable
attention
but
nothing
in
his
facial
expression
indicated
that
he
understood
my
story
when
i
finished
he
didnt
pronounce
a
single
word
one
resource
still
left
was
to
speak
english
perhaps
they
would
be
familiar
with
this
nearly
universal
language
but
i
only
knew
it
as
i
did
the
german
language
well
enough
to
read
it
fluently
not
well
enough
to
speak
it
correctly
here
however
our
overriding
need
was
to
make
ourselves
understood
come
on
its
your
turn
i
told
the
harpooner
over
to
you
mr
land
pull
out
of
your
bag
of
tricks
the
best
english
ever
spoken
by
an
anglosaxon
and
try
for
a
more
favorable
result
than
mine
ned
needed
no
persuading
and
started
our
story
all
over
again
most
of
which
i
could
follow
its
content
was
the
same
but
the
form
differed
carried
away
by
his
volatile
temperament
the
canadian
put
great
animation
into
it
he
complained
vehemently
about
being
imprisoned
in
defiance
of
his
civil
rights
asked
by
virtue
of
which
law
he
was
hereby
detained
invoked
writs
of
habeas
corpus
threatened
to
press
charges
against
anyone
holding
him
in
illegal
custody
ranted
gesticulated
shouted
and
finally
conveyed
by
an
expressive
gesture
that
we
were
dying
of
hunger
this
was
perfectly
true
but
we
had
nearly
forgotten
the
fact
much
to
his
amazement
the
harpooner
seemed
no
more
intelligible
than
i
had
been
our
visitors
didnt
bat
an
eye
apparently
they
were
engineers
who
understood
the
languages
of
neither
the
french
physicist
arago
nor
the
english
physicist
faraday
thoroughly
baffled
after
vainly
exhausting
our
philological
resources
i
no
longer
knew
what
tactic
to
pursue
when
conseil
told
me
if
master
will
authorize
me
ill
tell
the
whole
business
in
german
what
you
know
german
i
exclaimed
like
most
flemish
people
with
all
due
respect
to
master
on
the
contrary
my
respect
is
due
you
go
to
it
my
boy
and
conseil
in
his
serene
voice
described
for
the
third
time
the
various
vicissitudes
of
our
story
but
despite
our
narrators
fine
accent
and
stylish
turns
of
phrase
the
german
language
met
with
no
success
finally
as
a
last
resort
i
hauled
out
everything
i
could
remember
from
my
early
schooldays
and
i
tried
to
narrate
our
adventures
in
latin
cicero
would
have
plugged
his
ears
and
sent
me
to
the
scullery
but
somehow
i
managed
to
pull
through
with
the
same
negative
result
this
last
attempt
ultimately
misfiring
the
two
strangers
exchanged
a
few
words
in
their
incomprehensible
language
and
withdrew
not
even
favoring
us
with
one
of
those
encouraging
gestures
that
are
used
in
every
country
in
the
world
the
door
closed
again
this
is
outrageous
ned
land
shouted
exploding
for
the
twentieth
time
i
ask
you
we
speak
french
english
german
and
latin
to
these
rogues
and
neither
of
them
has
the
decency
to
even
answer
back
calm
down
ned
i
told
the
seething
harpooner
anger
wont
get
us
anywhere
but
professor
our
irascible
companion
went
on
cant
you
see
that
we
could
die
of
hunger
in
this
iron
cage
bah
conseil
put
in
philosophically
we
can
hold
out
a
good
while
yet
my
friends
i
said
we
mustnt
despair
weve
gotten
out
of
tighter
spots
so
please
do
me
the
favor
of
waiting
a
bit
before
you
form
your
views
on
the
commander
and
crew
of
this
boat
my
views
are
fully
formed
ned
land
shot
back
theyre
rogues
oh
good
and
from
what
country
roguedom
my
gallant
ned
as
yet
that
country
isnt
clearly
marked
on
maps
of
the
world
but
i
admit
that
the
nationality
of
these
two
strangers
is
hard
to
make
out
neither
english
french
nor
german
thats
all
we
can
say
but
im
tempted
to
think
that
the
commander
and
his
chief
officer
were
born
in
the
low
latitudes
there
must
be
southern
blood
in
them
but
as
to
whether
theyre
spaniards
turks
arabs
or
east
indians
their
physical
characteristics
dont
give
me
enough
to
go
on
and
as
for
their
speech
its
utterly
incomprehensible
thats
the
nuisance
in
not
knowing
every
language
conseil
replied
or
the
drawback
in
not
having
one
universal
language
which
would
all
go
out
the
window
ned
land
replied
dont
you
see
these
people
have
a
language
all
to
themselves
a
language
theyve
invented
just
to
cause
despair
in
decent
people
who
ask
for
a
little
dinner
why
in
every
country
on
earth
when
you
open
your
mouth
snap
your
jaws
smack
your
lips
and
teeth
isnt
that
the
worlds
most
understandable
message

quebec
to
the
tuamotu
islands
from
paris
to
the

doesnt
it

im
hungry
give
me
a
bite
to
eat
oh
conseil
put
in
there
are
some
people
so
unintelligent
by
nature



as
he
was
saying

words
the
door
opened
a
steward
entered
he
brought
us
some
clothes
jackets
and
sailors
pants
made
out
of
a
fabric
whose
nature
i
didnt
recognize
i
hurried
to
change
into
them

my
companions
followed

meanwhile
our
silent

perhaps
a

set
the

laid
three

theres
something
serious
afoot
conseil

and
it
bodes
well
bah
replied
the
rancorous
harpooner
what
the

do
you
suppose
they
eat
around
here

with

been
neatly

we
sat
down
to

we
were
dealing
with
civilized
people
and
if
it
hadnt
been
for
this
electric
light

over
us
i
would
have
thought
we
were
in
the
dining
room
of
the
hotel
adelphi
in
liverpool
or
the
grand
hotel
in

however
i
feel
compelled
to
mention
that
bread
and
wine
were
totally
absent
the
water
was
fresh

clear

it

waterwhich
wasnt
what
ned
land
had
in
mind
among
the
foods
we
were
served
i
was
able
to
identify
various
daintily
dressed
fish
but
i
couldnt
make
up
my
mind
about
certain
otherwise
excellent
dishes
and
i
couldnt
even
tell
whether
their
contents
belonged
to
the
vegetable
or
the
animal
kingdom
as
for
the
tableware
it
was
elegant
and
in
perfect
taste
each
utensil
spoon
fork
knife
and
plate
bore
on
its
reverse
a
letter
encircled
by
a
latin
motto
and
here
is
its
exact
duplicate
mobilis
in
mobili
n
moving
within
the
moving
element
it
was
a
highly
appropriate
motto
for
this
underwater
machine
so
long
as
the
preposition
in
is
translated
as
within
and
not
upon
the
letter
n
was
no
doubt
the
initial
of
the
name
of
that
mystifying
individual
in
command
beneath
the
seas
ned
and
conseil
had
no
time
for
such
musings
they
were
wolfing
down
their
food
and
without
further
ado
i
did
the
same
by
now
i
felt
reassured
about
our
fate
and
it
seemed
obvious
that
our
hosts
didnt
intend
to
let
us
die
of
starvation
but
all
earthly
things
come
to
an
end
all
things
must
pass
even
the
hunger
of
people
who
havent
eaten
for
fifteen
hours
our
appetites
appeased
we
felt
an
urgent
need
for
sleep
a
natural
reaction
after
that
interminable
night
of
fighting
for
our
lives
ye
gods
ill
sleep
soundly
conseil
said
me
im
out
like
a
light
ned
land
replied
my
two
companions
lay
down
on
the
cabins
carpeting
and
were
soon
deep
in
slumber
as
for
me
i
gave
in
less
readily
to
this
intense
need
for
sleep
too
many
thoughts
had
piled
up
in
my
mind
too
many
insoluble
questions
had
arisen
too
many
images
were
keeping
my
eyelids
open
where
were
we
what
strange
power
was
carrying
us
along
i
feltor
at
least
i
thought
i
didthe
submersible
sinking
toward
the
seas
lower
strata
intense
nightmares
besieged
me
in
these
mysterious
marine
sanctuaries
i
envisioned
hosts
of
unknown
animals
and
this
underwater
boat
seemed
to
be
a
blood
relation
of
theirs
living
breathing
just
as
fearsome




then
my
mind
grew
calmer
my
imagination
melted
into
hazy
drowsiness
and
i
soon
fell
into
an
uneasy
slumber
chapter
9
the
tantrums
of
ned
land
i
have
no
idea
how
long
this
slumber
lasted
but
it
must
have
been
a
good
while
since
we
were
completely
over
our
exhaustion
i
was
the
first
one
to
wake
up
my
companions
werent
yet
stirring
and
still
lay
in
their
corners
like
inanimate
objects
i
had
barely
gotten
up
from
my
passably
hard
mattress
when
i
felt
my
mind
clear
my
brain
go
on
the
alert
so
i
began
a
careful
reexamination
of
our
cell
nothing
had
changed
in
its
interior
arrangements
the
prison
was
still
a
prison
and
its
prisoners
still
prisoners
but
taking
advantage
of
our
slumber
the
steward
had
cleared
the
table
consequently
nothing
indicated
any
forthcoming
improvement
in
our
situation
and
i
seriously
wondered
if
we
were
doomed
to
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
in
this
cage
this
prospect
seemed
increasingly
painful
to
me
because
even
though
my
brain
was
clear
of
its
obsessions
from
the
night
before
i
was
feeling
an
odd
shortwindedness
in
my
chest
it
was
becoming
hard
for
me
to
breathe
the
heavy
air
was
no
longer
sufficient
for
the
full
play
of
my
lungs
although
our
cell
was
large
we
obviously
had
used
up
most
of
the
oxygen
it
contained
in
essence
over
an
hours
time
a
single
human
being
consumes
all
the
oxygen
found
in
100
liters
of
air
at
which
point
that
air
has
become
charged
with
a
nearly
equal
amount
of
carbon
dioxide
and
is
no
longer
fit
for
breathing
so
it
was
now
urgent
to
renew
the
air
in
our
prison
and
no
doubt
the
air
in
this
whole
underwater
boat
as
well
here
a
question
popped
into
my
head
how
did
the
commander
of
this
aquatic
residence
go
about
it
did
he
obtain
air
using
chemical
methods
releasing
the
oxygen
contained
in
potassium
chlorate
by
heating
it
meanwhile
absorbing
the
carbon
dioxide
with
potassium
hydroxide
if
so
he
would
have
to
keep
up
some
kind
of
relationship
with
the
shore
to
come
by
the
materials
needed
for
such
an
operation
did
he
simply
limit
himself
to
storing
the
air
in
highpressure
tanks
and
then
dispense
it
according
to
his
crews
needs
perhaps
or
proceeding
in
a
more
convenient
more
economical
and
consequently
more
probable
fashion
was
he
satisfied
with
merely
returning
to
breathe
at
the
surface
of
the
water
like
a
cetacean
renewing
his
oxygen
supply
every
twentyfour
hours
in
any
event
whatever
his
method
was
it
seemed
prudent
to
me
that
he
use
this
method
without
delay
in
fact
i
had
already
resorted
to
speeding
up
my
inhalations
in
order
to
extract
from
the
cell
what
little
oxygen
it
contained
when
suddenly
i
was
refreshed
by
a
current
of
clean
air
scented
with
a
salty
aroma
it
had
to
be
a
sea
breeze
lifegiving
and
charged
with
iodine
i
opened
my
mouth
wide
and
my
lungs
glutted
themselves
on
the
fresh
particles
at
the
same
time
i
felt
a
swaying
a
rolling
of
moderate
magnitude
but
definitely
noticeable
this
boat
this
sheetiron
monster
had
obviously
just
risen
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
there
to
breathe
in
good
whale
fashion
so
the
ships
mode
of
ventilation
was
finally
established
when
i
had
absorbed
a
chestful
of
this
clean
air
i
looked
for
the
conduitthe
air
carrier
if
you
preferthat
allowed
this
beneficial
influx
to
reach
us
and
i
soon
found
it
above
the
door
opened
an
air
vent
that
let
in
a
fresh
current
of
oxygen
renewing
the
thin
air
in
our
cell
i
had
gotten
to
this
point
in
my
observations
when
ned
and
conseil
woke
up
almost
simultaneously
under
the
influence
of
this
reviving
air
purification
they
rubbed
their
eyes
stretched
their
arms
and
sprang
to
their
feet
did
master
sleep
well
conseil
asked
me
with
his
perennial
good
manners
extremely
well
my
gallant
lad
i
replied
and
how
about
you
mr
ned
land
like
a
log
professor
but
i
must
be
imagining
things
because
it
seems
like
im
breathing
a
sea
breeze
a
seaman
couldnt
be
wrong
on
this
topic
and
i
told
the
canadian
what
had
gone
on
while
he
slept
good
he
said
that
explains
perfectly
all
that
bellowing
we
heard
when
our
socalled
narwhale
lay
in
sight
of
the
abraham
lincoln
perfectly
mr
land
it
was
catching
its
breath
only
ive
no
idea
what
time
it
is
professor
aronnax
unless
maybe
its
dinnertime
dinnertime
my
fine
harpooner
id
say
at
least
breakfast
time
because
weve
certainly
woken
up
to
a
new
day
which
indicates
conseil
replied
that
weve
spent
twentyfour
hours
in
slumber
thats
my
assessment
i
replied
i
wont
argue
with
you
ned
land
answered
but
dinner
or
breakfast
that
steward
will
be
plenty
welcome
whether
he
brings
the
one
or
the
other
the
one
and
the
other
conseil
said
well
put
the
canadian
replied
we
deserve
two
meals
and
speaking
for
myself
ill
do
justice
to
them
both
all
right
ned
lets
wait
and
see
i
replied
its
clear
that
these
strangers
dont
intend
to
let
us
die
of
hunger
otherwise
last
evenings
dinner
wouldnt
make
any
sense
unless
theyre
fattening
us
up
ned
shot
back
i
object
i
replied
we
have
not
fallen
into
the
hands
of
cannibals
just
because
they
dont
make
a
habit
of
it
the
canadian
replied
in
all
seriousness
doesnt
mean
they
dont
indulge
from
time
to
time
who
knows
maybe
these
people
have
gone
without
fresh
meat
for
a
long
while
and
in
that
case
three
healthy
wellbuilt
specimens
like
the
professor
his
manservant
and
me
get
rid
of
those
ideas
mr
land
i
answered
the
harpooner
and
above
all
dont
let
them
lead
you
to
flare
up
against
our
hosts
which
would
only
make
our
situation
worse
anyhow
the
harpooner
said
im
as
hungry
as
all
hades
and
dinner
or
breakfast
not
one
puny
meal
has
arrived
mr
land
i
answered
we
have
to
adapt
to
the
schedule
on
board
and
i
imagine
our
stomachs
are
running
ahead
of
the
chief
cooks
dinner
bell
well
then
well
adjust
our
stomachs
to
the
chefs
timetable
conseil
replied
serenely
there
you
go
again
conseil
my
friend
the
impatient
canadian
shot
back
you
never
allow
yourself
any
displays
of
bile
or
attacks
of
nerves
youre
everlastingly
calm
youd
say
your
aftermeal
grace
even
if
you
didnt
get
any
food
for
your
beforemeal
blessingand
youd
starve
to
death
rather
than
complain
what
good
would
it
do
conseil
asked
complaining
doesnt
have
to
do
good
it
just
feels
good
and
if
these
piratesi
say
pirates
out
of
consideration
for
the
professors
feelings
since
he
doesnt
want
us
to
call
them
cannibalsif
these
pirates
think
theyre
going
to
smother
me
in
this
cage
without
hearing
what
cusswords
spice
up
my
outbursts
theyve
got
another
think
coming
look
here
professor
aronnax
speak
frankly
how
long
do
you
figure
theyll
keep
us
in
this
iron
box
to
tell
the
truth
friend
land
i
know
little
more
about
it
than
you
do
but
in
a
nutshell
what
do
you
suppose
is
going
on
my
supposition
is
that
sheer
chance
has
made
us
privy
to
an
important
secret
now
then
if
the
crew
of
this
underwater
boat
have
a
personal
interest
in
keeping
that
secret
and
if
their
personal
interest
is
more
important
than
the
lives
of
three
men
i
believe
that
our
very
existence
is
in
jeopardy
if
such
is
not
the
case
then
at
the
first
available
opportunity
this
monster
that
has
swallowed
us
will
return
us
to
the
world
inhabited
by
our
own
kind
unless
they
recruit
us
to
serve
on
the
crew
conseil
said
and
keep
us
here
till
the
moment
ned
land
answered
when
some
frigate
thats
faster
or
smarter
than
the
abraham
lincoln
captures
this
den
of
buccaneers
then
hangs
all
of
us
by
the
neck
from
the
tip
of
a
mainmast
yardarm
well
thought
out
mr
land
i
replied
but
as
yet
i
dont
believe
weve
been
tendered
any
enlistment
offers
consequently
its
pointless
to
argue
about
what
tactics
we
should
pursue
in
such
a
case
i
repeat
lets
wait
lets
be
guided
by
events
and
lets
do
nothing
since
right
now
theres
nothing
we
can
do
on
the
contrary
professor
the
harpooner
replied
not
wanting
to
give
in
there
is
something
we
can
do
oh
and
what
mr
land
break
out
of
here
breaking
out
of
a
prison
on
shore
is
difficult
enough
but
with
an
underwater
prison
it
strikes
me
as
completely
unworkable
come
now
ned
my
friend
conseil
asked
how
would
you
answer
masters
objection
i
refuse
to
believe
that
an
american
is
at
the
end
of
his
tether
visibly
baffled
the
harpooner
said
nothing
under
the
conditions
in
which
fate
had
left
us
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
escape
but
a
canadians
wit
is
half
french
and
mr
ned
land
made
this
clear
in
his
reply
so
professor
aronnax
he
went
on
after
thinking
for
a
few
moments
you
havent
figured
out
what
people
do
when
they
cant
escape
from
their
prison
no
my
friend
easy
they
fix
things
so
they
stay
there
of
course
conseil
put
in
since
were
deep
in
the
ocean
being
inside
this
boat
is
vastly
preferable
to
being
above
it
or
below
it
but
we
fix
things
by
kicking
out
all
the
jailers
guards
and
wardens
ned
land
added
whats
this
ned
i
asked
youd
seriously
consider
taking
over
this
craft
very
seriously
the
canadian
replied
its
impossible
and
why
is
that
sir
some
promising
opportunity
might
come
up
and
i
dont
see
what
could
stop
us
from
taking
advantage
of
it
if
there
are
only
about
twenty
men
on
board
this
machine
i
dont
think
they
can
stave
off
two
frenchmen
and
a
canadian
it
seemed
wiser
to
accept
the
harpooners
proposition
than
to
debate
it
accordingly
i
was
content
to
reply
let
such
circumstances
come
mr
land
and
well
see
but
until
then
i
beg
you
to
control
your
impatience
we
need
to
act
shrewdly
and
your
flareups
wont
give
rise
to
any
promising
opportunities
so
swear
to
me
that
youll
accept
our
situation
without
throwing
a
tantrum
over
it
i
give
you
my
word
professor
ned
land
replied
in
an
unenthusiastic
tone
no
vehement
phrases
will
leave
my
mouth
no
vicious
gestures
will
give
my
feelings
away
not
even
when
they
dont
feed
us
on
time
i
have
your
word
ned
i
answered
the
canadian
then
our
conversation
petered
out
and
each
of
us
withdrew
into
his
own
thoughts
for
my
part
despite
the
harpooners
confident
talk
i
admit
that
i
entertained
no
illusions
i
had
no
faith
in
those
promising
opportunities
that
ned
land
mentioned
to
operate
with
such
efficiency
this
underwater
boat
had
to
have
a
sizeable
crew
so
if
it
came
to
a
physical
contest
we
would
be
facing
an
overwhelming
opponent
besides
before
we
could
do
anything
we
had
to
be
free
and
that
we
definitely
were
not
i
didnt
see
any
way
out
of
this
sheetiron
hermetically
sealed
cell
and
if
the
strange
commander
of
this
boat
did
have
a
secret
to
keepwhich
seemed
rather
likelyhe
would
never
give
us
freedom
of
movement
aboard
his
vessel
now
then
would
he
resort
to
violence
in
order
to
be
rid
of
us
or
would
he
drop
us
off
one
day
on
some
remote
coast
there
lay
the
unknown
all
these
hypotheses
seemed
extremely
plausible
to
me
and
to
hope
for
freedom
through
use
of
force
you
had
to
be
a
harpooner
i
realized
moreover
that
ned
lands
brooding
was
getting
him
madder
by
the
minute
little
by
little
i
heard
those
aforesaid
cusswords
welling
up
in
the
depths
of
his
gullet
and
i
saw
his
movements
turn
threatening
again
he
stood
up
pacing
in
circles
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
cage
striking
the
walls
with
his
foot
and
fist
meanwhile
the
hours
passed
our
hunger
nagged
unmercifully
and
this
time
the
steward
did
not
appear
which
amounted
to
forgetting
our
castaway
status
for
much
too
long
if
they
really
had
good
intentions
toward
us
tortured
by
the
growling
of
his
wellbuilt
stomach
ned
land
was
getting
more
and
more
riled
and
despite
his
word
of
honor
i
was
in
real
dread
of
an
explosion
when
he
stood
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
men
on
board
for
two
more
hours
ned
lands
rage
increased
the
canadian
shouted
and
pleaded
but
to
no
avail
the
sheetiron
walls
were
deaf
i
didnt
hear
a
single
sound
inside
this
deadseeming
boat
the
vessel
hadnt
stirred
because
i
obviously
would
have
felt
its
hull
vibrating
under
the
influence
of
the
propeller
it
had
undoubtedly
sunk
into
the
watery
deep
and
no
longer
belonged
to
the
outside
world
all
this
dismal
silence
was
terrifying
as
for
our
neglect
our
isolation
in
the
depths
of
this
cell
i
was
afraid
to
guess
at
how
long
it
might
last
little
by
little
hopes
i
had
entertained
after
our
interview
with
the
ships
commander
were
fading
away
the
gentleness
of
the
mans
gaze
the
generosity
expressed
in
his
facial
features
the
nobility
of
his
bearing
all
vanished
from
my
memory
i
saw
this
mystifying
individual
anew
for
what
he
inevitably
must
be
cruel
and
merciless
i
viewed
him
as
outside
humanity
beyond
all
feelings
of
compassion
the
implacable
foe
of
his
fellow
man
toward
whom
he
must
have
sworn
an
undying
hate
but
even
so
was
the
man
going
to
let
us
die
of
starvation
locked
up
in
this
cramped
prison
exposed
to
those
horrible
temptations
to
which
people
are
driven
by
extreme
hunger
this
grim
possibility
took
on
a
dreadful
intensity
in
my
mind
and
fired
by
my
imagination
i
felt
an
unreasoning
terror
run
through
me
conseil
stayed
calm
ned
land
bellowed
just
then
a
noise
was
audible
outside
footsteps
rang
on
the
metal
tiling
the
locks
were
turned
the
door
opened
the
steward
appeared
before
i
could
make
a
single
movement
to
prevent
him
the
canadian
rushed
at
the
poor
man
threw
him
down
held
him
by
the
throat
the
steward
was
choking
in
the
grip
of
those
powerful
hands
conseil
was
already
trying
to
loosen
the
harpooners
hands
from
his
halfsuffocated
victim
and
i
had
gone
to
join
in
the
rescue
when
i
was
abruptly
nailed
to
the
spot
by
these
words
pronounced
in
french
calm
down
mr
land
and
you
professor
kindly
listen
to
me
chapter
10
the
man
of
the
waters
it
was
the
ships
commander
who
had
just
spoken
at
these
words
ned
land
stood
up
quickly
nearly
strangled
the
steward
staggered
out
at
a
signal
from
his
superior
but
such
was
the
commanders
authority
aboard
his
vessel
not
one
gesture
gave
away
the
resentment
that
this
man
must
have
felt
toward
the
canadian
in
silence
we
waited
for
the
outcome
of
this
scene
conseil
in
spite
of
himself
seemed
almost
fascinated
i
was
stunned
arms
crossed
leaning
against
a
corner
of
the
table
the
commander
studied
us
with
great
care
was
he
reluctant
to
speak
further
did
he
regret
those
words
he
had
just
pronounced
in
french
you
would
have
thought
so
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
which
none
of
us
would
have
dreamed
of
interrupting
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
calm
penetrating
voice
i
speak
french
english
german
and
latin
with
equal
fluency
hence
i
could
have
answered
you
as
early
as
our
initial
interview
but
first
i
wanted
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
then
think
things
over
your
four
versions
of
the
same
narrative
perfectly
consistent
by
and
large
established
your
personal
identities
for
me
i
now
know
that
sheer
chance
has
placed
in
my
presence
professor
pierre
aronnax
specialist
in
natural
history
at
the
paris
museum
and
entrusted
with
a
scientific
mission
abroad
his
manservant
conseil
and
ned
land
a
harpooner
of
canadian
origin
aboard
the
abraham
lincoln
a
frigate
in
the
national
navy
of
the
united
states
of
america
i
bowed
in
agreement
the
commander
hadnt
put
a
question
to
me
so
no
answer
was
called
for
this
man
expressed
himself
with
perfect
ease
and
without
a
trace
of
an
accent
his
phrasing
was
clear
his
words
well
chosen
his
facility
in
elocution
remarkable
and
yet
to
me
he
didnt
have
the
feel
of
a
fellow
countryman
he
went
on
with
the
conversation
as
follows
no
doubt
sir
youve
felt
that
i
waited
rather
too
long
before
paying
you
this
second
visit
after
discovering
your
identities
i
wanted
to
weigh
carefully
what
policy
to
pursue
toward
you
i
had
great
difficulty
deciding
some
extremely
inconvenient
circumstances
have
brought
you
into
the
presence
of
a
man
who
has
cut
himself
off
from
humanity
your
coming
has
disrupted
my
whole
existence
unintentionally
i
said
unintentionally
the
stranger
replied
raising
his
voice
a
little
was
it
unintentionally
that
the
abraham
lincoln
hunted
me
on
every
sea
was
it
unintentionally
that
you
traveled
aboard
that
frigate
was
it
unintentionally
that
your
shells
bounced
off
my
ships
hull
was
it
unintentionally
that
mr
ned
land
hit
me
with
his
harpoon
i
detected
a
controlled
irritation
in
these
words
but
there
was
a
perfectly
natural
reply
to
these
charges
and
i
made
it
sir
i
said
youre
surely
unaware
of
the
discussions
that
have
taken
place
in
europe
and
america
with
yourself
as
the
subject
you
dont
realize
that
various
accidents
caused
by
collisions
with
your
underwater
machine
have
aroused
public
passions
on
those
two
continents
ill
spare
you
the
innumerable
hypotheses
with
which
weve
tried
to
explain
this
inexplicable
phenomenon
whose
secret
is
yours
alone
but
please
understand
that
the
abraham
lincoln
chased
you
over
the
pacific
high
seas
in
the
belief
it
was
hunting
some
powerful
marine
monster
which
had
to
be
purged
from
the
ocean
at
all
cost
a
half
smile
curled
the
commanders
lips
then
in
a
calmer
tone
professor
aronnax
he
replied
do
you
dare
claim
that
your
frigate
wouldnt
have
chased
and
cannonaded
an
underwater
boat
as
readily
as
a
monster
this
question
baffled
me
since
commander
farragut
would
certainly
have
shown
no
such
hesitation
he
would
have
seen
it
as
his
sworn
duty
to
destroy
a
contrivance
of
this
kind
just
as
promptly
as
a
gigantic
narwhale
so
you
understand
sir
the
stranger
went
on
that
i
have
a
right
to
treat
you
as
my
enemy
i
kept
quiet
with
good
reason
what
was
the
use
of
debating
such
a
proposition
when
superior
force
can
wipe
out
the
best
arguments
it
took
me
a
good
while
to
decide
the
commander
went
on
nothing
obliged
me
to
grant
you
hospitality
if
i
were
to
part
company
with
you
id
have
no
personal
interest
in
ever
seeing
you
again
i
could
put
you
back
on
the
platform
of
this
ship
that
has
served
as
your
refuge
i
could
sink
under
the
sea
and
i
could
forget
you
ever
existed
wouldnt
that
be
my
right
perhaps
it
would
be
the
right
of
a
savage
i
replied
but
not
that
of
a
civilized
man
professor
the
commander
replied
swiftly
im
not
what
you
term
a
civilized
man
ive
severed
all
ties
with
society
for
reasons
that
i
alone
have
the
right
to
appreciate
therefore
i
obey
none
of
its
regulations
and
i
insist
that
you
never
invoke
them
in
front
of
me
this
was
plain
speaking
a
flash
of
anger
and
scorn
lit
up
the
strangers
eyes
and
i
glimpsed
a
fearsome
past
in
this
mans
life
not
only
had
he
placed
himself
beyond
human
laws
he
had
rendered
himself
independent
out
of
all
reach
free
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
for
who
would
dare
chase
him
to
the
depths
of
the
sea
when
he
thwarted
all
attacks
on
the
surface
what
ship
could
withstand
a
collision
with
his
underwater
monitor
what
armor
plate
no
matter
how
heavy
could
bear
the
thrusts
of
his
spur
no
man
among
men
could
call
him
to
account
for
his
actions
god
if
he
believed
in
him
his
conscience
if
he
had
onethese
were
the
only
judges
to
whom
he
was
answerable
these
thoughts
swiftly
crossed
my
mind
while
this
strange
individual
fell
silent
like
someone
completely
selfabsorbed
i
regarded
him
with
a
mixture
of
fear
and
fascination
in
the
same
way
no
doubt
that
oedipus
regarded
the
sphinx
after
a
fairly
long
silence
the
commander
went
on
with
our
conversation
so
i
had
difficulty
deciding
he
said
but
i
concluded
that
my
personal
interests
could
be
reconciled
with
that
natural
compassion
to
which
every
human
being
has
a
right
since
fate
has
brought
you
here
youll
stay
aboard
my
vessel
youll
be
free
here
and
in
exchange
for
that
freedom
moreover
totally
related
to
it
ill
lay
on
you
just
one
condition
your
word
that
youll
submit
to
it
will
be
sufficient
go
on
sir
i
replied
i
assume
this
condition
is
one
an
honest
man
can
accept
yes
sir
just
this
its
possible
that
certain
unforeseen
events
may
force
me
to
confine
you
to
your
cabins
for
some
hours
or
even
for
some
days
as
the
case
may
be
since
i
prefer
never
to
use
violence
i
expect
from
you
in
such
a
case
even
more
than
in
any
other
your
unquestioning
obedience
by
acting
in
this
way
i
shield
you
from
complicity
i
absolve
you
of
all
responsibility
since
i
myself
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
see
what
you
arent
meant
to
see
do
you
accept
this
condition
so
things
happened
on
board
that
were
quite
odd
to
say
the
least
things
never
to
be
seen
by
people
not
placing
themselves
beyond
societys
laws
among
all
the
surprises
the
future
had
in
store
for
me
this
would
not
be
the
mildest
we
accept
i
replied
only
ill
ask
your
permission
sir
to
address
a
question
to
you
just
one
go
ahead
sir
you
said
wed
be
free
aboard
your
vessel
completely
then
i
would
ask
what
you
mean
by
this
freedom
why
the
freedom
to
come
go
see
and
even
closely
observe
everything
happening
hereexcept
under
certain
rare
circumstancesin
short
the
freedom
we
ourselves
enjoy
my
companions
and
i
it
was
obvious
that
we
did
not
understand
each
other
pardon
me
sir
i
went
on
but
thats
merely
the
freedom
that
every
prisoner
has
the
freedom
to
pace
his
cell
thats
not
enough
for
us
nevertheless
it
will
have
to
do
what
we
must
give
up
seeing
our
homeland
friends
and
relatives
ever
again
yes
sir
but
giving
up
that
intolerable
earthly
yoke
that
some
men
call
freedom
is
perhaps
less
painful
than
you
think
by
thunder
ned
land
shouted
ill
never
promise
i
wont
try
getting
out
of
here
i
didnt
ask
for
such
a
promise
mr
land
the
commander
replied
coldly
sir
i
replied
flaring
up
in
spite
of
myself
youre
taking
unfair
advantage
of
us
this
is
sheer
cruelty
no
sir
its
an
act
of
mercy
youre
my
prisoners
of
war
ive
cared
for
you
when
with
a
single
word
i
could
plunge
you
back
into
the
ocean
depths
you
attacked
me
youve
just
stumbled
on
a
secret
no
living
man
must
probe
the
secret
of
my
entire
existence
do
you
think
ill
send
you
back
to
a
world
that
must
know
nothing
more
of
me
never
by
keeping
you
on
board
it
isnt
you
whom
i
care
for
its
me
these
words
indicated
that
the
commander
pursued
a
policy
impervious
to
arguments
then
sir
i
went
on
you
give
us
quite
simply
a
choice
between
life
and
death
quite
simply
my
friends
i
said
to
a
question
couched
in
these
terms
our
answer
can
be
taken
for
granted
but
no
solemn
promises
bind
us
to
the
commander
of
this
vessel
none
sir
the
stranger
replied
then
in
a
gentler
voice
he
went
on
now
allow
me
to
finish
what
i
have
to
tell
you
ive
heard
of
you
professor
aronnax
you
if
not
your
companions
wont
perhaps
complain
too
much
about
the
stroke
of
fate
that
has
brought
us
together
among
the
books
that
make
up
my
favorite
reading
youll
find
the
work
youve
published
on
the
great
ocean
depths
ive
pored
over
it
youve
taken
your
studies
as
far
as
terrestrial
science
can
go
but
you
dont
know
everything
because
you
havent
seen
everything
let
me
tell
you
professor
you
wont
regret
the
time
you
spend
aboard
my
vessel
youre
going
to
voyage
through
a
land
of
wonders
stunned
amazement
will
probably
be
your
habitual
state
of
mind
it
will
be
a
long
while
before
you
tire
of
the
sights
constantly
before
your
eyes
im
going
to
make
another
underwater
tour
of
the
worldperhaps
my
last
who
knowsand
ill
review
everything
ive
studied
in
the
depths
of
these
seas
that
ive
crossed
so
often
and
you
can
be
my
fellow
student
starting
this
very
day
youll
enter
a
new
element
youll
see
what
no
human
being
has
ever
seen
beforesince
my
men
and
i
no
longer
countand
thanks
to
me
youre
going
to
learn
the
ultimate
secrets
of
our
planet
i
cant
deny
it
the
commanders
words
had
a
tremendous
effect
on
me
he
had
caught
me
on
my
weak
side
and
i
momentarily
forgot
that
not
even
this
sublime
experience
was
worth
the
loss
of
my
freedom
besides
i
counted
on
the
future
to
resolve
this
important
question
so
i
was
content
to
reply
sir
even
though
youve
cut
yourself
off
from
humanity
i
can
see
that
you
havent
disowned
all
human
feeling
were
castaways
whom
youve
charitably
taken
aboard
well
never
forget
that
speaking
for
myself
i
dont
rule
out
that
the
interests
of
science
could
override
even
the
need
for
freedom
which
promises
me
that
in
exchange
our
encounter
will
provide
great
rewards
i
thought
the
commander
would
offer
me
his
hand
to
seal
our
agreement
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
i
regretted
that
one
last
question
i
said
just
as
this
inexplicable
being
seemed
ready
to
withdraw
ask
it
professor
by
what
name
am
i
to
call
you
sir
the
commander
replied
to
you
im
simply
captain
nemo
to
me
you
and
your
companions
are
simply
passengers
on
the
nautilus
latin
nemo
means
no
one
ed
captain
nemo
called
out
a
steward
appeared
the
captain
gave
him
his
orders
in
that
strange
language
i
couldnt
even
identify
then
turning
to
the
canadian
and
conseil
a
meal
is
waiting
for
you
in
your
cabin
he
told
them
kindly
follow
this
man
thats
an
offer
i
cant
refuse
the
harpooner
replied
after
being
confined
for
over
thirty
hours
he
and
conseil
were
finally
out
of
this
cell
and
now
professor
aronnax
our
own
breakfast
is
ready
allow
me
to
lead
the
way
yours
to
command
captain
i
followed
captain
nemo
and
as
soon
as
i
passed
through
the
doorway
i
went
down
a
kind
of
electrically
lit
passageway
that
resembled
a
gangway
on
a
ship
after
a
stretch
of
some
ten
meters
a
second
door
opened
before
me
i
then
entered
a
dining
room
decorated
and
furnished
in
austere
good
taste
inlaid
with
ebony
trim
tall
oaken
sideboards
stood
at
both
ends
of
this
room
and
sparkling
on
their
shelves
were
staggered
rows
of
earthenware
porcelain
and
glass
of
incalculable
value
there
silverplated
dinnerware
gleamed
under
rays
pouring
from
light
fixtures
in
the
ceiling
whose
glare
was
softened
and
tempered
by
delicately
painted
designs
in
the
center
of
this
room
stood
a
table
richly
spread
captain
nemo
indicated
the
place
i
was
to
occupy
be
seated
he
told
me
and
eat
like
the
famished
man
you
must
be
our
breakfast
consisted
of
several
dishes
whose
contents
were
all
supplied
by
the
sea
and
some
foods
whose
nature
and
derivation
were
unknown
to
me
they
were
good
i
admit
but
with
a
peculiar
flavor
to
which
i
would
soon
grow
accustomed
these
various
food
items
seemed
to
be
rich
in
phosphorous
and
i
thought
that
they
too
must
have
been
of
marine
origin
captain
nemo
stared
at
me
i
had
asked
him
nothing
but
he
read
my
thoughts
and
on
his
own
he
answered
the
questions
i
was
itching
to
address
him
most
of
these
dishes
are
new
to
you
he
told
me
but
you
can
consume
them
without
fear
theyre
healthy
and
nourishing
i
renounced
terrestrial
foods
long
ago
and
im
none
the
worse
for
it
my
crew
are
strong
and
full
of
energy
and
they
eat
what
i
eat
so
i
said
all
these
foods
are
products
of
the
sea
yes
professor
the
sea
supplies
all
my
needs
sometimes
i
cast
my
nets
in
our
wake
and
i
pull
them
up
ready
to
burst
sometimes
i
go
hunting
right
in
the
midst
of
this
element
that
has
long
seemed
so
far
out
of
mans
reach
and
i
corner
the
game
that
dwells
in
my
underwater
forests
like
the
flocks
of
old
proteus
king
neptunes
shepherd
my
herds
graze
without
fear
on
the
oceans
immense
prairies
there
i
own
vast
properties
that
i
harvest
myself
and
which
are
forever
sown
by
the
hand
of
the
creator
of
all
things
i
stared
at
captain
nemo
in
definite
astonishment
and
i
answered
him
sir
i
understand
perfectly
how
your
nets
can
furnish
excellent
fish
for
your
table
i
understand
less
how
you
can
chase
aquatic
game
in
your
underwater
forests
but
how
a
piece
of
red
meat
no
matter
how
small
can
figure
in
your
menu
that
i
dont
understand
at
all
nor
i
sir
captain
nemo
answered
me
i
never
touch
the
flesh
of
land
animals
nevertheless
this




i
went
on
pointing
to
a
dish
where
some
slices
of
loin
were
still
left
what
you
believe
to
be
red
meat
professor
is
nothing
other
than
loin
of
sea
turtle
similarly
here
are
some
dolphin
livers
you
might
mistake
for
stewed
pork
my
chef
is
a
skillful
food
processor
who
excels
at
pickling
and
preserving
these
various
exhibits
from
the
ocean
feel
free
to
sample
all
of
these
foods
here
are
some
preserves
of
sea
cucumber
that
a
malaysian
would
declare
to
be
unrivaled
in
the
entire
world
heres
cream
from
milk
furnished
by
the
udders
of
cetaceans
and
sugar
from
the
huge
fucus
plants
in
the
north
sea
and
finally
allow
me
to
offer
you
some
marmalade
of
sea
anemone
equal
to
that
from
the
tastiest
fruits
so
i
sampled
away
more
as
a
curiosity
seeker
than
an
epicure
while
captain
nemo
delighted
me
with
his
incredible
anecdotes
but
this
sea
professor
aronnax
he
told
me
this
prodigious
inexhaustible
wet
nurse
of
a
sea
not
only
feeds
me
she
dresses
me
as
well
that
fabric
covering
you
was
woven
from
the
masses
of
filaments
that
anchor
certain
seashells
as
the
ancients
were
wont
to
do
it
was
dyed
with
purple
ink
from
the
murex
snail
and
shaded
with
violet
tints
that
i
extract
from
a
marine
slug
the
mediterranean
sea
hare
the
perfumes
youll
find
on
the
washstand
in
your
cabin
were
produced
from
the
oozings
of
marine
plants
your
mattress
was
made
from
the
oceans
softest
eelgrass
your
quill
pen
will
be
whalebone
your
ink
a
juice
secreted
by
cuttlefish
or
squid
everything
comes
to
me
from
the
sea
just
as
someday
everything
will
return
to
it
you
love
the
sea
captain
yes
i
love
it
the
sea
is
the
be
all
and
end
all
it
covers
seventenths
of
the
planet
earth
its
breath
is
clean
and
healthy
its
an
immense
wilderness
where
a
man
is
never
lonely
because
he
feels
life
astir
on
every
side
the
sea
is
simply
the
vehicle
for
a
prodigious
unearthly
mode
of
existence
its
simply
movement
and
love
its
living
infinity
as
one
of
your
poets
put
it
and
in
essence
professor
nature
is
here
made
manifest
by
all
three
of
her
kingdoms
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
the
last
of
these
is
amply
represented
by
the

groups
three

classes
of
mollusks
and
three

those
countless
legions
of

an
infinite
order
of
animals
totaling
more
than
13000
species

which
only

the

a
vast
pool

our

with
the

so
to
speak
and
who
can
say
we
wont
end
with
it
here
lies
supreme
tranquility
the
sea
doesnt
belong
to
tyrants
on
its
surface
they
can
still
exercise
their
iniquitous
claims
battle
each

horror
but
thirty
feet
below

their
dominion
ceases
their

fades
their

vanishes
ah
sir
live
live
in
the

here
alone
lies
independence
here
i

captain
nemo
suddenly
fell
silent
in
the
midst
of
this
enthusiastic
outpouring
had
he
let
himself
get
carried
away
past
the
bounds
of
his
habitual
reserve
had
he
said
too
much
for
a
few
moments
he
strolled
up
and
down
all
aquiver
then
his
nerves
grew
calmer
his
facial
features
recovered
their
usual
icy
composure
and
turning
to
me
now
professor
he
said
if
youd
like
to
inspect
the
nautilus
im

the
nautilus
captain
nemo
stood
up
i
followed
him
contrived
at
the
rear
of
the
dining
room
a
double
door
opened
and
i
entered
a
room
whose
dimensions
equaled
the
one
i
had
just
left
it
was
a
library
tall
blackrosewood
bookcases
inlaid
with
copperwork
held
on
their
wide
shelves
a
large
number
of
uniformly
bound
books
these
furnishings
followed
the
contours
of
the
room
their
lower
parts
leading
to
huge
couches
upholstered
in
maroon
leather
and
curved
for
maximum
comfort
light
movable
reading
stands
which
could
be
pushed
away
or
pulled
near
as
desired
allowed
books
to
be
positioned
on
them
for
easy
study
in
the
center
stood
a
huge
table
covered
with
pamphlets
among
which
some
newspapers
long
out
of
date
were
visible
electric
light
flooded
this
whole
harmonious
totality
falling
from
four
frosted
half
globes
set
in
the
scrollwork
of
the
ceiling
i
stared
in
genuine
wonderment
at
this
room
so
ingeniously
laid
out
and
i
couldnt
believe
my
eyes
captain
nemo
i
told
my
host
who
had
just
stretched
out
on
a
couch
this

that
would
do
credit
to
more
than
one
continental
palace
and
i
truly
marvel
to
think
it
can
go
with
you
into
the
deepest
seas
where
could
one
find
greater
silence
or
solitude
professor
captain
nemo
replied
did
your
study
at
the
museum
afford
you
such
a
perfect
retreat
no
sir
and
i
might
add
that
its
quite
a
humble
one
next
to
yours
you
own
6000

7000

professor
aronnax
theyre
my
sole
remaining
ties
with
dry
land
but
i
was
done
with
the
shore
the
day
my
nautilus
submerged
for
the
first
time
under
the
waters
that
day
i
purchased
my
last
volumes
my
last
pamphlets
my
last
newspapers
and
ever
since
ive
chosen
to
believe
that
humanity
no
longer
thinks
or
writes
in
any
event
professor
these
books
are
at
your
disposal
and
you
may
use
them
freely
i
thanked
captain
nemo
and
approached
the
shelves
of
this
library
written
in
every
language
books
on
science
ethics
and
literature
were
there
in
abundance
but
i
didnt
see
a
single
work
on
economicsthey
seemed
to
be
strictly
banned
on
board
one
odd
detail
all
these
books
were
shelved
indiscriminately
without
regard
to
the
language
in
which
they
were
written
and
this
jumble
proved
that
the
nautiluss
captain
could
read
fluently
whatever
volumes
he
chanced
to
pick
up
among
these
books
i
noted
masterpieces
by
the
greats
of
ancient
and
modern
times
in
other
words
all
of
humanitys
finest
achievements
in
history
poetry
fiction
and
science
from
homer
to
victor
hugo
from
xenophon
to
michelet
from
rabelais
to
madame
george
sand
but
science
in
particular
represented
the
major
investment
of
this
library
books
on
mechanics
ballistics
hydrography
meteorology
geography
geology
etc
held
a
place
there
no
less
important
than
works
on
natural
history
and
i
realized
that
they
made
up
the
captains
chief
reading
there
i
saw
the
complete
works
of
humboldt
the
complete
arago
as
well
as
works
by
foucault
henri

quatrefages
john
tyndall
faraday
berthelot
father

maury
louis

etc
plus
the
transactions
of
frances
academy
of
sciences
bulletins
from
the
various
geographical
societies
etc
and
in
a
prime
location
those
two
volumes
on
the
great
ocean
depths
that
had
perhaps
earned
me
this
comparatively
charitable
welcome
from
captain
nemo
among
the
works
of
joseph
bertrand
his
book
entitled
the
founders
of
astronomy
even
gave
me
a
definite
date
and
since
i
knew
it
had
appeared
in
the
course
of
1865
i
concluded
that
the
fitting
out
of
the
nautilus
hadnt
taken
place
before
then
accordingly
three
years
ago
at
the
most
captain
nemo
had
begun
his
underwater
existence
moreover
i
hoped
some
books
even
more
recent
would
permit
me
to
pinpoint
the
date
precisely
but
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
look
for
them
and
i
didnt
want
to
put
off
any
longer
our
stroll
through
the
wonders
of
the
nautilus
sir
i
told
the
captain
thank
you
for
placing
this
library
at
my
disposal
there
are
scientific
treasures
here
and
ill
take
advantage
of
them
this
room
isnt
only
a
library
captain
nemo
said
its
also
a
smoking
room
a
smoking
room
i
exclaimed
then
one
may
smoke
on
board
surely
in
that
case
sir
im
forced
to
believe
that
youve
kept
up
relations
with
havana
none
whatever
the
captain
replied
try
this
cigar
professor
aronnax
and
even
though
it
doesnt
come
from
havana
it
will
satisfy
you
if
youre
a
connoisseur
i
took
the
cigar
offered
me
whose
shape
recalled
those
from
cuba
but
it
seemed
to
be
made
of
gold
leaf
i
lit
it
at
a
small
brazier
supported
by
an
elegant
bronze
stand
and
i
inhaled
my
first
whiffs
with
the
relish
of
a
smoker
who
hasnt
had
a
puff
in
days
its
excellent
i
said
but
its
not
from
the
tobacco
plant
right
the
captain
replied
this
tobacco
comes
from
neither
havana
nor
the
orient
its
a
kind
of
nicotinerich
seaweed
that
the
ocean
supplies
me
albeit
sparingly
do
you
still
miss
your
cubans
sir
captain
i
scorn
them
from
this
day
forward
then
smoke
these
cigars
whenever
you
like
without
debating
their
origin
they
bear
no
government
seal
of
approval
but
i
imagine
theyre
none
the
worse
for
it
on
the
contrary
just
then
captain
nemo
opened
a
door
facing
the
one
by
which
i
had
entered
the
library
and
i
passed
into
an
immense
splendidly
lit
lounge
it
was
a
huge
quadrilateral
with
canted
corners
ten
meters
long
six
wide
five
high
a
luminous
ceiling
decorated
with
delicate
arabesques
distributed
a
soft
clear
daylight
over
all
the
wonders
gathered
in
this
museum
for
a
museum
it
truly
was
in
which
clever
hands
had
spared
no
expense
to
amass
every
natural
and
artistic
treasure
displaying
them
with
the
helterskelter
picturesqueness
that
distinguishes
a
painters
studio
some
thirty
pictures
by
the
masters
uniformly
framed
and
separated
by
gleaming
panoplies
of
arms
adorned
walls
on
which
were
stretched
tapestries
of
austere
design
there
i
saw
canvases
of
the
highest
value
the
likes
of
which
i
had
marveled
at
in
private
european
collections
and
art
exhibitions
the
various
schools
of
the
old
masters
were

and
some
wonderful
miniature

in

modeled
after
antiquitys
finest
originals
stood
on
their
pedestals
in
the
corners
of
this
magnificent
museum
as
the
nautiluss
commander
had
predicted
my
mind
was
already
starting
to
fall
into
that
promised
state
of
stunned
amazement
professor
this
strange
man
then
said
you
must
excuse
the
informality
with
which
i
receive
you
and
the
disorder
reigning
in
this
lounge
sir
i
replied
without
prying
into
who
you
are
might
i
venture
to
identify
you
as
an
artist
a
collector
sir
nothing
more
formerly
i
loved
acquiring
these
beautiful
works
created
by
the
hand
of
man
i
sought
them
greedily
ferreted
them
out
tirelessly
and
ive
been
able
to
gather
some
objects
of
great
value
theyre
my
last
mementos
of
those
shores
that
are
now
dead
for
me
in
my
eyes
your
modern
artists
are
already
as
old
as
the
ancients
theyve
existed
for
2000
or
3000
years
and
i
mix
them
up
in
my
mind
the
masters
are
ageless
what
about
these
composers
i
said
pointing
to
sheet

by
weber
rossini

haydn
meyerbeer

scattered
over
a
full
size
pianoorgan
which
occupied
one
of
the
wall
panels
in
this
lounge
these
composers
captain
nemo
answered
me
are
the
contemporaries
of
orpheus
because
in
the
annals
of
the
dead
all
chronological
differences
fade
and
im
dead
professor
quite
as
dead
as
those
friends
of
yours
sleeping
six
feet
under
captain
nemo
fell
silent
and
seemed
lost
in
reverie
i
regarded
him
with
intense
excitement
silently
analyzing
his
strange
facial
expression
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
corner
of
a
valuable
mosaic
table
he
no
longer
saw
me
he
had
forgotten
my
very
presence
i
didnt
disturb
his
meditations
but
continued
to
pass
in
review
the
curiosities
that
enriched
this
lounge
after
the
works
of
art
natural
rarities
predominated
they
consisted
chiefly
of
plants
shells
and
other
exhibits
from
the
ocean
that
must
have
been
captain
nemos
own
personal
finds
in
the
middle
of
the
lounge
a
jet
of
water
electrically
lit
fell
back
into
a
basin
made
from
a
single
giant
clam
the
delicately
festooned
rim
of
this
shell
supplied
by
the
biggest
mollusk
in
the
class
acephala
measured
about
six
meters
in
circumference
so
it
was
even
bigger
than
those
fine
giant
clams
given
to
king
franois
i
by
the
republic
of
venice
and
which
the
church
of
saintsulpice
in

has
made
into
two
gigantic
holywater
fonts
around
this
basin
inside
elegant
glass
cases
fastened
with
copper
bands
there
were

glee

easily
be

were

for

oozed
by
the
rarest
of
shellfish
some
of
these
pearls
were
bigger
than
a
pigeon
egg
they
more
than
equaled
the
one
that
the
explorer
tavernier
sold
the
shah
of
persia
for
3000000
francs
and
they
surpassed
that
other
pearl
owned
by
the
imam
of
muscat
which
i
had
believed
to
be
unrivaled
in
the
entire
world
consequently
to
calculate
the
value
of
this
collection
was
i
should
say
impossible
captain
nemo
must
have
spent
millions
in
acquiring
these
different
specimens
and
i
was
wondering
what
financial
resources
he
tapped
to
satisfy
his
collectors
fancies
when
these
words
interrupted
me
youre
examining
my
shells
professor
theyre
indeed
able
to
fascinate
a
naturalist
but
for
me
they
have
an
added
charm
since
ive
collected
every
one
of
them
with
my
own
two
hands
and
not
a
sea
on
the
globe
has
escaped
my
investigations
i
understand
captain
i
understand
your
delight
at
strolling
in
the
midst
of
this
wealth
youre
a
man
who
gathers
his
treasure
in
person
no
museum
in
europe
owns
such
a
collection
of
exhibits
from
the
ocean
but
if
i
exhaust
all
my
wonderment
on
them
ill
have
nothing
left
for
the
ship
that
carries
them
i
have
absolutely
no
wish
to
probe
those
secrets
of
yours
but
i
confess
that
my
curiosity
is
aroused
to
the
limit
by
this
nautilus
the
motor
power
it
contains
the
equipment
enabling
it
to
operate
the
ultra
powerful
force
that
brings
it
to
life
i
see
some
instruments
hanging
on
the
walls
of
this
lounge
whose
purposes
are
unknown
to
me
may
i
learn
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
answered
me
ive
said
youd
be
free
aboard
my
vessel
so
no
part
of
the
nautilus
is
offlimits
to
you
you
may
inspect
it
in
detail
and
ill
be
delighted
to
act
as
your
guide
i
dont
know
how
to
thank
you
sir
but
i
wont
abuse
your
good
nature
i
would
only
ask
you
about
the
uses
intended
for
these
instruments
of
physical
measure
professor
these
same
instruments
are
found
in
my
stateroom
where
ill
have
the
pleasure
of
explaining
their
functions
to
you
but
beforehand
come
inspect
the
cabin
set
aside
for
you
you
need
to
learn
how
youll
be
lodged
aboard
the
nautilus
i
followed
captain
nemo
who
via
one
of
the
doors
cut
into
the
lounges
canted
corners
led
me
back
down
the
ships
gangways
he
took
me
to
the
bow
and
there
i
found
not
just
a
cabin
but
an
elegant
stateroom
with
a
bed
a
washstand
and
various
other
furnishings
i
could
only
thank
my
host
your
stateroom
adjoins
mine
he
told
me
opening
a
door
and
mine
leads
into
that
lounge
weve
just
left
i
entered
the
captains
stateroom
it
had
an
austere
almost
monastic
appearance
an
iron
bedstead
a
worktable
some
washstand
fixtures
subdued
lighting
no
luxuries
just
the
bare
necessities
captain
nemo
showed
me
to
a
bench
kindly
be
seated
he
told
me
i
sat
and
he
began
speaking
as
follows
chapter
12
everything
through
electricity
sir
captain
nemo
said
showing
me
the
instruments
hanging
on
the
walls
of
his
stateroom
these
are
the
devices
needed
to
navigate
the
nautilus
here
as
in
the
lounge
i
always
have
them
before
my
eyes
and
they
indicate
my
position
and
exact
heading
in
the
midst
of
the
ocean
youre
familiar
with
some
of
them
such
as
the
thermometer
which
gives
the
temperature
inside
the
nautilus
the
barometer
which
measures
the
heaviness
of
the
outside
air
and
forecasts
changes
in
the
weather
the
humidistat
which
indicates
the
degree
of
dryness
in
the
atmosphere
the
storm
glass
whose
mixture
decomposes
to
foretell
the
arrival
of
tempests
the
compass
which
steers
my
course
the
sextant
which
takes
the
suns
altitude
and
tells
me
my
latitude
chronometers
which
allow
me
to
calculate
my
longitude
and
finally
spyglasses
for
both
day
and
night
enabling
me
to
scrutinize
every
point
of
the
horizon
once
the
nautilus
has
risen
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
these
are
the
normal
navigational
instruments
i
replied
and
im
familiar
with
their
uses
but
no
doubt
these
others
answer
pressing
needs
unique
to
the
nautilus
that
dial
i
see
there
with
the
needle
moving
across
itisnt
it
a
pressure
gauge
it
is
indeed
a
pressure
gauge
its
placed
in
contact
with
the
water
and
it
indicates
the
outside
pressure
on
our
hull
which
in
turn
gives
me
the
depth
at
which
my
submersible
is
sitting
and
these
are
some
new
breed
of
sounding
line
theyre
thermometric
sounding
lines
that
report
water
temperatures
in
the
different
strata
and
these
other
instruments
whose
functions
i
cant
even
guess
here
professor
i
need
to
give
you
some
background
information
captain
nemo
said
so
kindly
hear
me
out
he
fell
silent
for
some
moments
then
he
said
theres
a
powerful
obedient
swift
and
effortless
force
that
can
be
bent
to
any
use
and
which
reigns
supreme
aboard
my
vessel
it
does
everything
it
lights
me
it
warms
me
its
the
soul
of
my
mechanical
equipment
this
force
is
electricity
electricity
i
exclaimed
in
some
surprise
yes
sir
but
captain
you
have
a
tremendous
speed
of
movement
that
doesnt
square
with
the
strength
of
electricity
until
now
its
dynamic
potential
has
remained
quite
limited
capable
of
producing
only
small
amounts
of
power
professor
captain
nemo
replied
my
electricity
isnt
the
runofthemill
variety
and
with
your
permission
ill
leave
it
at
that
i
wont
insist
sir
and
ill
rest
content
with
simply
being
flabbergasted
at
your
results
i
would
ask
one
question
however
which
you
neednt
answer
if
its
indiscreet
the
electric
cells
you
use
to
generate
this
marvelous
force
must
be
depleted
very
quickly
their
zinc
component
for
example
how
do
you
replace
it
since
you
no
longer
stay
in
contact
with
the
shore
that
question
deserves
an
answer
captain
nemo
replied
first
off
ill
mention
that
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
there
exist
veins
of
zinc
iron
silver
and
gold
whose
mining
would
quite
certainly
be
feasible
but
ive
tapped
none
of
these
landbased
metals
and
i
wanted
to
make
demands
only
on
the
sea
itself
for
the
sources
of
my
electricity
the
sea
itself
yes
professor
and
there
was
no
shortage
of
such
sources
in
fact
by
establishing
a
circuit
between
two
wires
immersed
to
different
depths
id
be
able
to
obtain
electricity
through
the
diverging
temperatures
they
experience
but
i
preferred
to
use
a
more
practical
procedure
and
that
is
youre
familiar
with
the
composition
of
salt
water
in
1000
grams
one
finds
965
water
and
about
266
sodium
chloride
then
small
quantities
of
magnesium
chloride
potassium
chloride
magnesium
bromide
sulfate
of
magnesia
calcium
sulfate
and
calcium
carbonate
hence
you
observe
that
sodium
chloride
is
encountered
there
in
significant
proportions
now
then
its
this
sodium
that
i
extract
from
salt
water
and
with
which
i
compose
my
electric
cells
sodium
yes
sir
mixed
with
mercury
it
forms
an
amalgam
that
takes
the
place
of
zinc
in
bunsen
cells
the
mercury
is
never
depleted
only
the
sodium
is
consumed
and
the
sea
itself
gives
me
that
beyond
this
ill
mention
that
sodium
batteries
have
been
found
to
generate
the
greater
energy
and
their
electromotor
strength
is
twice
that
of
zinc
batteries
captain
i
fully
understand
the
excellence
of
sodium
under
the
conditions
in
which
youre
placed
the
sea
contains
it
fine
but
it
still
has
to
be
produced
in
short
extracted
and
how
do
you
accomplish
this
obviously
your
batteries
could
do
the
extracting
but
if
im
not
mistaken
the
consumption
of
sodium
needed
by
your
electric
equipment
would
be
greater
than
the
quantity
youd
extract
it
would
come
about
then
that
in
the
process
of
producing
your
sodium
youd
use
up
more
than
youd
make
accordingly
professor
i
dont
extract
it
with
batteries
quite
simply
i
utilize
the
heat
of
coal
from
the
earth
from
the
earth
i
said
my
voice
going
up
on
the
word
well
say
coal
from
the
seafloor
if
you
prefer
captain
nemo
replied
and
you
can
mine
these
veins
of
underwater
coal
youll
watch
me
work
them
professor
aronnax
i
ask
only
a
little
patience
of
you
since
youll
have
ample
time
to
be
patient
just
remember
one
thing
i
owe
everything
to
the
ocean
it
generates
electricity
and
electricity
gives
the
nautilus
heat
light
motion
and
in
a
word
life
itself
but
not
the
air
you
breathe
oh
i
could
produce
the
air
needed
on
board
but
it
would
be
pointless
since
i
can
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
whenever
i
like
however
even
though
electricity
doesnt
supply
me
with
breathable
air
it
at
least
operates
the
powerful
pumps
that
store
it
under
pressure
in
special
tanks
which
if
need
be
allows
me
to
extend
my
stay
in
the
lower
strata
for
as
long
as
i
want
captain
i
replied
ill
rest
content
with
marveling
youve
obviously
found
what
all
mankind
will
surely
find
one
day
the
true
dynamic
power
of
electricity
im
not
so
certain
theyll
find
it
captain
nemo
replied
icily
but
be
that
as
it
may
youre
already
familiar
with
the
first
use
ive
found
for
this
valuable
force
it
lights
us
and
with
a
uniformity
and
continuity
not
even
possessed
by
sunlight
now
look
at
that
clock
its
electric
it
runs
with
an
accuracy
rivaling
the
finest
chronometers
ive
had
it
divided
into
twentyfour
hours
like
italian
clocks
since
neither
day
nor
night
sun
nor
moon
exist
for
me
but
only
this
artificial
light
that
i
import
into
the
depths
of
the
seas
see
right
now
its
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
thats
perfect
another
use
for
electricity
that
dial
hanging
before
our
eyes
indicates
how
fast
the
nautilus
is
going
an
electric
wire
puts
it
in
contact
with
the
patent
log
this
needle
shows
me
the
actual
speed
of
my
submersible
and



hold
on



just
now
were
proceeding
at
the
moderate
pace
of
fifteen
miles
per
hour
its
marvelous
i
replied
and
i
truly
see
captain
how
right
you
are
to
use
this
force
its
sure
to
take
the
place
of
wind
water
and
steam
but
thats
not
all
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
said
standing
up
and
if
youd
care
to
follow
me
well
inspect
the
nautiluss
stern
in
essence
i
was
already
familiar
with
the
whole
forward
part
of
this
underwater
boat
and
here
are
its
exact
subdivisions
going
from
amidships
to
its
spur
the
dining
room
5
meters
long
and
separated
from
the
library
by
a
watertight
bulkhead
in
other
words
it
couldnt
be
penetrated
by
the
sea
the
library
5
meters
long
the
main
lounge
10
meters
long
separated
from
the
captains
stateroom
by
a
second
watertight
bulkhead
the
aforesaid
stateroom
5
meters
long
mine
25
meters
long
and
finally
air
tanks
75
meters
long
and
extending
to
the
stempost
total
a
length
of
35
meters
doors
were
cut
into
the
watertight
bulkheads
and
were
shut
hermetically
by
means
of
indiarubber
seals
which
insured
complete
safety
aboard
the
nautilus
in
the
event
of
a
leak
in
any
one
section
i
followed
captain
nemo
down
gangways
located
for
easy
transit
and
i
arrived
amidships
there
i
found
a
sort
of
shaft
heading
upward
between
two
watertight
bulkheads
an
iron
ladder
clamped
to
the
wall
led
to
the
shafts
upper
end
i
asked
the
captain
what
this
ladder
was
for
it
goes
to
the
skiff
he
replied
what
you
have
a
skiff
i
replied
in
some
astonishment
surely
an
excellent
longboat
light
and
unsinkable
which
is
used
for
excursions
and
fishing
trips
but
when
you
want
to
set
out
dont
you
have
to
return
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
by
no
means
the
skiff
is
attached
to
the
topside
of
the
nautiluss
hull
and
is
set
in
a
cavity
expressly
designed
to
receive
it
its
completely
decked
over
absolutely
watertight
and
held
solidly
in
place
by
bolts
this
ladder
leads
to
a
manhole
cut
into
the
nautiluss
hull
and
corresponding
to
a
comparable
hole
cut
into
the
side
of
the
skiff
i
insert
myself
through
this
double
opening
into
the

my
crew
close
up
the
hole
belonging
to
the
nautilus
i
close
up
the
one
belonging
to
the
skiff
simply
by
screwing
it
into
place
i
undo
the
bolts
holding
the
skiff

the
submersible
and
the
longboat

with
prodigious
speed
to
the
surface

i
then
open

how
do
you
return

i
dont
professor
aronnax
the
nautilus
returns
to
me
at
your
command
at
my
command
an
electric
wire
connects
me
to
the
ship
i
fire
off
a
telegram
and
thats
that
right
i
said
tipsy
from
all
these
wonders
nothing
to
it
after
passing
the
well
of
the
companionway
that
led
to
the
platform
i
saw
a
cabin
2
meters
long
in
which
conseil
and
ned
land
enraptured
with
their
meal
were
busy
devouring
it
to
the
last
crumb
then
a
door
opened
into
the
galley
3
meters
long
and
located
between
the
vessels
huge
storage
lockers
there
even
more
powerful
and
obedient
than
gas
electricity
did
most
of
the
cooking
arriving
under
the
stoves
wires
transmitted
to
platinum
griddles
a
heat
that
was
distributed
and
sustained
with
perfect
consistency
it
also
heated
a
distilling
mechanism
that
via
evaporation
supplied
excellent
drinking
water
next
to
this
galley
was
a
bathroom
conveniently
laid
out
with
faucets
supplying
hot
or
cold
water
at
will
after
the
galley
came
the
crews
quarters
5
meters
long
but
the
door
was
closed
and
i
couldnt
see
its
accommodations
which
might
have
told
me
the
number
of
men
it
took
to
operate
the
nautilus
at
the
far
end
stood
a
fourth
watertight
bulkhead
separating
the
crews
quarters
from
the
engine
room
a
door
opened
and
i
stood
in
the
compartment
where
captain
nemo
indisputably
a
worldclass
engineer
had
set
up
his
locomotive
equipment
brightly
lit
the
engine
room
measured
at
least
20
meters
in
length
it
was
divided
by
function
into
two
parts
the
first
contained
the
cells
for
generating
electricity
the
second
that
mechanism
transmitting
movement
to
the
propeller
right
off
i
detected
an
odor
permeating
the
compartment
that
was
sui
generis
captain
nemo
noticed
the
negative
impression
it
made
on
me
latin
in
a
class
by
itself
ed
that
he
told
me
is
a
gaseous
discharge
caused
by
our
use
of
sodium
but
its
only
a
mild
inconvenience
in
any
event
every
morning
we
sanitize
the
ship
by
ventilating
it
in
the
open
air
meanwhile
i
examined
the
nautiluss
engine
with
a
fascination
easy
to
imagine
you
observe
captain
nemo
told
me
that
i
use
bunsen
cells
not
ruhmkorff
cells
the
latter
would
be
ineffectual
one
uses
fewer
bunsen
cells
but
theyre
big
and
strong
and
experience
has
proven
their
superiority
the
electricity
generated
here
makes
its
way
to
the
stern
where
electromagnets
of
huge
size
activate
a
special
system
of
levers
and
gears
that
transmit
movement
to
the
propellers
shaft
the
latter
has
a
diameter
of
6
meters
a
pitch
of
75
meters
and
can
do
up
to
120
revolutions
per
minute
and
that
gives
you
a
speed
of
fifty
miles
per
hour
there
lay
a
mystery
but
i
didnt
insist
on
exploring
it
how
could
electricity
work
with
such
power
where
did
this
nearly
unlimited
energy
originate
was
it
in
the
extraordinary
voltage
obtained
from
some
new
kind
of
induction
coil
could
its
transmission
have
been
immeasurably
increased
by
some
unknown
system
of
levers
this
was
the
point
i
couldnt
grasp
authors
note
and
sure
enough
theres
now
talk
of
such
a
discovery
in
which
a
new
set
of
levers
generates
considerable
power
did
its
inventor
meet
up
with
captain
nemo
captain
nemo
i
said
ill
vouch
for
the
results
and
not
try
to
explain
them
ive
seen
the
nautilus
at
work
out
in
front
of
the
abraham
lincoln
and
i
know
where
i
stand
on
its
speed
but
it
isnt
enough
just
to
move
we
have
to
see
where
were
going
we
must
be
able
to
steer
right
or
left
up
or
down
how
do
you
reach
the
lower
depths
where
you
meet
an
increasing
resistance
thats
assessed
in
hundreds
of
atmospheres
how
do
you
rise
back
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
finally
how
do
you
keep
your
ship
at
whatever
level
suits
you
am
i
indiscreet
in
asking
you
all
these
things
not
at
all
professor
the
captain
answered
me
after
a
slight
hesitation
since
youll
never
leave
this
underwater
boat
come
into
the
lounge
its
actually
our
work
room
and
there
youll
learn
the
full
story
about
the
nautilus
chapter
13
some
figures
a
moment
later
we
were
seated
on
a
couch
in
the
lounge
cigars
between
our
lips
the
captain
placed
before
my
eyes
a
working
drawing
that
gave
the
ground
plan
cross
section
and
side
view
of
the
nautilus
then
he
began
his
description
as
follows
here
professor
aronnax
are
the
different
dimensions
of
this
boat
now
transporting
you
its
a
very
long
cylinder
with
conical
ends
it
noticeably
takes
the
shape
of
a
cigar
a
shape
already
adopted
in
london
for
several
projects
of
the
same
kind
the
length
of
this
cylinder
from
end
to
end
is
exactly
seventy
meters
and
its
maximum
breadth
of
beam
is
eight
meters
so
it
isnt
quite
built
on
the
tentoone
ratio
of
your
highspeed
steamers
but
its
lines
are
sufficiently
long
and
their
tapering
gradual
enough
so
that
the
displaced
water
easily
slips
past
and
poses
no
obstacle
to
the
ships
movements
these
two
dimensions
allow
you
to
obtain
via
a
simple
calculation
the
surface
area
and
volume
of
the
nautilus
its
surface
area
totals
101145
square
meters
its
volume
15072
cubic
meterswhich
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
when
its
completely
submerged
it
displaces
1500
cubic
meters
of
water
or
weighs
1500
metric
tons
in
drawing
up
plans
for
a
ship
meant
to
navigate
underwater
i
wanted
it
when
floating
on
the
waves
to
lie
ninetenths
below
the
surface
and
to
emerge
only
onetenth
consequently
under
these
conditions
it
needed
to
displace
only
ninetenths
of
its
volume
hence
135648
cubic
meters
in
other
words
it
was
to
weigh
only
that
same
number
of
metric
tons
so
i
was
obliged
not
to
exceed
this
weight
while
building
it
to
the
aforesaid
dimensions
the
nautilus
is
made
up
of
two
hulls
one
inside
the
other
between
them
joining
them
together
are
iron
tbars
that
give
this
ship
the
utmost
rigidity
in
fact
thanks
to
this
cellular
arrangement
it
has
the
resistance
of
a
stone
block
as
if
it
were
completely
solid
its
plating
cant
give
way
its
selfadhering
and
not
dependent
on
the
tightness
of
its
rivets
and
due
to
the
perfect
union
of
its
materials
the
solidarity
of
its
construction
allows
it
to
defy
the
most
violent
seas
the
two
hulls
are
manufactured
from
boilerplate
steel
whose
relative
density
is
78
times
that
of
water
the
first
hull
has
a
thickness
of
no
less
than
five
centimeters
and
weighs
39496
metric
tons
my
second
hull
the
outer
cover
includes
a
keel
fifty
centimeters
high
by
twentyfive
wide
which
by
itself
weighs
62
metric
tons
this
hull
the
engine
the
ballast
the
various
accessories
and
accommodations
plus
the
bulkheads
and
interior
braces
have
a
combined
weight
of
96152
metric
tons
which
when
added
to
39496
metric
tons
gives
us
the
desired
total
of
135648
metric
tons
clear
clear
i
replied
so
the
captain
went
on
when
the
nautilus
lies
on
the
waves
under
these
conditions
onetenth
of
it
does
emerge
above
water
now
then
if
i
provide
some
ballast
tanks
equal
in
capacity
to
that
onetenth
hence
able
to
hold
15072
metric
tons
and
if
i
fill
them
with
water
the
boat
then
displaces
15072
metric
tonsor
it
weighs
that
muchand
it
would
be
completely
submerged
thats
what
comes
about
professor
these
ballast
tanks
exist
within
easy
access
in
the
lower
reaches
of
the
nautilus
i
open
some
stopcocks
the
tanks
fill
the
boat
sinks
and
its
exactly
flush
with
the
surface
of
the
water
fine
captain
but
now
we
come
to
a
genuine
difficulty
youre
able
to
lie
flush
with
the
surface
of
the
ocean
that
i
understand
but
lower
down
while
diving
beneath
that
surface
isnt
your
submersible
going
to
encounter
a
pressure
and
consequently
undergo
an
upward
thrust
that
must
be
assessed
at
one
atmosphere
per
every
thirty
feet
of
water
hence
at
about
one
kilogram
per
each
square
centimeter
precisely
sir
then
unless
you
fill
up
the
whole
nautilus
i
dont
see
how
you
can
force
it
down
into
the
heart
of
these
liquid
masses
professor
captain
nemo
replied
static
objects
mustnt
be
confused
with
dynamic
ones
or
well
be
open
to
serious
error
comparatively
little
effort
is
spent
in
reaching
the
oceans
lower
regions
because
all
objects
have
a
tendency
to
become
sinkers
follow
my
logic
here
im
all
ears
captain
when
i
wanted
to
determine
what
increase
in
weight
the
nautilus
needed
to
be
given
in
order
to
submerge
i
had
only
to
take
note
of
the
proportionate
reduction
in
volume
that
salt
water
experiences
in
deeper
and
deeper
strata
thats
obvious
i
replied
now
then
if
water
isnt
absolutely
incompressible
at
least
it
compresses
very
little
in
fact
according
to
the
most
recent
calculations
this
reduction
is
only
0000436
per
atmosphere
or
per
every
thirty
feet
of
depth
for
instance
to
go
1000
meters
down
i
must
take
into
account
the
reduction
in
volume
that
occurs
under
a
pressure
equivalent
to
that
from
a
1000meter
column
of
water
in
other
words
under
a
pressure
of
100
atmospheres
in
this
instance
the
reduction
would
be
00436
consequently
id
have
to
increase
my
weight
from
15072
metric
tons
to
151377
so
the
added
weight
would
only
be
657
metric
tons
thats
all
thats
all
professor
aronnax
and
the
calculation
is
easy
to
check
now
then
i
have
supplementary
ballast
tanks
capable
of
shipping
100
metric
tons
of
water
so
i
can
descend
to
considerable
depths
when
i
want
to
rise
again
and
lie
flush
with
the
surface
all
i
have
to
do
is
expel
that
water
and
if
i
desire
that
the
nautilus
emerge
above
the
waves
to
onetenth
of
its
total
capacity
i
empty
all
the
ballast
tanks
completely
this
logic
backed
up
by
figures
left
me
without
a
single
objection
i
accept
your
calculations
captain
i
replied
and
id
be
illmannered
to
dispute
them
since
your
daily
experience
bears
them
out
but
at
this
juncture
i
have
a
hunch
that
were
still
left
with
one
real
difficulty
whats
that
sir
when
youre
at
a
depth
of
1000
meters
the
nautiluss
plating
bears
a
pressure
of
100
atmospheres
if
at
this
point
you
want
to
empty
the
supplementary
ballast
tanks
in
order
to
lighten
your
boat
and
rise
to
the
surface
your
pumps
must
overcome
that
pressure
of
100
atmospheres
which
is
100
kilograms
per
each
square
centimeter
this
demands
a
strength
that
electricity
alone
can
give
me
captain
nemo
said
swiftly
sir
i
repeat
the
dynamic
power
of
my
engines
is
nearly
infinite
the
nautiluss
pumps
have
prodigious
strength
as
you
must
have
noticed
when
their
waterspouts
swept
like
a
torrent
over
the
abraham
lincoln
besides
i
use
my
supplementary
ballast
tanks
only
to
reach
an
average
depth
of
1500
to
2000
meters
and
that
with
a
view
to
conserving
my
machinery
accordingly
when
i
have
a
mind
to
visit
the
ocean
depths
two
or
three
vertical
leagues
beneath
the
surface
i
use
maneuvers
that
are
more
timeconsuming
but
no
less
infallible
what
are
they
captain
i
asked
here
im
naturally
led
into
telling
you
how
the
nautilus
is
maneuvered
i
cant
wait
to
find
out
in
order
to
steer
this
boat
to
port
or
starboard
in
short
to
make
turns
on
a
horizontal
plane
i
use
an
ordinary
widebladed
rudder
thats
fastened
to
the
rear
of
the
sternpost
and
worked
by
a
wheel
and
tackle
but
i
can
also
move
the
nautilus
upward
and
downward
on
a
vertical
plane
by
the
simple
method
of
slanting
its
two
fins
which
are
attached
to
its
sides
at
its
center
of
flotation
these
fins
are
flexible
able
to
assume
any
position
and
can
be
operated
from
inside
by
means
of
powerful
levers
if
these
fins
stay
parallel
with
the
boat
the
latter
moves
horizontally
if
they
slant
the
nautilus
follows
the
angle
of
that
slant
and
under
its
propellers
thrust
either
sinks
on
a
diagonal
as
steep
as
it
suits
me
or
rises
on
that
diagonal
and
similarly
if
i
want
to
return
more
swiftly
to
the
surface
i
throw
the
propeller
in
gear
and
the
waters
pressure
makes
the
nautilus
rise
vertically
as
an
air
balloon
inflated
with
hydrogen
lifts
swiftly
into
the
skies
bravo
captain
i
exclaimed
but
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
how
can
your
helmsman
follow
the
course
youve
given
him
my
helmsman
is
stationed
behind
the
windows
of
a
pilothouse
which
protrudes
from
the
topside
of
the
nautiluss
hull
and
is
fitted
with
biconvex
glass
is
glass
capable
of
resisting
such
pressures
perfectly
capable
though
fragile
on
impact
crystal
can
still
offer
considerable
resistance
in
1864
during
experiments
on
fishing
by
electric
light
in
the
middle
of
the
north
sea
glass
panes
less
than
seven
millimeters
thick
were
seen
to
resist
a
pressure
of
sixteen
atmospheres
all
the
while
letting
through
strong
heatgenerating
rays
whose
warmth
was
unevenly
distributed
now
then
i
use
glass
windows
measuring
no
less
than
twentyone
centimeters
at
their
centers
in
other
words
theyve
thirty
times
the
thickness
fair
enough
captain
but
if
were
going
to
see
we
need
light
to
drive
away
the
dark
and
in
the
midst
of
the
murky
waters
i
wonder
how
your
helmsman
can
set
astern
of
the
pilothouse
is
a
powerful
electric
reflector
whose
rays
light
up
the
sea
for
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
oh
bravo
bravo
three
times
over
captain
that
explains
the
phosphorescent
glow
from
this
socalled
narwhale
that
so
puzzled
us
scientists
pertinent
to
this
ill
ask
you
if
the
nautiluss
running
afoul
of
the
scotia
which
caused
such
a
great
uproar
was
the
result
of
an
accidental
encounter
entirely
accidental
sir
i
was
navigating
two
meters
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
when
the
collision
occurred
however
i
could
see
that
it
had
no
dire
consequences
none
sir
but
as
for
your
encounter
with
the
abraham
lincoln




professor
that
troubled
me
because
its
one
of
the
best
ships
in
the
gallant
american
navy
but
they
attacked
me
and
i
had
to
defend
myself
all
the
same
i
was
content
simply
to
put
the
frigate
in
a
condition
where
it
could
do
me
no
harm
it
wont
have
any
difficulty
getting
repairs
at
the
nearest
port
ah
commander
i
exclaimed
with
conviction
your
nautilus
is
truly
a
marvelous
boat
yes
professor
captain
nemo
replied
with
genuine
excitement
and
i
love
it
as
if
it
were
my
own
flesh
and
blood
aboard
a
conventional
ship
facing
the
oceans
perils
danger
lurks
everywhere
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
your
chief
sensation
is
the
constant
feeling
of
an
underlying
chasm
as
the
dutchman
jansen
so
aptly
put
it
but
below
the
waves
aboard
the
nautilus
your
heart
never
fails
you
there
are
no
structural
deformities
to
worry
about
because
the
double
hull
of
this
boat
has
the
rigidity
of
iron
no
rigging
to
be
worn
out
by
rolling
and
pitching
on
the
waves
no
sails
for
the
wind
to
carry
off
no
boilers
for
steam
to
burst
open
no
fires
to
fear
because
this
submersible
is
made
of
sheet
iron
not
wood
no
coal
to
run
out
of
since
electricity
is
its
mechanical
force
no
collisions
to
fear
because
it
navigates
the
watery
deep
all
by
itself
no
storms
to
brave
because
just
a
few
meters
beneath
the
waves
it
finds
absolute
tranquility
there
sir
theres
the
ideal
ship
and
if
its
true
that
the
engineer
has
more
confidence
in
a
craft
than
the
builder
and
the
builder
more
than
the
captain
himself
you
can
understand
the
utter
abandon
with
which
i
place
my
trust
in
this
nautilus
since
im
its
captain
builder
and
engineer
all
in
one
captain
nemo
spoke
with
winning
eloquence
the
fire
in
his
eyes
and
the
passion
in
his
gestures
transfigured
him
yes
he
loved
his
ship
the
same
way
a
father
loves
his
child
but
one
question
perhaps
indiscreet
naturally
popped
up
and
i
couldnt
resist
asking
it
youre
an
engineer
then
captain
nemo
yes
professor
he
answered
me
i
studied
in
london
paris
and
new
york
back
in
the
days
when
i
was
a
resident
of
the
earths
continents
but
how
were
you
able
to
build
this
wonderful
nautilus
in
secret
each
part
of
it
professor
aronnax
came
from
a
different
spot
on
the
globe
and
reached
me
at
a
cover
address
its
keel
was
forged
by
creusot
in
france
its
propeller
shaft
by
pen

co
in
london
the
sheetiron
plates
for
its
hull
by
lairds
in
liverpool
its
propeller
by
scotts
in
glasgow
its
tanks
were
manufactured
by
cail

co
in
paris
its
engine
by
krupp
in
prussia
its
spur
by
the
motala
workshops
in
sweden
its
precision
instruments
by
hart
bros
in
new
york
etc
and
each
of
these
suppliers
received
my
specifications
under
a
different
name
but
i
went
on
once
these
parts
were
manufactured
didnt
they
have
to
be
mounted
and
adjusted
professor
i
set
up
my
workshops
on
a
deserted
islet
in
midocean
there
our
nautilus
was
completed
by
me
and
my
workmen
in
other
words
by
my
gallant
companions
whom
ive
molded
and
educated
then
when
the
operation
was
over
we
burned
every
trace
of
our
stay
on
that
islet
which
if
i
could
have
id
have
blown
up
from
all
this
may
i
assume
that
such
a
boat
costs
a
fortune
an
iron
ship
professor
aronnax
runs
1125
francs
per
metric
ton
now
then
the
nautilus
has
a
burden
of
1500
metric
tons
consequently
it
cost
1687000
francs
hence
2000000
francs
including
its
accommodations
and
4000000
or
5000000
with
all
the
collections
and
works
of
art
it
contains
one
last
question
captain
nemo
ask
professor
youre
rich
then
infinitely
rich
sir
and
without
any
trouble
i
could
pay
off
the
tenbillionfranc
french
national
debt
i
gaped
at
the
bizarre
individual
who
had
just
spoken
these
words
was
he
playing
on
my
credulity
time
would
tell
chapter
14
the
black
current
the
part
of
the
planet
earth
that
the
seas
occupy
has
been
assessed
at
3832558
square
myriameters
hence
more
than
38000000000
hectares
this
liquid
mass
totals
2250000000
cubic
miles
and
could
form
a
sphere
with
a
diameter
of
sixty
leagues
whose
weight
would
be
three
quintillion
metric
tons
to
appreciate
such
a
number
we
should
remember
that
a
quintillion
is
to
a
billion
what
a
billion
is
to
one
in
other
words
there
are
as
many
billions
in
a
quintillion
as
ones
in
a
billion
now
then
this
liquid
mass
nearly
equals
the
total
amount
of
water
that
has
poured
through
all
the
earths
rivers
for
the
past
40000
years
during
prehistoric
times
an
era
of
fire
was
followed
by
an
era
of
water
at
first
there
was
ocean
everywhere
then
during
the
silurian
period
the
tops
of
mountains
gradually
appeared
above
the
waves
islands
emerged
disappeared
beneath
temporary
floods
rose
again
were
fused
to
form
continents
and
finally
the
earths
geography
settled
into
what
we
have
today
solid
matter
had
wrested
from
liquid
matter
some
37657000
square
miles
hence
12916000000
hectares
the
outlines
of
the
continents
allow
the
seas
to
be
divided
into
five
major
parts
the
frozen
arctic
and
antarctic
oceans
the
indian
ocean
the

and
the

the

between

of
145

its
the
most
tranquil
of
the

its

are
wide
and
slowmoving
its
tides
moderate
its
rainfall
abundant
and
this
was
the
ocean
that
i
was
first
destined
to
cross
under
these
strangest
of
auspices
if
you
dont
mind
professor
captain
nemo
told
me
well
determine
our
exact
position
and
fix
the
starting
point
of
our
voyage
its
fifteen
minutes
before
noon
im
going
to
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
water
the
captain
pressed
an
electric
bell
three
times
the
pumps
began
to
expel
water
from
the
ballast
tanks
on
the
pressure
gauge
a
needle
marked
the
decreasing
pressures
that
indicated
the
nautiluss
upward
progress
then
the
needle
stopped
here
we
are
the
captain
said
i
made
my
way
to
the
central
companionway
which
led
to
the
platform
i
climbed
its
metal
steps
passed
through
the
open
hatches
and
arrived
topside
on
the
nautilus
the
platform
emerged
only
eighty
centimeters
above
the
waves
the
nautiluss
bow
and
stern
boasted
that
spindleshaped
outline
that
had
caused
the
ship
to
be
compared
appropriately
to
a
long
cigar
i
noted
the
slight
overlap
of
its
sheetiron
plates
which
resembled
the
scales
covering
the
bodies
of
our
big
land
reptiles
so
i
had
a
perfectly
natural
explanation
for
why
despite
the
best
spyglasses
this
boat
had
always
been
mistaken
for
a
marine
animal
near
the
middle
of
the
platform
the
skiff
was
half
set
in
the
ships
hull
making
a
slight
bulge
fore
and
aft
stood
two
cupolas
of
moderate
height
their
sides
slanting
and
partly
inset
with
heavy
biconvex
glass
one
reserved
for
the
helmsman
steering
the
nautilus
the
other
for
the
brilliance
of
the
powerful
electric
beacon
lighting
his
way
the
sea
was
magnificent
the
skies
clear
this
long
aquatic
vehicle
could
barely
feel
the
broad
undulations
of
the
ocean
a
mild
breeze
out
of
the
east
rippled
the
surface
of
the
water
free
of
all
mist
the
horizon
was
ideal
for
taking
sights
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
not
a
reef
not
an
islet
no

abraham
lincoln
a
deserted
immenseness
raising
his
sextant
captain
nemo
took
the
altitude
of
the
sun
which
would
give
him
his
latitude
he
waited
for
a
few
minutes
until
the
orb
touched
the
rim
of
the
horizon
while
he
was
taking
his
sights
he
didnt
move
a
muscle

steadier
in

out
of

noon
he
said
professor
whenever
youre
ready



i
took
one
last
look
at
the
sea
a
little
yellowish
near
the
landing
places
of
japan
and
i
went
below
again
to
the
main
lounge
there
the
captain
fixed
his
position
and
used
a
chronometer
to
calculate
his
longitude
which
he
doublechecked
against
his
previous
observations
of
hour
angles
then
he
told
me
professor
aronnax
were
in
longitude
137
degrees
15
west
west
of
which
meridian
i
asked
quickly
hoping
the
captains
reply
might
give
me
a
clue
to
his
nationality
sir
he
answered
me
i
have
chronometers
variously
set
to
the
meridians
of
paris
greenwich
and
washington
dc
but
in
your
honor
ill
use
the
one
for
paris
this
reply
told
me
nothing
i
bowed
and
the
commander
went
on
were
in
longitude
137
degrees
15
west
of
the

i
replied
and
now
professor
the
captain
added
ill
leave
you
to
your
intellectual
pursuits
ive

myself
lost
in
my
thoughts
they
all
centered
on
the
nautiluss
commander
would
i
ever
learn
the
nationality
of
this
eccentric
man
who
had
boasted
of
having
none
his
sworn
hate
for
humanity
a
hate
that
perhaps
was
bent
on
some
dreadful
revengewhat
had
provoked
it
was
he
one
of
those
unappreciated
scholars
one
of
those
geniuses
embittered
by
the
world
as
conseil
expressed
it
a
latterday
galileo
or
maybe
one
of
those
men
of
science
like
americas
commander
maury
whose
careers
were
ruined
by
political
revolutions
i
couldnt
say
yet
as
for
me
whom
fate
had
just
brought
aboard
his
vessel
whose
life
he
had
held
in
the
balance
he
had
received
me
coolly
but
hospitably
only
he
never
took
the
hand
i
extended
to
him
he
never
extended
his
own
for
an
entire
hour
i
was
deep
in
these
musings
trying
to
probe
this
mystery
that
fascinated
me
so
then
my
eyes
focused
on
a
huge
world
map
displayed
on
the
table
and
i
put
my
finger
on
the
very
spot
where
our
justdetermined
longitude
and
latitude
intersected
like
the
continents
the
sea
has
its
rivers
these
are
exclusive
currents
that
can
be
identified
by
their
temperature
and
color
the
most
remarkable
being
the
one
called
the
gulf
stream
science
has
defined
the
global
paths
of
five
chief
currents
one
in
the
north
atlantic
a
second
in
the
south
atlantic
a
third
in
the
north
pacific
a
fourth
in
the
south
pacific
and
a
fifth
in
the
southern
indian
ocean
also
its
likely
that
a
sixth
current
used
to
exist
in
the
northern
indian
ocean
when
the
caspian
and
aral
seas
joined
up
with
certain
large
asian
lakes
to
form
a
single
uniform
expanse
of
water
now
then
at
the
spot
indicated
on
the
world
map
one
of
these
seagoing
rivers
was
rolling
by
the
kuroshio

by
perpendicular

the

the

up
the
shores
of

and
curves
into
the
north
pacific
as
far
as
the
aleutian
islands
carrying
along
trunks
of
camphor
trees

other
local

about
to
cross
i
watched
it
on
the
map
with
my
eyes
i
saw
it
lose
itself
in
the
immenseness
of
the

and
i
felt
myself
swept
along
with
it
when

conseil
appeared
in
the

my
two
gallant

petrified
at
the
sight
of
the
wonders
on

where
are

the
canadian
exclaimed
in
the
quebec
museum
begging
masters
pardon
conseil
answered
but
this
seems
more
like
the
sommerard
artifacts
exhibition
my
friends
i
replied
signaling
them
to
enter
youre
in
neither
canada
nor
france
but
securely
aboard
the
nautilus
fifty
meters
below
sea
level
if
master
says
so
then
so
be
it
conseil
answered
but
in
all
honesty
this
lounge
is
enough
to
astonish
even
someone
flemish
like
myself
indulge
your
astonishment
my
friend
and
have
a
look
because
theres
plenty
of
work
here
for
a
classifier
of
your

bending
over

questioned
me
about
my
interview
with
captain
nemo
had
i
discovered
who
he
was
where
he
came
from
where
he
was
heading
how
deep
he
was
taking
us
in
short
a
thousand
questions
i
had
no
time
to
answer
i
told
him
everything
i
knewor
rather
everything
i
didnt
knowand
i
asked
him
what
he
had
seen
or
heard
on
his
part
havent
seen
or
heard
a
thing
the
canadian
replied
i
havent
even
spotted
the
crew

this

by
any
chance
could
they
be
electric

electric
oh
ye

im
unable
to
answer
you
mr

and
trust
me
on
this
for
the
time
being
get
rid
of
these
notions
of
taking
over
the
nautilus
or
escaping
from
it
this
boat
is
a
masterpiece
of
modern
technology
and
id
be
sorry
to
have
missed
it
many
people
would
welcome
the
circumstances
that
have
been
handed
us
just
to
walk
in
the
midst
of
these
wonders
so
keep
calm
and
lets
see
whats
happening
around
us
see
the
harpooner
exclaimed
theres
nothing
to

nothing
well
ever
see
from
this
sheetiron

simply
running
around
blindfolded
ned

was
just
pronouncing
these
last
words
when
we
were
suddenly
plunged
into
darkness
utter
darkness
the
ceiling
lights
went
out
so
quickly
my
eyes
literally
ached
just
as
if
we
had
experienced
the
opposite
sensation
of
going
from
the
deepest
gloom
to
the
brightest
sunlight
we
stood
stockstill
not
knowing
what
surprise
was
waiting
for
us
whether
pleasant
or
unpleasant
but
a
sliding
sound
became
audible
you
could
tell
that
some
panels
were
shifting
over
the
nautiluss
sides
its
the
beginning
of
the
end
ned

conseil
muttered
suddenly
through
two
oblong
openings
daylight
appeared
on
both
sides
of
the
lounge
the
liquid
masses
came
into
view
brightly
lit
by
the
ships
electric
outpourings
we
were
separated
from
the
sea
by
two
panes
of
glass
initially
i
shuddered
at
the
thought
that
these
fragile
partitions
could
break
but
strong
copper
bands
secured
them
giving
them
nearly
infinite
resistance
the
sea
was
clearly
visible
for
a
onemile
radius
around
the
nautilus
what
a
sight
what
pen
could
describe
it
who
could
portray
the
effects
of
this
light
through
these
translucent
sheets
of
water
the
subtlety
of
its
progressive
shadings
into
the
oceans
upper
and
lower
strata
the
transparency
of
salt
water
has
long
been
recognized
its
clarity
is
believed
to
exceed
that
of
spring
water
the
mineral
and
organic
substances
it
holds
in
suspension
actually
increase
its
translucency
in
certain
parts
of
the
caribbean
sea
you
can
see
the
sandy
bottom
with
startling
distinctness
as
deep
as
145
meters
down
and
the
penetrating
power
of
the
suns
rays
seems
to
give
out
only
at
a
depth
of
300
meters
but
in
this
fluid
setting
traveled
by
the
nautilus
our
electric
glow
was
being
generated
in
the
very
heart
of
the
waves
it
was
no
longer
illuminated
water
it
was
liquid
light
if
we
accept
the
hypotheses
of
the
microbiologist
ehrenbergwho
believes
that
these
underwater
depths
are
lit
up
by
phosphorescent

has
certainly
saved
one
of
her
most
prodigious
sights
for
residents
of
the
sea
and
i
could
judge
for
myself
from
the
thousandfold
play
of
the
light
on
both
sides
i
had
windows
opening
over
these
unexplored
depths
the
darkness
in
the
lounge
enhanced
the
brightness
outside
and
we
stared
as
if
this
clear
glass
were
the
window
of
an
immense
aquarium
the
nautilus
seemed
to
be
standing
still
this
was
due
to
the
lack
of
landmarks
but
streaks
of
water
parted
by
the
ships
spur
sometimes
threaded
before
our
eyes
with
extraordinary
speed
in
wonderment
we
leaned
on
our
elbows
before
these
show
windows
and
our
stunned
silence
remained
unbroken
until
conseil
said
you
wanted
to
see
something
ned
my
friend
well
now
you
have
something
to
see
how
unusual
the
canadian
put
in
setting
aside
his
tantrums
and
getaway
schemes
while
submitting
to
this
irresistible
allure
a
man
would
go
an
even
greater
distance
just
to
stare
at
such
a
sight
ah
i
exclaimed
i
see
our
captains
way
of
life
hes
found
himself
a
separate
world
that
saves
its
most
astonishing
wonders
just
for
him
but
where
are
the
fish
the
canadian
ventured
to
observe
i
dont
see
any
fish
why
would
you
care
ned
my
friend
conseil
replied
since
you
have
no
knowledge
of
them
me
a
fisherman
ned
land
exclaimed
and
on
this
subject
a
dispute
arose
between
the
two
friends
since
both
were
knowledgeable
about
fish
but
from
totally
different
standpoints
everyone
knows
that
fish
make
up
the
fourth
and
last
class
in
the
vertebrate
branch
they
have
been
quite
aptly
defined
as
coldblooded
vertebrates
with
a
double
circulatory
system
breathing
through
gills
and
designed
to
live
in
water
they
consist
of
two
distinct
series
the
series
of
bony
fish
in
other
words
those
whose
spines
have
vertebrae
made
of
bone
and
cartilaginous
fish
in
other
words
those
whose
spines
have
vertebrae
made
of
cartilage
possibly
the
canadian
was
familiar
with
this
distinction
but
conseil
knew
far
more
about
it
and
since
he
and
ned
were
now
fast
friends
he
just
had
to
show
off
so
he
told
the
harpooner
ned
my
friend
youre
a
slayer
of
fish
a
highly
skilled
fisherman
youve
caught
a
large
number
of
these
fascinating
animals
but
ill
bet
you
dont
know
how
theyre
classified
sure
i
do
the
harpooner
replied
in
all
seriousness
theyre
classified
into
fish
we
eat
and
fish
we
dont
eat
spoken
like
a
true
glutton
conseil
replied
but
tell
me
are
you
familiar
with
the
differences
between
bony
fish
and
cartilaginous
fish
just
maybe
conseil
and
how
about
the
subdivisions
of
these
two
large
classes
i
havent
the
foggiest
notion
the
canadian
replied
all
right
listen
and
learn
ned
my
friend
bony
fish
are
subdivided
into
six
orders
primo
the
acanthopterygians
whose
upper
jaw
is
fully
formed
and
freemoving
and
whose
gills
take
the
shape
of
a
comb
this
order
consists
of
fifteen
families
in
other
words
threequarters
of
all
known
fish
example
the
common
perch
pretty
fair

abdomen
to
the
rear
of
the
pectorals
but
arent
attached
to
the
shoulder
bone
an
order
thats
divided
into
five
families
and
makes
up
the
great
majority
of
freshwater
fish
examples
carp
pike
ugh
the
canadian
put
in
with
distinct
scorn
you
can
keep
the
freshwater
fish
tertio
conseil
said
the
subbrachians
whose
pelvic
fins
are
attached
under
the
pectorals
and
hang
directly
from
the
shoulder

this
order
contains
four
families
examples
flatfish
such
as
sole
turbot
dab
plaice
brill
etc
excellent
really
excellent
the
harpooner
exclaimed
interested
in
fish
only
from
an
edible
viewpoint
quarto
conseil
went
on
unabashed
the
apods
with
long
bodies
that
lack
pelvic
fins
and
are
covered
by
a
heavy
often
glutinous
skin
an
order
consisting
of
only
one
family
examples
common
eels
and
electric
eels
soso
just
soso
ned

replied
quinto
conseil
said
the
lophobranchians
which
have
fully
formed
freemoving
jaws
but
whose
gills
consist
of
little
tufts
arranged
in
pairs
along
their
gill
arches
this
order
includes
only
one
family
examples
seahorses
and
dragonfish
bad
very
bad
the
harpooner
replied
sexto
and
last
conseil
said
the
plectognaths
whose
maxillary
bone
is
firmly
attached
to
the
side
of
the
intermaxillary
that
forms
the
jaw
and
whose
palate
arch
is
locked
to
the
skull
by
sutures
that
render
the
jaw
immovable
an
order
lacking
true
pelvic
fins
and
which
consists
of
two
families
examples
puffers
and
moonfish
theyre

grasping
all
this
ned

asked
the
scholarly
conseil
not
a
lick
of
it
conseil
my
friend
the
harpooner
replied
but
keep
going
because
you
fill
me
with
fascination
as
for
cartilaginous

conseil
went
on
unflappably
they
consist

three
orders
good

the
cyclostomes

no
i
replied
because
an
aquarium
is
nothing
more
than
a

these

although
the
fine

was
a

he
was
no

i
doubt
that
he
could
tell
a
bonito

a
tuna
in
short
he
was
the
exact
opposite
of
the
canadian
who
knew
nothing
about
classification
but
could
instantly
put
a

the

not

cavorting

the

a

of

with

rows
of

quivering
on
both

nothing
could
have

than

among

spotted
much
to
my
glee
a
chinese
ray
yellowish
on
its
topside
a
dainty
pink
on
its
belly
and
armed
with
three
stings
behind
its
eyes
a
rare
species
whose
very
existence
was
still
doubted
in
lacpdes

since
that
pioneering

of
fish

seen
one
only

for
two
hours
a
whole

army
escorted
the

cavorting

they
competed
with
each
other
in
beauty
radiance

could
distinguish
some
green

with
pairs
of
black

white

was
in
ecstasy
over
the
verve
of
their
movements

the
beauty

their
forms
never

every

our

attracted
by
the
brilliant

of
our

suddenly
daylight
appeared
in
the

the

slid
shut
the
magical
vision
disappeared
but
for
a
good
while
i
kept
dreaming
away
until
the
moment
my
eyes
focused
on
the

hanging
on
the
wall
the

showed

i
woke
up
only
after
a
long
twelvehour
slumber
conseil
a
creature
of
habit
came
to
ask
how
masters
night
went
and
to
offer
his
services
he
had
left
his
canadian
friend
sleeping
like
a
man
who
had
never
done
anything
else
i
let
the
gallant
lad
babble
as
he
pleased
without
giving
him
much
in
the
way
of
a
reply
i
was
concerned
about
captain
nemos
absence
during
our
session
the
previous
afternoon
and
i
hoped
to
see
him
again
today
soon
i
had
put
on
my
clothes
which
were
woven
from
strands
of
seashell
tissue
more
than
once
their
composition
provoked
comments
from
conseil
i
informed
him
that
they
were
made
from
the
smooth
silken
filaments
with
which
the
fan
mussel
a
type
of
seashell
quite
abundant
along
mediterranean
beaches
attaches
itself
to
rocks
in
olden
times
fine
fabrics
stockings
and
gloves
were
made
from
such
filaments
because
they
were
both
very
soft
and
very
warm
so
the
nautiluss
crew
could
dress
themselves
at
little
cost
without
needing
a
thing
from
cotton
growers
sheep
or
silkworms
on
shore
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
i
made
my
way
to
the
main
lounge
it
was
deserted
i
dove
into
studying
the
conchological
treasures
amassed
inside
the
glass
cases
i
also
investigated
the
huge
plant
albums
that
were
filled
with
the
rarest
marine
herbs
which
although
they
were
pressed
and
dried
still
kept
their
wonderful
colors
among
these
valuable
water
plants

squat
mushrooms
and
for
years
had
been
classified
among
the
zoophytes
in
short
a
complete
series
of
algae
the
entire
day
passed
without
my
being
honored
by
a
visit
from
captain
nemo
the
panels
in
the
lounge
didnt
open
perhaps
they
didnt
want
us
to
get
tired
of
these
beautiful
things
the
nautilus
kept
to
an
eastnortheasterly
heading

of
twelve
miles
per
hour
and

depth
between
fifty
and

meters

the
same
neglect
the
same
solitude
i
didnt
see
a
soul
from
the
crew
ned
and
conseil
spent
the
better
part
of
the
day
with
me
they
were
astonished
at
the
captains
inexplicable
absence
was
this
eccentric
man
ill
did
he
want
to
change
his
plans
concerning
us
but
after
all
as
conseil
noted
we
enjoyed
complete
freedom
we
were
daintily
and
abundantly
fed
our
host
had
kept
to
the
terms
of
his
agreement
we
couldnt
complain
and
moreover
the
very
uniqueness
of
our
situation
had
such
generous
rewards
in
store
for
us
we
had
no
grounds
for
criticism
that
day
i
started
my
diary
of
these
adventures
which
has
enabled
me
to
narrate
them
with
the
most
scrupulous
accuracy
and
one
odd
detail
i
wrote
it
on
paper
manufactured
from
marine
eelgrass
early
in
the
morning
on
november
11
fresh
air
poured
through
the
nautiluss
interior
informing
me
that
we
had
returned
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
to
renew
our
oxygen
supply
i
headed
for
the
central
companionway
and
climbed
onto
the
platform
it
was
six
oclock
i
found
the
weather
overcast
the
sea
gray
but
calm
hardly
a
billow
i
hoped
to
encounter
captain
nemo
therewould
he
come
i
saw
only
the
helmsman
imprisoned
in
his
glasswindowed
pilothouse
seated
on
the
ledge
furnished
by
the
hull
of
the
skiff
i
inhaled
the
seas
salty
aroma
with
great
pleasure
little
by
little
the
mists
were
dispersed
under
the
action
of
the
suns
rays
the
radiant
orb
cleared
the
eastern
horizon
under
its
gaze
the
sea
caught
on
fire
like
a
trail
of
gunpowder
scattered
on
high
the
clouds
were
colored
in
bright
wonderfully
shaded
hues
and
numerous
ladyfingers
warned
of
daylong
winds
authors
note
ladyfingers
are
small
thin
white
clouds
with
ragged
edges
but
what
were
mere
winds
to
this
nautilus
which
no
storms
could
intimidate
so
i
was
marveling
at
this
delightful
sunrise
so
lifegiving
and
cheerful
when
i
heard
someone
climbing
onto
the
platform
i
was
prepared
to
greet
captain
nemo
but
it
was
his
chief
officer
who
appearedwhom
i
had
already
met
during
our
first
visit
with
the
captain
he
advanced
over
the
platform
not
seeming
to
notice
my
presence
a
powerful
spyglass
to
his
eye
he
scrutinized
every
point
of
the
horizon
with
the
utmost
care
then
his
examination
over
he
approached
the
hatch
and
pronounced
a
phrase
whose
exact
wording
follows
below
i
remember
it
because
every
morning
it
was
repeated
under
the
same
circumstances
it
ran
like
this
nautron
respoc
lorni
virch
what
it
meant
i
was
unable
to
say
these
words
pronounced
the
chief
officer
went
below
again
i
thought
the
nautilus
was
about
to
resume
its
underwater
navigating
so
i
went
down
the
hatch
and
back
through
the
gangways
to
my
stateroom
five
days
passed
in
this
way
with
no
change
in
our
situation
every
morning
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
the
same
phrase
was
pronounced
by
the
same
individual
captain
nemo
did
not
appear
i
was
pursuing
the
policy
that
we
had
seen
the
last
of
him
when
on
november
16
while
reentering
my
stateroom
with
ned
and
conseil
i
found
a
note
addressed
to
me
on
the
table
i
opened
it
impatiently
it
was
written
in
a
script
that
was
clear
and
neat
but
a
bit
old
english
in
style
its
characters
reminding
me
of
german
calligraphy
the
note
was
worded
as
follows

he
hopes
nothing
will
prevent
the

from
attending
and
he
looks
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
professors
companions

does
this

went
on
that
seems
to
be
the
gist
of
it
i

the

on
solid
ground
well
figure
out
a
course
of
action
besides
it
wouldnt
pain
me
to
eat
a
couple
slices
of
fresh
venison
without
trying
to
reconcile
the
contradictions
between
captain
nemos
professed
horror
of
continents
or
islands
and
his
invitation
to
go
hunting
in
a
forest
i
was
content
to
reply
first
lets
look
into
this
crespo
island
i
consulted
the
world
map
and
in
latitude
32
degrees
40
north
and
longitude
167
degrees
50
west
i
found
an
islet
that
had
been
discovered
in
1801
by
captain
crespo
which
old
spanish
charts
called
rocca

in
other
words
silver
rock
so
we
were
about
1800
miles
from
our
starting
point
and
by
a
slight
change
of
heading
the
nautilus
was
bringing
us
back
toward
the
southeast
i
showed
my
companions
this
small
stray
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
north
pacific
if
captain
nemo
does
sometimes
go
ashore
i
told
them
at
least
he
only
picks
desert
islands
ned
land
shook
his
head
without
replying
then
he
and
conseil
left
me
after
supper
was
served
me
by
the
mute
and
emotionless
steward
i
fell
asleep
but
not
without
some
anxieties
when
i
woke
up
the
next
day
november
17
i
sensed
that
the
nautilus
was
completely
motionless
i
dressed
hurriedly
and
entered
the
main
lounge
captain
nemo
was
there
waiting
for
me
he
stood
up
bowed
and
asked
if
it
suited
me
to
come
along
since
he
made
no
allusion
to
his
absence
the
past
eight
days
i
also
refrained
from
mentioning
it
and
i
simply
answered
that
my
companions
and
i
were
ready
to
go
with
him
only
sir
i
added
ill
take
the
liberty
of
addressing
a
question
to
you
address
away
professor
aronnax
and
if
im
able
to
answer
i
will
well
then
captain
how
is
it
that
youve
severed
all
ties
with
the
shore
yet
you
own
forests
on
crespo
island
professor
the
captain
answered
me
these
forests
of
mine
dont
bask
in
the
heat
and
light
of
the
sun
they
arent
frequented
by
lions
tigers
panthers
or
other
quadrupeds
theyre
known
only
to
me
they
grow
only
for
me
these
forests
arent
on
land
theyre
actual
underwater
forests
underwater
forests
i
exclaimed
yes
professor
and
youre
offering
to
take
me
to
them
precisely
on
foot
without
getting
your
feet
wet
while
hunting
while
hunting
rifles
in
hand
rifles
in
hand
i
stared
at
the
nautiluss
commander
with
an
air
anything
but
flattering
to
the
man
assuredly
i
said
to
myself
hes
contracted
some
mental
illness
hes
had
a
fit
thats
lasted
eight
days
and
isnt
over
even
yet
what
a
shame
i
liked
him
better
eccentric
than
insane
these
thoughts
were
clearly
readable
on
my
face
but
captain
nemo
remained
content
with
inviting
me
to
follow
him
and
i
did
so
like
a
man
resigned
to
the
worst
we
arrived
at
the
dining
room
where
we
found
breakfast
served
professor
aronnax
the
captain
told
me
i
beg
you
to
share
my
breakfast
without
formality
we
can
chat
while
we
eat
because
although
i
promised
you
a
stroll
in
my
forests
i
made
no
pledge
to
arrange
for
your
encountering
a
restaurant
there
accordingly
eat
your
breakfast
like
a
man
wholl
probably
eat
dinner
only
when
its
extremely
late
i
did
justice
to
this
meal
it
was
made
up
of
various
fish
and
some
slices
of
sea
cucumber
that
praiseworthy
zoophyte
all
garnished
with
such
highly
appetizing
seaweed
as
the
porphyra
laciniata
and
the
laurencia
primafetida
our
beverage
consisted
of
clear
water
to
which
following
the
captains
example
i
added
some
drops
of
a
fermented
liquor
extracted
by
the
kamchatka
process
from
the
seaweed
known
by
name
as
rhodymenia
palmata
at
first
captain
nemo
ate
without
pronouncing
a
single
word
then
he
told
me
professor
when
i
proposed
that
you
go
hunting
in
my
crespo
forests
you
thought
i
was
contradicting
myself
when
i
informed
you
that
it
was
an
issue
of
underwater
forests
you
thought
id
gone
insane
professor
you
must
never
make
snap
judgments
about
your
fellow
man
but
captain
believe
me
kindly
listen
to
me
and
youll
see
if
you
have
grounds
for
accusing
me
of
insanity
or
selfcontradiction
im
all
attention
professor
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
a
man
can
live
underwater
so
long
as
he
carries
with
him
his
own
supply
of
breathable
air
for
underwater
work
projects
the
workman
wears
a
waterproof
suit
with
his
head
imprisoned
in
a
metal
capsule
while
he
receives
air
from
above
by
means
of
force
pumps
and
flow
regulators
thats
the
standard
equipment
for
a
diving
suit
i
said
correct
but
under
such
conditions
the
man
has
no
freedom
hes
attached
to
a
pump
that
sends
him
air
through
an
indiarubber
hose
its
an
actual
chain
that
fetters
him
to
the
shore
and
if
we
were
to
be
bound
in
this
way
to
the
nautilus
we
couldnt
go
far
either
then
how
do
you
break
free
i
asked
we
use
the
rouquayroldenayrouze
device
invented
by
two
of
your
fellow
countrymen
but
refined
by
me
for
my
own
special
uses
thereby
enabling
you
to
risk
these
new
physiological
conditions
without
suffering
any
organic
disorders
it
consists
of
a
tank
built
from
heavy
sheet
iron
in
which
i
store
air
under
a
pressure
of
fifty
atmospheres
this
tank
is
fastened
to
the
back
by
means
of
straps
like
a
soldiers
knapsack
its
top
part
forms
a
box
where
the
air
is
regulated
by
a
bellows
mechanism
and
can
be
released
only
at
its
proper
tension
in
the
rouquayrol
device
that
has
been
in
general
use
two
indiarubber
hoses
leave
this
box
and
feed
to
a
kind
of
tent
that
imprisons
the
operators
nose
and
mouth
one
hose
is
for
the
entrance
of
air
to
be
inhaled
the
other
for
the
exit
of
air
to
be
exhaled
and
the
tongue
closes
off
the
former
or
the
latter
depending
on
the
breathers
needs
but
in
my
case
since
i
face
considerable
pressures
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
i
needed
to
enclose
my
head
in
a
copper
sphere
like
those
found
on
standard
diving
suits
and
the
two
hoses
for
inhalation
and
exhalation
now
feed
to
that
sphere
thats
perfect
captain
nemo
but
the
air
you
carry
must
be
quickly
depleted
and
once
it
contains
no
more
than
15
oxygen
it
becomes
unfit
for
breathing
surely
but
as
i
told
you
professor
aronnax
the
nautiluss
pumps
enable
me
to
store
air
under
considerable
pressure
and
given
this
circumstance
the
tank
on
my
diving
equipment
can
supply
breathable
air
for
nine
or
ten
hours
ive
no
more
objections
to
raise
i
replied
ill
only
ask
you
captain
how
can
you
light
your
way
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
with
the
ruhmkorff
device
professor
aronnax
if
the
first
is
carried
on
the
back
the
second
is
fastened
to
the
belt
it
consists
of
a
bunsen
battery
that
i
activate
not
with
potassium
dichromate
but
with
sodium
an
induction
coil
gathers
the
electricity
generated
and
directs
it
to
a
specially
designed
lantern
in
this
lantern
one
finds
a
glass
spiral
that
contains
only
a
residue
of
carbon
dioxide
gas
when
the
device
is
operating
this
gas
becomes
luminous
and
gives
off
a
continuous
whitish
light
thus
provided
for
i
breathe
and
i
see
captain
nemo
to
my
every
objection
you
give
such
crushing
answers
im
afraid
to
entertain
a
single
doubt
however
though
i
have
no
choice
but
to
accept
both
the
rouquayrol
and
ruhmkorff
devices
id
like
to
register
some
reservations
about
the
rifle
with
which
youll
equip
me
but
it
isnt
a
rifle
that
uses
gunpowder
the
captain
replied
then
its
an
air
gun
surely
how
can
i
make
gunpowder
on
my
ship
when
i
have
no
saltpeter
sulfur
or
charcoal
even
so
i
replied
to
fire
underwater
in
a
medium
thats
855
times
denser
than
air
youd
have
to
overcome
considerable
resistance
that
doesnt
necessarily
follow
there
are
certain
fultonstyle
guns
perfected
by
the
englishmen
philippecoles
and
burley
the
frenchman
furcy
and
the
italian
landi
theyre
equipped
with
a
special
system
of
airtight
fastenings
and
can
fire
in
underwater
conditions
but
i
repeat
having
no
gunpowder
ive
replaced
it
with
air
at
high
pressure
which
is
abundantly
supplied
me
by
the
nautiluss
pumps
but
this
air
must
be
swiftly
depleted
well
in
a
pinch
cant
my
rouquayrol
tank
supply
me
with
more
all
i
have
to
do
is
draw
it
from
an
ad
hoc
spigot
besides
professor
aronnax
youll
see
for
yourself
that
during
these
underwater
hunting
trips
we
make
no
great
expenditure
of
either
air
or
bullets
latin
a
spigot
just
for
that
purpose
ed
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
semidarkness
amid
this
liquid
thats
so
dense
in
comparison
to
the
atmosphere
a
gunshot
couldnt
carry
far
and
would
prove
fatal
only
with
difficulty
on
the
contrary
sir
with
this
rifle
every
shot
is
fatal
and
as
soon
as
the
animal
is
hit
no
matter
how
lightly
it
falls
as
if
struck
by
lightning
why
because
this
rifle
doesnt
shoot
ordinary
bullets
but
little
glass
capsules
invented
by
the
austrian
chemist
leniebroek
and
i
have
a
considerable
supply
of
them
these
glass
capsules
are
covered
with
a
strip
of
steel
and
weighted
with
a
lead
base
theyre
genuine
little
leyden
jars
charged
with
highvoltage
electricity
they
go
off
at
the
slightest
impact
and
the
animal
no
matter
how
strong
drops
dead
i
might
add
that
these
capsules
are
no
bigger
than
number
4
shot
and
the
chamber
of
any
ordinary
rifle
could
hold
ten
of
them
ill
quit
debating
i
replied
getting
up
from
the
table
and
all
thats
left
is
for
me
to
shoulder
my
rifle
so
where
you
go
ill
go
captain
nemo
led
me
to
the
nautiluss
stern
and
passing
by
ned
and
conseils
cabin
i
summoned
my
two
companions
who
instantly
followed
us
then
we
arrived
at
a
cell
located
within
easy
access
of
the
engine
room
in
this
cell
we
were
to
get
dressed
for
our
stroll
chapter
16
strolling
the
plains
this
cell
properly
speaking
was
the
nautiluss
arsenal
and
wardrobe
hanging
from
its
walls
a
dozen
diving
outfits
were
waiting
for
anybody
who
wanted
to
take
a
stroll
after
seeing
these
ned
land
exhibited
an
obvious
distaste
for
the
idea
of
putting
one
on
but
my
gallant
ned
i
told
him
the
forests
of
crespo
island
are
simply
underwater
forests
oh
great
put
in
the
disappointed
harpooner
watching
his
dreams
of
fresh
meat
fade
away
and
you
professor
aronnax
are
you
going
to
stick
yourself
inside
these
clothes
it
has
to
be
mr
ned
have
it
your
way
sir
the
harpooner
replied
shrugging
his
shoulders
but
speaking
for
myself
ill
never
get
into
those
things
unless
they
force
me
no
one
will
force
you
mr
land
captain
nemo
said
and
is
conseil
going
to
risk
it
ned
asked
where
master
goes
i
go
conseil
replied
at
the
captains
summons
two
crewmen
came
to
help
us
put
on
these
heavy
waterproof
clothes
made
from
seamless
india
rubber
and
expressly
designed
to
bear
considerable
pressures
they
were
like
suits
of
armor
that
were
both
yielding
and
resistant
you
might
say
these
clothes
consisted
of
jacket
and
pants
the
pants
ended
in
bulky
footwear
adorned
with
heavy
lead
soles
the
fabric
of
the
jacket
was
reinforced
with
copper
mail
that
shielded
the
chest
protected
it
from
the
waters
pressure
and
allowed
the
lungs
to
function
freely
the
sleeves
ended
in
supple
gloves
that
didnt
impede
hand
movements
these
perfected
diving
suits
it
was
easy
to
see
were
a
far
cry
from
such
misshapen
costumes
as
the
cork
breastplates
leather
jumpers
seagoing
tunics
barrel
helmets
etc
invented
and
acclaimed
in
the
18th
century
conseil
and
i
were
soon
dressed
in
these
diving
suits
as
were
captain
nemo
and
one
of
his
companionsa
herculean
type
who
must
have
been
prodigiously
strong
all
that
remained
was
to
encase
ones
head
in
its
metal
sphere
but
before
proceeding
with
this
operation
i
asked
the
captain
for
permission
to
examine
the
rifles
set
aside
for
us
one
of
the
nautiluss
men
presented
me
with
a
streamlined
rifle
whose
butt
was
boilerplate
steel
hollow
inside
and
of
fairly
large
dimensions
this
served
as
a
tank
for
the
compressed
air
which
a
triggeroperated
valve
could
release
into
the
metal
chamber
in
a
groove
where
the
butt
was
heaviest
a
cartridge
clip
held
some
twenty
electric
bullets
that
by
means
of
a
spring
automatically
took
their
places
in
the
barrel
of
the
rifle
as
soon
as
one
shot
had
been
fired
another
was
ready
to

i
said
this
is
an
ideal
easytouse
weapon
i
ask
only
to
put
it
to
the
test
but
how
will
we
reach
the
bottom
of
the
sea
right
now
professor
the
nautilus
is
aground
in
ten
meters
of
water
and
weve
only
to
depart
but
how
will
we
set
out
youll
see
captain
nemo
inserted
his
cranium
into
its
spherical
headgear
conseil
and
i
did
the
same
but
not
without
hearing
the
canadian
toss
us
a
sarcastic
happy
hunting
on
top
the
suit
ended
in
a
collar
of
threaded
copper
onto
which
the
metal
helmet
was
screwed
three
holes
protected
by
heavy
glass
allowed
us
to
see
in
any
direction
with
simply
a
turn
of
the
head
inside
the
sphere
placed
on
our
backs
the
rouquayrol
device
went
into
operation
as
soon
as
it
was
in
position
and
for
my
part
i
could
breathe
with
ease
the
ruhmkorff
lamp
hanging
from
my
belt
my
rifle
in
hand
i
was
ready
to
go
forth
but
in
all
honesty
while
imprisoned
in
these
heavy
clothes
and
nailed
to
the
deck
by
my
lead
soles
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
take
a
single
step
but
this
circumstance
had
been
foreseen
because
i
felt
myself
propelled
into
a
little
room
adjoining
the
wardrobe
towed
in
the
same
way
my
companions
went
with
me
i
heard
a
door
with
watertight
seals
close
after
us
and
we
were
surrounded
by
profound
darkness
after
some
minutes
a
sharp
hissing
reached
my
ears
i
felt
a
distinct
sensation
of
cold
rising
from
my
feet
to
my
chest
apparently
a
stopcock
inside
the
boat
was
letting
in
water
from
outside
which
overran
us
and
soon
filled
up
the
room
contrived
in
the
nautiluss
side
a
second
door
then
opened
we
were
lit
by
a
subdued
light
an
instant
later
our
feet
were
treading
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
now
how
can
i
convey
the
impressions
left
on
me
by
this
stroll
under
the
waters
words
are
powerless
to
describe
such
wonders
when
even
the
painters
brush
cant
depict
the
effects
unique
to
the
liquid
element
how
can
the
writers
pen
hope
to
reproduce
them
captain
nemo
walked
in
front
and
his
companion
followed
us
a
few
steps
to
the
rear
conseil
and
i
stayed
next
to
each
other
as
if
daydreaming
that
through
our
metal
carapaces
a
little
polite
conversation
might
still
be
possible
already
i
no
longer
felt
the
bulkiness
of
my
clothes
footwear
and
air
tank
nor
the
weight
of
the
heavy
sphere
inside
which
my
head
was
rattling
like
an
almond
in
its
shell
once
immersed
in
water
all
these
objects
lost
a
part
of
their
weight
equal
to
the
weight
of
the
liquid
they
displaced
and
thanks
to
this
law
of
physics
discovered
by
archimedes
i
did
just
fine
i
was
no
longer
an
inert
mass
and
i
had
comparatively
speaking
great
freedom
of
movement
lighting
up
the
seafloor
even
thirty
feet
beneath
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
sun
astonished
me
with
its
power
the
solar
rays
easily
crossed
this
aqueous
mass
and
dispersed
its
dark
colors
i
could
easily
distinguish
objects
100
meters
away
farther
on
the
bottom
was
tinted
with
fine
shades
of
ultramarine
then
off
in
the
distance
it
turned
blue
and
faded
in
the
midst
of
a
hazy
darkness
truly
this
water
surrounding
me
was
just
a
kind
of
air
denser
than
the
atmosphere
on
land
but
almost
as
transparent
above
me
i
could
see
the
calm
surface
of
the
ocean
we
were
walking
on
sand
that
was
finegrained
and
smooth
not
wrinkled
like
beach
sand
which
preserves
the
impressions
left
by
the
waves
this
dazzling
carpet
was
a
real
mirror
throwing
back
the
suns
rays
with
startling
intensity
the
outcome
an
immense
vista
of
reflections
that
penetrated
every
liquid
molecule
will
anyone
believe
me
if
i
assert
that
at
this
thirtyfoot
depth
i
could
see
as
if
it
was
broad
daylight
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
trod
this
blazing
sand
which
was
strewn
with
tiny
crumbs
of
seashell
looming
like
a
long
reef
the
nautiluss
hull
disappeared
little
by
little
but
when
night
fell
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
the
ships
beacon
would
surely
facilitate
our
return
on
board
since
its
rays
carried
with
perfect
distinctness
this
effect
is
difficult
to
understand
for
anyone
who
has
never
seen
light
beams
so
sharply
defined
on
shore
there
the
dust
that
saturates
the
air
gives
such
rays
the
appearance
of
a
luminous
fog
but
above
water
as
well
as
underwater
shafts
of
electric
light
are
transmitted
with
incomparable
clarity
meanwhile
we
went
ever
onward
and
these
vast
plains
of
sand
seemed
endless
my
hands
parted
liquid
curtains
that
closed
again
behind
me
and
my
footprints
faded
swiftly
under
the
waters
pressure
soon
scarcely
blurred
by
their
distance
from
us
the
forms
of
some
objects
took
shape
before
my
eyes
i
recognized
the
lower
slopes
of
some
magnificent
rocks
carpeted
by
the
finest
zoophyte
specimens
and
right
off
i
was
struck
by
an
effect
unique
to
this
medium
by
then
it
was
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
the
suns
rays
hit
the
surface
of
the
waves
at
a
fairly
oblique
angle
decomposing
by
refraction
as
though
passing
through
a
prism
and
when
this
light
came
in
contact
with
flowers
rocks
buds
seashells
and
polyps
the
edges
of
these
objects
were
shaded
with
all
seven
hues
of
the
solar
spectrum
this
riot
of
rainbow
tints
was
a
wonder
a
feast
for
the
eyes
a
genuine
kaleidoscope
of
red
green
yellow
orange
violet
indigo
and
blue
in
short
the
whole
palette
of
a
colorhappy
painter
if
only
i
had
been
able
to
share
with
conseil
the
intense
sensations
rising
in
my
brain
competing
with
him
in
exclamations
of
wonderment
if
only
i
had
known
like
captain
nemo
and
his
companion
how
to
exchange
thoughts
by
means
of
prearranged
signals
so
for
lack
of
anything
better
i
talked
to
myself
i
declaimed
inside
this
copper
box
that
topped
my
head
spending
more
air
on
empty
words
than
was
perhaps
advisable
conseil
like
me
had
stopped
before
this
splendid
sight
obviously
in
the
presence
of
these
zoophyte
and
mollusk
specimens
the
fine
lad
was
classifying
his
head
off
polyps
and
echinoderms

on

holding

adorned
by

from
the
genus
porpita
wearing
collars
of
azure
tentacles
and
starfish
that
spangled
the
sand
including
veinlike
feather
stars
from
the
genus
asterophyton
that
were
like
fine
lace
embroidered
by
the
hands
of
water
nymphs
their
festoons
swaying
to
the
faint
undulations
caused
by
our
walking
it
filled
me
with
real
chagrin
to
crush
underfoot
the
gleaming

that
littered
the
seafloor

and
so
many
other
exhibits
from
this
inexhaustible
ocean
but
we
had
to
keep
walking
and
we
went
forward
while
overhead
there
scudded
schools
of
portuguese
menofwar
that
let
their
ultramarine
tentacles
drift
in
their
wakes
medusas
whose
milky
white
or
dainty
pink
parasols
were
festooned
with
azure
tassels
and
shaded
us
from
the
suns
rays
plus
jellyfish
of
the
species
pelagia
panopyra
that
in
the
dark
would
have
strewn
our
path
with
phosphorescent
glimmers
all
these
wonders
i
glimpsed
in
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
barely
pausing
following
captain
nemo
whose
gestures
kept
beckoning
me
onward
soon
the
nature
of
the
seafloor
changed
the
plains
of
sand
were
followed
by
a
bed
of
that
viscous
slime
americans
call
ooze
which
is
composed
exclusively
of
seashells
rich
in
limestone
or
silica
then
we
crossed
a
prairie
of
algae
opensea
plants
that
the
waters
hadnt
yet
torn
loose
whose
vegetation
grew
in
wild
profusion
soft
to
the
foot
these
densely
textured
lawns
would
have
rivaled
the
most
luxuriant
carpets
woven
by
the
hand
of
man
but
while
this
greenery
was
sprawling
under
our
steps
it
didnt
neglect
us
overhead
the
surface
of
the
water
was
crisscrossed
by
a
floating
arbor
of
marine
plants
belonging
to
that
superabundant
algae
family
that
numbers
more
than
2000
known
species
i
saw
long
ribbons
of
fucus
drifting
above
me
some
globular
others
tubular
laurencia
cladostephus
with
the
slenderest
foliage
rhodymenia
palmata
resembling
the
fan
shapes
of
cactus
i
observed
that
greencolored
plants
kept
closer
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
while
reds
occupied
a
medium
depth
which
left
blacks
and
browns
in
charge
of
designing
gardens
and
flowerbeds
in
the
oceans
lower
strata
these
algae
are
a
genuine
prodigy
of
creation
one
of
the
wonders
of
world
flora
this
family
produces
both
the
biggest
and
smallest
vegetables
in
the
world
because
just
as
40000
nearinvisible
buds
have
been
counted
in
one
fivesquaremillimeter
space
so
also
have
fucus
plants
been
gathered
that
were
over
500
meters
long
we
had
been
gone
from
the
nautilus
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
it
was
almost
noon
i
spotted
this
fact
in
the
perpendicularity
of
the
suns
rays
which
were
no
longer
refracted
the
magic
of
these
solar
colors
disappeared
little
by
little
with
emerald
and
sapphire
shades
vanishing
from
our
surroundings
altogether
we
walked
with
steady
steps
that
rang
on
the
seafloor
with
astonishing
intensity
the
tiniest
sounds
were
transmitted
with
a
speed
to
which
the
ear
is
unaccustomed
on
shore
in
fact
water
is
a
better
conductor
of
sound
than
air
and
under
the
waves
noises
carry
four
times
as
fast
just
then
the
seafloor
began
to
slope
sharply
downward
the
light
took
on
a
uniform
hue
we
reached
a
depth
of
100
meters
by
which
point
we
were
undergoing
a
pressure
of
ten
atmospheres
but
my
diving
clothes
were
built
along
such
lines
that
i
never
suffered
from
this
pressure
i
felt
only
a
certain
tightness
in
the
joints
of
my
fingers
and
even
this
discomfort
soon
disappeared
as
for
the
exhaustion
bound
to
accompany
a
twohour
stroll
in
such
unfamiliar
trappingsit
was
nil
helped
by
the
water
my
movements
were
executed
with
startling
ease
arriving
at
this
300foot
depth
i
still
detected
the
suns
rays
but
just
barely
their
intense
brilliance
had
been
followed
by
a
reddish
twilight
a
midpoint
between
day
and
night
but
we
could
see
well
enough
to
find
our
way
and
it
still
wasnt
necessary
to
activate
the
ruhmkorff
device
just
then
captain
nemo
stopped
he
waited
until
i
joined
him
then
he
pointed
a
finger
at
some
dark
masses
outlined
in
the
shadows
a
short
distance
away
its
the
forest
of
crespo
island
i
thought
and
i
was
not
mistaken
chapter
17
an
underwater
forest
we
had
finally
arrived
on
the
outskirts
of
this
forest
surely
one
of
the
finest
in
captain
nemos
immense
domains
he
regarded
it
as
his
own
and
had
laid
the
same
claim
to
it
that
in
the
first
days
of
the
world
the
first
men
had
to
their
forests
on
land
besides
who
else
could
dispute
his
ownership
of
this
underwater
property
what
other
bolder
pioneer
would
come
ax
in
hand
to
clear
away
its
dark
underbrush
this
forest
was
made
up
of
big
treelike
plants
and
when
we
entered
beneath
their
huge
arches
my
eyes
were
instantly
struck
by
the
unique
arrangement
of
their
branchesan
arrangement
that
i
had
never
before
encountered
none
of
the
weeds
carpeting
the
seafloor
none
of
the
branches
bristling
from
the
shrubbery
crept
or
leaned
or
stretched
on
a
horizontal
plane
they
all
rose
right
up
toward
the
surface
of
the
ocean
every
filament
or
ribbon
no
matter
how
thin
stood
ramrod
straight
fucus
plants
and
creepers
were
growing
in
stiff
perpendicular
lines
governed
by
the
density
of
the
element
that
generated
them
after
i
parted
them
with
my
hands
these
otherwise
motionless
plants
would
shoot
right
back
to
their
original
positions
it
was
the
regime
of
verticality
i
soon
grew
accustomed
to
this
bizarre
arrangement
likewise
to
the
comparative
darkness
surrounding
us
the
seafloor
in
this
forest
was
strewn
with
sharp
chunks
of
stone
that
were
hard
to
avoid
here
the
range
of
underwater
flora
seemed
pretty
comprehensive
to
me
as
well
as
more
abundant
than
it
might
have
been
in
the
arctic
or
tropical
zones
where
such
exhibits
are
less
common
but
for
a
few
minutes
i
kept
accidentally
confusing
the
two
kingdoms
mistaking
zoophytes
for
water
plants
animals
for
vegetables
and
who
hasnt
made
the
same
blunder
flora
and
fauna
are
so
closely
associated
in
the
underwater
world
i
observed
that
all
these
exhibits
from
the
vegetable
kingdom
were
attached
to
the
seafloor
by
only
the
most
makeshift
methods
they
had
no
roots
and
didnt
care
which
solid
objects
secured
them
sand
shells
husks
or
pebbles
they
didnt
ask
their
hosts
for
sustenance
just
a
point
of
purchase
these
plants
are
entirely
selfpropagating
and
the
principle
of
their
existence
lies
in
the
water
that
sustains
and
nourishes
them
in
place
of
leaves
most
of
them
sprouted
blades
of
unpredictable
shape
which
were
confined
to
a
narrow
gamut
of
colors
consisting
only
of
pink
crimson
green
olive
tan
and
brown
there
i
saw
again
but
not
yet
pressed
and
dried
like
the
nautiluss
specimens
some
peacocks
tails
spread
open
like
fans
to
stir
up
a
cooling
breeze
scarlet
rosetangle
sea
tangle
stretching
out
their
young
and
edible
shoots
twisting
strings
of
kelp
from
the
genus
nereocystis
that
bloomed
to
a
height
of
fifteen
meters
bouquets
of
mermaids
cups
whose
stems
grew
wider
at
the
top
and
a
number
of
other
opensea
plants
all
without
flowers
its
an
odd
anomaly
in
this
bizarre
element
as
one
witty
naturalist
puts
it
the
animal
kingdom
blossoms
and
the
vegetable
kingdom
doesnt
these
various
types
of
shrubbery
were
as
big
as
trees
in
the
temperate
zones
in
the
damp
shade
between
them
there
were
clustered
actual
bushes
of
moving
flowers
hedges
of
zoophytes
in
which
there
grew
stony
coral
striped
with
twisting
furrows
yellowish
sea
anemone
from
the
genus
caryophylia
with
translucent
tentacles
plus
anemone
with
grassy
tufts
from
the
genus
zoantharia
and
to
complete
the
illusion
minnows
flitted
from
branch
to
branch
like
a
swarm
of
hummingbirds
while
there
rose
underfoot
like
a
covey
of
snipe
yellow
fish
from
the
genus
lepisocanthus
with
bristling
jaws
and
sharp
scales
flying
gurnards
and
pinecone
fish
near
one
oclock
captain
nemo
gave
the
signal
to
halt
speaking
for
myself
i
was
glad
to
oblige
and
we
stretched
out
beneath
an
arbor
of
winged
kelp
whose
long
thin
tendrils
stood
up
like
arrows
this
short
break
was
a
delight
it
lacked
only
the
charm
of
conversation
but
it
was
impossible
to
speak
impossible
to
reply
i
simply
nudged
my
big
copper
headpiece
against
conseils
headpiece
i
saw
a
happy
gleam
in
the
gallant
lads
eyes
and
to
communicate
his
pleasure
he
jiggled
around
inside
his
carapace
in
the
worlds
silliest
way
after
four
hours
of
strolling
i
was
quite
astonished
not
to
feel
any
intense
hunger
what
kept
my
stomach
in
such
a
good
mood
im
unable
to
say
but
in
exchange
i
experienced
that
irresistible
desire
for
sleep
that
comes
over
every
diver
accordingly
my
eyes
soon
closed
behind
their
heavy
glass
windows
and
i
fell
into
an
uncontrollable
doze
which
until
then
i
had
been
able
to
fight
off
only
through
the
movements
of
our
walking
captain
nemo
and
his
muscular
companion
were
already
stretched
out
in
this
clear
crystal
setting
us
a
fine
naptime
example
how
long
i
was
sunk
in
this
torpor
i
cannot
estimate
but
when
i
awoke
it
seemed
as
if
the
sun
were
settling
toward
the
horizon
captain
nemo
was
already
up
and
i
had
started
to
stretch
my
limbs
when
an
unexpected
apparition
brought
me
sharply
to
my
feet
a
few
paces
away
a
monstrous
meterhigh
sea
spider
was
staring
at
me
with
beady
eyes
poised
to
spring
at
me
although
my
diving
suit
was
heavy
enough
to
protect
me
from
this
animals
bites
i
couldnt
keep
back
a
shudder
of
horror
just
then
conseil
woke
up
together
with
the
nautiluss
sailor
captain
nemo
alerted
his
companion
to
this
hideous
crustacean
which
a
swing
of
the
rifle
butt
quickly
brought
down
and
i
watched
the
monsters
horrible
legs
writhing
in
dreadful
convulsions
this
encounter
reminded
me
that
other
more
daunting
animals
must
be
lurking
in
these
dark
reaches
and
my
diving
suit
might
not
be
adequate
protection
against
their
attacks
such
thoughts
hadnt
previously
crossed
my
mind
and
i
was
determined
to
keep
on
my
guard
meanwhile
i
had
assumed
this
rest
period
would
be
the
turning
point
in
our
stroll
but
i
was
mistaken
and
instead
of
heading
back
to
the
nautilus
captain
nemo
continued
his
daring
excursion
the
seafloor
kept
sinking
and
its
significantly
steeper
slope
took
us
to
greater
depths
it
must
have
been
nearly
three
oclock
when
we
reached
a
narrow
valley
gouged
between
high
vertical
walls
and
located
150
meters
down
thanks
to
the
perfection
of
our
equipment
we
had
thus
gone
ninety
meters
below
the
limit
that
nature
had
until
then
set
on
mans
underwater
excursions
i
say
150
meters
although
i
had
no
instruments
for
estimating
this
distance
but
i
knew
that
the
suns
rays
even
in
the
clearest
seas
could
reach
no
deeper
so
at
precisely
this
point
the
darkness
became
profound
not
a
single
object
was
visible
past
ten
paces
consequently
i
had
begun
to
grope
my
way
when
suddenly
i
saw
the
glow
of
an
intense
white
light
captain
nemo
had
just
activated
his
electric
device
his
companion
did
likewise
conseil
and
i
followed
suit
by
turning
a
switch
i
established
contact
between
the
induction
coil
and
the
glass
spiral
and
the
sea
lit
up
by
our
four
lanterns
was
illuminated
for
a
radius
of
twentyfive
meters
captain
nemo
continued
to
plummet
into
the
dark
depths
of
this
forest
whose
shrubbery
grew
ever
more
sparse
i
observed
that
vegetable
life
was
disappearing
more
quickly
than
animal
life
the
opensea
plants
had
already
left
behind
the
increasingly
arid
seafloor
where
a
prodigious
number
of
animals
were
still
swarming
zoophytes
articulates
mollusks
and
fish
while
we
were
walking
i
thought
the
lights
of
our
ruhmkorff
devices
would
automatically
attract
some
inhabitants
of
these
dark
strata
but
if
they
did
approach
us
at
least
they
kept
at
a
distance
regrettable
from
the
hunters
standpoint
several
times
i
saw
captain
nemo
stop
and
take
aim
with
his
rifle
then
after
sighting
down
its
barrel
for
a
few
seconds
he
would
straighten
up
and
resume
his
walk
finally
at
around
four
oclock
this
marvelous
excursion
came
to
an
end
a
wall
of
superb
rocks
stood
before
us
imposing
in
its
sheer
mass
a
pile
of
gigantic
stone
blocks
an
enormous
granite
cliffside
pitted
with
dark
caves
but
not
offering
a
single
gradient
we
could
climb
up
this
was
the
underpinning
of
crespo
island
this
was
land
the
captain
stopped
suddenly
a
gesture
from
him
brought
us
to
a
halt
and
however
much
i
wanted
to
clear
this
wall
i
had
to
stop
here
ended
the
domains
of
captain
nemo
he
had
no
desire
to
pass
beyond
them
farther
on
lay
a
part
of
the
globe
he
would
no
longer
tread
underfoot
our
return
journey
began
captain
nemo
resumed
the
lead
in
our
little
band
always
heading
forward
without
hesitation
i
noted
that
we
didnt
follow
the
same
path
in
returning
to
the
nautilus
this
new
route
very
steep
and
hence
very
arduous
quickly
took
us
close
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
but
this
return
to
the
upper
strata
wasnt
so
sudden
that
decompression
took
place
too
quickly
which
could
have
led
to
serious
organic
disorders
and
given
us
those
internal
injuries
so
fatal
to
divers
with
great
promptness
the
light
reappeared
and
grew
stronger
and
the
refraction
of
the
sun
already
low
on
the
horizon
again
ringed
the
edges
of
various
objects
with
the
entire
color
spectrum
at
a
depth
of
ten
meters
we
walked
amid
a
swarm
of
small
fish
from
every
species
more
numerous
than
birds
in
the
air
more
agile
too
but
no
aquatic
game
worthy
of
a
gunshot
had
yet
been
offered
to
our
eyes
just
then
i
saw
the
captains
weapon
spring
to
his
shoulder
and
track
a
moving
object
through
the
bushes
a
shot
went
off
i
heard
a
faint
hissing
and
an
animal
dropped
a
few
paces
away
literally
struck
by
lightning
it
was
a
magnificent
sea
otter
from
the
genus
enhydra
the
only
exclusively
marine
quadruped
one
and
a
half
meters
long
this
otter
had
to
be
worth
a
good
high
price
its
coat
chestnut
brown
above
and
silver
below
would
have
made
one
of
those
wonderful
fur
pieces
so
much
in
demand
in
the
russian
and
chinese
markets
the
fineness
and
luster
of
its
pelt
guaranteed
that
it
would
go
for
at
least
2000
francs
i
was
full
of
wonderment
at
this
unusual
mammal
with
its
circular
head
adorned
by
short
ears
its
round
eyes
its
white
whiskers
like
those
on
a
cat
its
webbed
and
clawed
feet
its
bushy
tail
hunted
and
trapped
by
fishermen
this
valuable
carnivore
has
become
extremely
rare
and
it
takes
refuge
chiefly
in
the
northernmost
parts
of
the
pacific
where
in
all
likelihood
its
species
will
soon
be
facing
extinction
captain
nemos
companion
picked
up
the
animal
loaded
it
on
his
shoulder
and
we
took
to
the
trail
again
for
an
hour
plains
of
sand
unrolled
before
our
steps
often
the
seafloor
rose
to
within
two
meters
of
the
surface
of
the
water
i
could
then
see
our
images
clearly
mirrored
on
the
underside
of
the
waves
but
reflected
upside
down
above
us
there
appeared
an
identical
band
that
duplicated
our
every
movement
and
gesture
in
short
a
perfect
likeness
of
the
quartet
near
which
it
walked
but
with
heads
down
and
feet
in
the
air
another
unusual
effect
heavy
clouds
passed
above
us
forming
and
fading
swiftly
but
after
thinking
it
over
i
realized
that
these
socalled
clouds
were
caused
simply
by
the
changing
densities
of
the
long
ground
swells
and
i
even
spotted
the
foaming
white
caps
that
their
breaking
crests
were
proliferating
over
the
surface
of
the
water
lastly
i
couldnt
help
seeing
the
actual
shadows
of
large
birds
passing
over
our
heads
swiftly
skimming
the
surface
of
the
sea
on
this
occasion
i
witnessed
one
of
the
finest
gunshots
ever
to
thrill
the
marrow
of
a
hunter
a
large
bird
with
a
wide
wingspan
quite
clearly
visible
approached
and
hovered
over
us
when
it
was
just
a
few
meters
above
the
waves
captain
nemos
companion
took
aim
and
fired
the
animal
dropped
electrocuted
and
its
descent
brought
it
within
reach
of
our
adroit
hunter
who
promptly
took
possession
of
it
it
was
an
albatross
of
the
finest
species
a
wonderful
specimen
of
these
opensea
fowl
this
incident
did
not
interrupt
our
walk
for
two
hours
we
were
sometimes
led
over
plains
of
sand
sometimes
over
prairies
of
seaweed
that
were
quite
arduous
to
cross
in
all
honesty
i
was
dead
tired
by
the
time
i
spotted
a
hazy
glow
half
a
mile
away
cutting
through
the
darkness
of
the
waters
it
was
the
nautiluss
beacon
within
twenty
minutes
we
would
be
on
board
and
there
i
could
breathe
easy
againbecause
my
tanks
current
air
supply
seemed
to
be
quite
low
in
oxygen
but
i
was
reckoning
without
an
encounter
that
slightly
delayed
our
arrival
i
was
lagging
behind
some
twenty
paces
when
i
saw
captain
nemo
suddenly
come
back
toward
me
with
his
powerful
hands
he
sent
me
buckling
to
the
ground
while
his
companion
did
the
same
to
conseil
at
first
i
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
this
sudden
assault
but
i
was
reassured
to
observe
the
captain
lying
motionless
beside
me
i
was
stretched
out
on
the
seafloor
directly
beneath
some
bushes
of
algae
when
i
raised
my
head
and
spied
two
enormous
masses
hurtling
by
throwing
off
phosphorescent
glimmers
my
blood
turned
cold
in
my
veins
i
saw
that
we
were
under
threat
from
a
fearsome
pair
of
sharks
they
were
blue
sharks
dreadful
maneaters
with
enormous
tails
dull
glassy
stares
and
phosphorescent
matter
oozing
from
holes
around
their
snouts
they
were
like
monstrous
fireflies
that
could
thoroughly
pulverize
a
man
in
their
iron
jaws
i
dont
know
if
conseil
was
busy
with
their
classification
but
as
for
me
i
looked
at
their
silver
bellies
their
fearsome
mouths
bristling
with
teeth
from
a
viewpoint
less
than
scientificmore
as
a
victim
than
as
a
professor
of
natural
history
luckily
these
voracious
animals
have
poor
eyesight
they
went
by
without
noticing
us
grazing
us
with
their
brownish
fins
and
miraculously
we
escaped
a
danger
greater
than
encountering
a
tiger
deep
in
the
jungle
half
an
hour
later
guided
by
its
electric
trail
we
reached
the
nautilus
the
outside
door
had
been
left
open
and
captain
nemo
closed
it
after
we
reentered
the
first
cell
then
he
pressed
a
button
i
heard
pumps
operating
within
the
ship
i
felt
the
water
lowering
around
me
and
in
a
few
moments
the
cell
was
completely
empty
the
inside
door
opened
and
we
passed
into
the
wardrobe
there
our
diving
suits
were
removed
not
without
difficulty
and
utterly
exhausted
faint
from
lack
of
food
and
rest
i
repaired
to
my
stateroom
full
of
wonder
at
this
startling
excursion
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
chapter
18
four
thousand
leagues
under
the
pacific
by
the
next
morning
november
18
i
was
fully
recovered
from
my
exhaustion
of
the
day
before
and
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
just
as
the
nautiluss
chief
officer
was
pronouncing
his
daily
phrase
it
then
occurred
to
me
that
these
words
either
referred
to
the
state
of
the
sea
or
that
they
meant
theres
nothing
in
sight
and
in
truth
the
ocean
was
deserted
not
a
sail
on
the
horizon
the
tips
of
crespo
island
had
disappeared
during
the
night
the
sea
absorbing
every
color
of
the
prism
except
its
blue
rays
reflected
the
latter
in
every
direction
and
sported
a
wonderful
indigo
tint
the
undulating
waves
regularly
took
on
the
appearance
of
watered
silk
with
wide
stripes
i
was
marveling
at
this
magnificent
ocean
view
when
captain
nemo
appeared
he
didnt
seem
to
notice
my
presence
and
began
a
series
of
astronomical
observations
then
his
operations
finished
he
went
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
beacon
housing
his
eyes
straying
over
the
surface
of
the
ocean
meanwhile
some
twenty
of
the
nautiluss
sailorsall
energetic
wellbuilt
fellowsclimbed
onto
the
platform
they
had
come
to
pull
up
the
nets
left
in
our
wake
during
the
night
these
seamen
obviously
belonged
to
different
nationalities
although
indications
of
european
physical
traits
could
be
seen
in
them
all
if
im
not
mistaken
i
recognized
some
irishmen
some
frenchmen
a
few
slavs
and
a
native
of
either
greece
or
crete
even
so
these
men
were
frugal
of
speech
and
used
among
themselves
only
that
bizarre
dialect
whose
origin
i
couldnt
even
guess
so
i
had
to
give
up
any
notions
of
questioning
them
the
nets
were
hauled
on
board
they
were
a
breed
of
trawl
resembling
those
used
off
the
normandy
coast
huge
pouches
held
half
open
by
a
floating
pole
and
a
chain
laced
through
the
lower
meshes
trailing
in
this
way
from
these
iron
glove
makers
the
resulting
receptacles
scoured
the
ocean
floor
and
collected
every
marine
exhibit
in
their
path
that
day
they
gathered
up
some
unusual
specimens
from
these
fishfilled
waterways
anglerfish
whose
comical
movements
qualify
them
for
the
epithet
clowns
black
commerson
anglers
equipped
with
their
antennas
undulating
triggerfish
encircled
by
little
red
bands
bloated
puffers
whose
venom
is
extremely
insidious
some
olivehued
lampreys
snipefish
covered
with
silver
scales
cutlass
fish
whose
electrocuting
power
equals
that
of
the
electric
eel
and
the
electric
ray
scaly
featherbacks
with
brown
crosswise
bands
greenish
codfish
several
varieties
of
goby
etc
finally
some
fish
of
larger
proportions
a
onemeter
jack
with
a
prominent
head
several
fine
bonito
from
the
genus
scomber
decked
out
in
the
colors
blue
and
silver
and
three
magnificent
tuna
whose
high
speeds
couldnt
save
them
from
our
trawl
i
estimate
that
this
cast
of
the
net
brought
in
more
than
1000
pounds
of
fish
it
was
a
fine
catch
but
not
surprising
in
essence
these
nets
stayed
in
our
wake
for
several
hours
incarcerating
an
entire
aquatic
world
in
prisons
made
of
thread
so
we
were
never
lacking
in
provisions
of
the
highest
quality
which
the
nautiluss
speed
and
the
allure
of
its
electric
light
could
continually
replenish
these
various
exhibits
from
the
sea
were
immediately
lowered
down
the
hatch
in
the
direction
of
the
storage
lockers
some
to
be
eaten
fresh
others
to
be
preserved
after
its
fishing
was
finished
and
its
air
supply
renewed
i
thought
the
nautilus
would
resume
its
underwater
excursion
and
i
was
getting
ready
to
return
to
my
stateroom
when
captain
nemo
turned
to
me
and
said
without
further
preamble
look
at
this
ocean
professor
doesnt
it
have
the
actual
gift
of
life
doesnt
it
experience
both
anger
and
affection
last
evening
it
went
to
sleep
just
as
we
did
and
there
it
is
waking
up
after
a
peaceful
night
no
hellos
or
good
mornings
for
this
gent
you
would
have
thought
this
eccentric
individual
was
simply
continuing
a
conversation
wed
already
started
see
he
went
on
its
waking
up
under
the
suns
caresses
its
going
to
relive
its
daily
existence
what
a
fascinating
field
of
study
lies
in
watching
the
play
of
its
organism
it
owns
a
pulse
and
arteries
it
has
spasms
and
i
side
with
the
scholarly
commander
maury
who
discovered
that
it
has
a
circulation
as
real
as
the
circulation
of
blood
in
animals
im
sure
that
captain
nemo
expected
no
replies
from
me
and
it
seemed
pointless
to
pitch
in
with
ah
yes
exactly
or
how
right
you
are
rather
he
was
simply
talking
to
himself
with
long
pauses
between
sentences
he
was
meditating
out
loud
yes
he
said
the
ocean
owns
a
genuine
circulation
and
to
start
it
going
the
creator
of
all
things
has
only
to
increase
its
heat
salt
and
microscopic
animal
life
in
essence
heat
creates
the
different
densities
that
lead
to
currents
and
countercurrents
evaporation
which
is
nil
in
the
high
arctic
regions
and
very
active
in
equatorial
zones
brings
about
a
constant
interchange
of
tropical
and
polar
waters
whats
more
ive
detected
those
falling
and
rising
currents
that
make
up
the
oceans
true
breathing
ive
seen
a
molecule
of
salt
water
heat
up
at
the
surface
sink
into
the
depths
reach
maximum
density
at
2
degrees
centigrade
then
cool
off
grow
lighter
and
rise
again
at
the
poles
youll
see
the
consequences
of
this
phenomenon
and
through
this
law
of
farseeing
nature
youll
understand
why
water
can
freeze
only
at
the
surface
as
the
captain
was
finishing
his
sentence
i
said
to
myself
the
pole
is
this
brazen
individual
claiming
hell
take
us
even
to
that
location
meanwhile
the
captain
fell
silent
and
stared
at
the
element
he
had
studied
so
thoroughly
and
unceasingly
then
going
on
salts
he
said
fill
the
sea
in
considerable
quantities
professor
and
if
you
removed
all
its
dissolved
saline
content
youd
create
a
mass
measuring
4500000
cubic
leagues
which
if
it
were
spread
all
over
the
globe
would
form
a
layer
more
than
ten
meters
high
and
dont
think
that
the
presence
of
these
salts
is
due
merely
to
some
whim
of
nature
no
they
make
ocean
water
less
open
to
evaporation
and
prevent
winds
from
carrying
off
excessive
amounts
of
steam
which
when
condensing
would
submerge
the
temperate
zones
salts
play
a
leading
role
the
role
of
stabilizer
for
the
general
ecology
of
the
globe
captain
nemo
stopped
straightened
up
took
a
few
steps
along
the
platform
and
returned
to
me
as
for
those
billions
of
tiny
animals
he
went
on
those
infusoria
that
live
by
the
millions
in
one
droplet
of
water
800000
of
which
are
needed
to
weigh
one
milligram
their
role
is
no
less
important
they
absorb
the
marine
salts
they
assimilate
the
solid
elements
in
the
water
and
since
they
create
coral
and
madrepores
theyre
the
true
builders
of
limestone
continents
and
so
after
theyve
finished
depriving
our
water
drop
of
its
mineral
nutrients
the
droplet
gets
lighter
rises
to
the
surface
there
absorbs
more
salts
left
behind
through
evaporation
gets
heavier
sinks
again
and
brings
those
tiny
animals
new
elements
to
absorb
the
outcome
a
double
current
rising
and
falling
constant
movement
constant
life
more
intense
than
on
land
more
abundant
more
infinite
such
life
blooms
in
every
part
of
this
ocean
an
element
fatal
to
man
they
say
but
vital
to
myriads
of
animalsand
to
me
when
captain
nemo
spoke
in
this
way
he
was
transfigured
and
he
filled
me
with
extraordinary
excitement
there
he
added
out
there
lies
true
existence
and
i
can
imagine
the
founding
of
nautical
towns
clusters
of
underwater
households
that
like
the
nautilus
would
return
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
to
breathe
each
morning
free
towns
if
ever
there
were
independent
cities
then
again
who
knows
whether
some
tyrant



captain
nemo
finished
his
sentence
with
a
vehement
gesture
then
addressing
me
directly
as
if
to
drive
away
an
ugly
thought
professor
aronnax
he
asked
me
do
you
know
the
depth
of
the
ocean
floor
at
least
captain
i
know
what
the
major
soundings
tell
us
could
you
quote
them
to
me
so
i
can
doublecheck
them
as
the
need
arises
here
i
replied
are
a
few
of
them
that
stick
in
my
memory
if
im
not
mistaken
an
average
depth
of
8200
meters
was
found
in
the
north
atlantic
and
2500
meters
in
the
mediterranean
the
most
remarkable
soundings
were
taken
in
the
south
atlantic
near
the
35th
parallel
and
they
gave
12000
meters
14091
meters
and
15149
meters
all
in
all
its
estimated
that
if
the
sea
bottom
were
made
level
its
average
depth
would
be
about
seven
kilometers
well
professor
captain
nemo
replied
well
show
you
better
than
that
i
hope
as
for
the
average
depth
of
this
part
of
the
pacific
ill
inform
you
that
its
a
mere
4000
meters
this
said
captain
nemo
headed
to
the
hatch
and
disappeared
down
the
ladder
i
followed
him
and
went
back
to
the
main
lounge
the
propeller
was
instantly
set
in
motion
and
the
log
gave
our
speed
as
twenty
miles
per
hour
over
the
ensuing
days
and
weeks
captain
nemo
was
very
frugal
with
his
visits
i
saw
him
only
at
rare
intervals
his
chief
officer
regularly
fixed
the
positions
i
found
reported
on
the
chart
and
in
such
a
way
that
i
could
exactly
plot
the
nautiluss
course
conseil
and
land
spent
the
long
hours
with
me
conseil
had
told
his
friend
about
the
wonders
of
our
undersea
stroll
and
the
canadian
was
sorry
he
hadnt
gone
along
but
i
hoped
an
opportunity
would
arise
for
a
visit
to
the
forests
of
oceania
almost
every
day
the
panels
in
the
lounge
were
open
for
some
hours
and
our
eyes
never
tired
of
probing
the
mysteries
of
the
underwater
world
the
nautiluss
general
heading
was
southeast
and
it
stayed
at
a
depth
between
100
and
150
meters
however
from
lordknowswhat
whim
one
day
it
did
a
diagonal
dive
by
means
of
its
slanting
fins
reaching
strata
located
2000
meters
underwater
the
thermometer
indicated
a
temperature
of
425
degrees
centigrade
which
at
this
depth
seemed
to
be
a
temperature
common
to
all
latitudes
on
november
26
at
three
oclock
in
the
morning
the
nautilus
cleared
the
tropic
of
cancer
at
longitude
172
degrees
on
the
27th
it
passed
in
sight
of
the
hawaiian
islands
where
the
famous
captain
cook
met
his
death
on
february
14
1779
by
then
we
had
fared
4860
leagues
from
our
starting
point
when
i
arrived
on
the
platform
that
morning
i
saw
the
island
of
hawaii
two
miles
to
leeward
the
largest
of
the
seven
islands
making
up
this
group
i
could
clearly
distinguish
the
tilled
soil
on
its
outskirts
the
various
mountain
chains
running
parallel
with
its
coastline
and
its
volcanoes
crowned
by
mauna
kea
whose
elevation
is
5000
meters
above
sea
level
among
other
specimens
from
these
waterways
our
nets
brought
up
some
peacocktailed
flabellarian
coral
polyps
flattened
into
stylish
shapes
and
unique
to
this
part
of
the
ocean
the
nautilus
kept
to
its
southeasterly
heading
on
december
1
it
cut
the
equator
at
longitude
142
degrees
and
on
the
4th
of
the
same
month
after
a
quick
crossing
marked
by
no
incident
we
raised
the
marquesas
islands
three
miles
off
in
latitude
8
degrees
57
south
and
longitude
139
degrees
32
west
i
spotted
martin
point
on
nuku
hiva
chief
member
of
this
island
group
that
belongs
to
france
i
could
make
out
only
its
wooded
mountains
on
the
horizon
because
captain
nemo
hated
to
hug
shore
there
our
nets
brought
up
some
fine
fish
samples
dolphinfish
with
azure
fins
gold
tails
and
flesh
thats
unrivaled
in
the
entire
world
wrasse
from
the
genus
hologymnosus
that
were
nearly
denuded
of
scales
but
exquisite
in
flavor
knifejaws
with
bony
beaks
yellowish
albacore
that
were
as
tasty
as
bonito
all
fish
worth
classifying
in
the
ships
pantry
after
leaving
these
delightful
islands
to
the
protection
of
the
french
flag
the
nautilus
covered
about
2000
miles
from
december
4
to
the
11th
its
navigating
was
marked
by
an
encounter
with
an
immense
school
of
squid
unusual
mollusks
that
are
near
neighbors
of
the
cuttlefish
french
fishermen
give
them
the
name
cuckoldfish
and
they
belong
to
the
class
cephalopoda
family
dibranchiata
consisting
of
themselves
together
with
cuttlefish
and
argonauts
the
naturalists
of
antiquity
made
a
special
study
of
them
and
these
animals
furnished
many
ribald
figures
of
speech
for
soapbox
orators
in
the
greek
marketplace
as
well
as
excellent
dishes
for
the
tables
of
rich
citizens
if
were
to
believe
athenaeus
a
greek
physician
predating
galen
it
was
during
the
night
of
december
910
that
the
nautilus
encountered
this
army
of
distinctly
nocturnal
mollusks
they
numbered
in
the
millions
they
were
migrating
from
the
temperate
zones
toward
zones
still
warmer
following
the
itineraries
of
herring
and
sardines
we
stared
at
them
through
our
thick
glass
windows
they
swam
backward
with
tremendous
speed
moving
by
means
of
their
locomotive
tubes
chasing
fish
and
mollusks
eating
the
little
ones
eaten
by
the
big
ones
and
tossing
in
indescribable
confusion
the
ten
feet
that
nature
has
rooted
in
their
heads
like
a
hairpiece
of
pneumatic
snakes
despite
its
speed
the
nautilus
navigated
for
several
hours
in
the
midst
of
this
school
of
animals
and
its
nets
brought
up
an
incalculable
number
among
which
i
recognized
all
nine
species
that
professor
orbigny
has
classified
as
native
to
the
pacific
ocean
during
this
crossing
the
sea
continually
lavished
us
with
the
most
marvelous
sights
its
variety
was
infinite
it
changed
its
setting
and
decor
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
our
eyes
and
we
were
called
upon
not
simply
to
contemplate
the
works
of
our
creator
in
the
midst
of
the
liquid
element
but
also
to
probe
the
oceans
most
daunting
mysteries
during
the
day
of
december
11
i
was
busy
reading
in
the
main
lounge
ned
land
and
conseil
were
observing
the
luminous
waters
through
the
gaping
panels
the
nautilus
was
motionless
its
ballast
tanks
full
it
was
sitting
at
a
depth
of
1000
meters
in
a
comparatively
unpopulated
region
of
the
ocean
where
only
larger
fish
put
in
occasional
appearances
just
then
i
was
studying
a
delightful
book
by
jean
mac
the
servants
of
the
stomach
and
savoring
its
ingenious
teachings
when
conseil
interrupted
my
reading
would
master
kindly
come
here
for
an
instant
he
said
to
me
in
an
odd
voice
what
is
it
conseil
its
something
that
master
should
see
i
stood
up
went
leaned
on
my
elbows
before
the
window
and
i
saw
it
in
the
broad
electric
daylight
an
enormous
black
mass
quite
motionless
hung
suspended
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
i
observed
it
carefully
trying
to
find
out
the
nature
of
this
gigantic
cetacean
then
a
sudden
thought
crossed
my
mind
a
ship
i
exclaimed
yes
the
canadian
replied
a
disabled
craft
thats
sinking
straight
down
ned
land
was
not
mistaken
we
were
in
the
presence
of
a
ship
whose
severed
shrouds
still
hung
from
their
clasps
its
hull
looked
in
good
condition
and
it
must
have
gone
under
only
a
few
hours
before
the
stumps
of
three
masts
chopped
off
two
feet
above
the
deck
indicated
a
flooding
ship
that
had
been
forced
to
sacrifice
its
masting
but
it
had
heeled
sideways
filling
completely
and
it
was
listing
to
port
even
yet
a
sorry
sight
this
carcass
lost
under
the
waves
but
sorrier
still
was
the
sight
on
its
deck
where
lashed
with
ropes
to
prevent
their
being
washed
overboard
some
human
corpses
still
lay
i
counted
four
of
themfour
men
one
still
standing
at
the
helmthen
a
woman
halfway
out
of
a
skylight
on
the
afterdeck
holding
a
child
in
her
arms
this
woman
was
young
under
the
brilliant
lighting
of
the
nautiluss
rays
i
could
make
out
her
features
which
the
water
hadnt
yet
decomposed
with
a
supreme
effort
she
had
lifted
her
child
above
her
head
and
the
poor
little
creatures
arms
were
still
twined
around
its
mothers
neck
the
postures
of
the
four
seamen
seemed
ghastly
to
me
twisted
from
convulsive
movements
as
if
making
a
last
effort
to
break
loose
from
the
ropes
that
bound
them
to
their
ship
and
the
helmsman
standing
alone
calmer
his
face
smooth
and
serious
his
grizzled
hair
plastered
to
his
brow
his
hands
clutching
the
wheel
seemed
even
yet
to
be
guiding
his
wrecked
threemaster
through
the
ocean
depths
what
a
scene
we
stood
dumbstruck
hearts
pounding
before
this
shipwreck
caught
in
the
act
as
if
it
had
been
photographed
in
its
final
moments
so
to
speak
and
already
i
could
see
enormous
sharks
moving
in
eyes
ablaze
drawn
by
the
lure
of
human
flesh
meanwhile
turning
the
nautilus
made
a
circle
around
the
sinking
ship
and
for
an
instant
i
could
read
the
board
on
its
stern
the
florida
sunderland
england
chapter
19
vanikoro
this
dreadful
sight
was
the
first
of
a
whole
series
of
maritime
catastrophes
that
the
nautilus
would
encounter
on
its
run
when
it
plied
more
heavily
traveled
seas
we
often
saw
wrecked
hulls
rotting
in
midwater
and
farther
down
cannons
shells
anchors
chains
and
a
thousand
other
iron
objects
rusting
away
meanwhile
continuously
swept
along
by
the
nautilus
where
we
lived
in
near
isolation
we
raised
the
tuamotu
islands
on
december
11
that
old
dangerous
group
associated
with
the
french
global
navigator
commander
bougainville
it
stretches
from
ducie
island
to
lazareff
island
over
an
area
of
500
leagues
from
the

between
latitude
13

south
and
between
longitude
125
degrees
30
and
151
degrees
30
west
this
island
group
covers
a
surface
area
of
370
square
leagues
and
its
made
up
of
some
sixty
subgroups
among
which
we
noted
the
gambier
group
which
is
a
french
protectorate
these
islands
are
coral
formations
thanks
to
the
work
of
polyps
a
slow
but
steady
upheaval
will
someday
connect
these
islands
to
each
other
later
on
this
new
island
will
be
fused
to
its
neighboring
island
groups
and
a
fifth
continent
will
stretch
from
new
zealand
and
new
caledonia
as
far
as
the
marquesas
islands
the
day
i
expounded
this
theory
to
captain
nemo
he
answered
me
coldly
the
earth
doesnt
need
new
continents
but
new
men
sailors
luck
led
the
nautilus
straight
to
reao
island
one
of
the
most
unusual
in
this
group
which
was
discovered
in
1822
by
captain
bell
aboard
the
minerva
so
i
was
able
to
study
the
madreporic
process
that
has
created
the
islands
in
this
ocean
madrepores
which
one
must
guard
against
confusing
with
precious
coral
clothe
their
tissue
in
a
limestone
crust
and
their
variations
in
structure
have
led
my
famous
mentor
professor
milneedwards
to
classify
them
into
five
divisions
the
tiny
microscopic
animals
that
secrete
this
polypary
live
by
the
billions
in
the
depths
of
their
cells
their
limestone
deposits
build
up
into
rocks
reefs
islets
islands
in
some
places
they
form
atolls
a
circular
ring
surrounding
a
lagoon
or
small
inner
lake
that
gaps
place
in
contact
with
the
sea
elsewhere
they
take
the
shape
of
barrier
reefs
such
as
those
that
exist
along
the
coasts
of
new
caledonia
and
several
of
the
tuamotu
islands
in
still
other
localities
such
as
runion
island
and
the
island
of
mauritius
they
build
fringing
reefs
high
straight
walls
next
to
which
the
oceans
depth
is
considerable
while
cruising
along
only
a
few
cable
lengths
from
the
underpinning
of
reao
island
i
marveled
at
the
gigantic
piece
of
work
accomplished
by
these
microscopic
laborers
these
walls
were
the
express
achievements
of
madrepores
known
by
the
names
fire
coral
finger
coral
star
coral
and
stony
coral
these
polyps
grow
exclusively
in
the
agitated
strata
at
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
so
its
in
the
upper
reaches
that
they
begin
these
substructures
which
sink
little
by
little
together
with
the
secreted
rubble
binding
them
this
at
least
is
the
theory
of
mr
charles
darwin
who
thus
explains
the
formation
of
atollsa
theory
superior
in
my
view
to
the
one
that
says
these
madreporic
edifices
sit
on
the
summits
of
mountains
or
volcanoes
submerged
a
few
feet
below
sea
level
i
could
observe
these
strange
walls
quite
closely
our
sounding
lines
indicated
that
they
dropped
perpendicularly
for
more
than
300
meters
and
our
electric
beams
made
the
bright
limestone
positively
sparkle
in
reply
to
a
question
conseil
asked
me
about
the
growth
rate
of
these
colossal
barriers
i
thoroughly
amazed
him
by
saying
that
scientists
put
it
at
an
eighth
of
an
inch
per
biennium
therefore
he
said
to
me
to
build
these
walls
it
took




192000
years
my
gallant
conseil
which
significantly
extends
the
biblical
days
of
creation
whats
more
the
formation
of
coalin
other
words
the
petrification
of
forests
swallowed
by
floodsand
the
cooling
of
basaltic
rocks
likewise
call
for
a
much
longer
period
of
time
i
might
add
that
those
days
in
the
bible
must
represent
whole
epochs
and
not
literally
the
lapse
of
time
between
two
sunrises
because
according
to
the
bible
itself
the
sun
doesnt
date
from
the
first
day
of
creation
when
the
nautilus
returned
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
i
could
take
in
reao
island
over
its
whole
flat
wooded
expanse
obviously
its
madreporic
rocks
had
been
made
fertile
by
tornadoes
and
thunderstorms
one
day
carried
off
by
a
hurricane
from
neighboring
shores
some
seed
fell
onto
these
limestone
beds
mixing
with
decomposed
particles
of
fish
and
marine
plants
to
form
vegetable
humus
propelled
by
the
waves
a
coconut
arrived
on
this
new

its

took

we
had
left
the
alluring
society
islands
in
the
west
likewise
elegant
tahiti
queen
of
the
pacific
in
the
morning
i
spotted
this
islands
lofty
summits
a
few
miles
to
leeward
its
waters
supplied
excellent
fish
for
the
tables
on
board
mackerel
bonito
albacore
and
a
few
varieties
of
that
sea
serpent
named
the
moray
eel
the
nautilus
had
cleared
8100
miles
we
logged
9720
miles
when
we
passed
between
the
tonga
islands
where
crews
from
the
argo
portauprince
and
duke
of
portland
had
perished
and
the
island
group
of
samoa
scene
of
the
slaying
of
captain
de
langle
friend
of
that
longlost
navigator
the
count
de
la
prouse
then
we
raised
the
fiji
islands
where
savages
slaughtered
sailors
from
the
union
as
well
as
captain
bureau
commander
of
the
darling

out
of
nantes

extending
over
an
expanse
of
100
leagues
north
to
south
and
over
90
leagues
east
to
west
this
island
group
lies
between
latitude
2
degrees
and
6
degrees
south
and
between
longitude
174
degrees
and
179
degrees
west
it
consists
of
a
number
of
islands
islets
and
reefs
among
which
we
noted
the
islands
of
viti
levu
vanua
levu
and
kadavu
it
was
the
dutch
navigator
tasman
who
discovered
this
group
in
1643
the
same
year
the
italian
physicist
torricelli
invented
the
barometer
and
king
louis
xiv
ascended
the
french
throne
ill
let
the
reader
decide
which
of
these
deeds
was
more
beneficial
to
humanity
coming
later
captain
cook
in
1774
rear
admiral
dentrecasteaux
in
1793
and
finally
captain
dumont
durville
in
1827
untangled
the
whole
chaotic
geography
of
this
island
group
the
nautilus
drew
near
wailea
bay
an
unlucky
place
for
englands
captain
dillon
who
was
the
first
to
shed
light
on
the
longstanding
mystery
surrounding
the
disappearance
of
ships
under
the
count
de
la
prouse
this
bay
repeatedly
dredged
furnished
a
huge
supply
of
excellent
oysters
as
the
roman
playwright
seneca
recommended
we
opened
them
right
at
our
table
then
stuffed
ourselves
these
mollusks
belonged
to
the
species
known
by
name
as
ostrea
lamellosa
whose
members
are
quite
common
off
corsica
this
wailea
oysterbank
must
have
been
extensive
and
for
certain
if
they
hadnt
been
controlled
by
numerous
natural
checks
these
clusters
of
shellfish
would
have
ended
up
jampacking
the
bay
since
as
many
as
2000000
eggs
have
been
counted
in
a
single
individual
and
if
mr
ned
land
did
not
repent
of
his
gluttony
at
our
oyster
fest
its
because
oysters
are
the
only
dish
that
never
causes
indigestion
in
fact
it
takes
no
less
than
sixteen
dozen
of
these
headless
mollusks
to
supply
the
315
grams
that
satisfy
one
mans
minimum
daily
requirement
for
nitrogen

the
nautilus
navigated
amid
the
island
group
of
the
new
hebrides
which
the
portuguese
seafarer
queirs
discovered
in
1606
which
commander
bougainville
explored
in
1768
and
to
which
captain
cook
gave
its
current
name
in
1773
this
group
is
chiefly
made
up
of
nine
large
islands
and
forms
a
120league
strip
from
the
northnorthwest
to
the
southsoutheast
lying
between
latitude
2
degrees
and
15
degrees
south
and
between
longitude
164
degrees
and
168
degrees
at
the
moment
of
our
noon
sights
we
passed
fairly
close
to
the
island
of
aurou
which
looked
to
me
like
a
mass
of
green
woods
crowned
by
a
peak
of
great
height
that
day
it
was
yuletide
and
it
struck
me
that
ned
land
badly
missed
celebrating
christmas
that
genuine
family
holiday
where
protestants
are
such
zealots
i
hadnt
seen
captain
nemo
for
over
a
week
when
on
the
morning
of
the
27th
he
entered
the
main
lounge
as
usual
acting
as
if
hed
been
gone
for
just
five
minutes
i
was
busy
tracing
the
nautiluss
course
on
the
world
map
the
captain
approached
placed
a
finger
over
a
position
on
the
chart
and
pronounced
just
one
word
vanikoro
this
name
was
magic
it
was
the
name
of
those
islets
where
vessels
under
the
count
de
la
prouse
had
miscarried
i
straightened
suddenly
the
nautilus
is
bringing
us
to
vanikoro
i
asked
yes
professor
the
captain
replied
and
ill
be
able
to
visit
those
famous
islands
where
the
compass
and
the
astrolabe
came
to
grief
if
you
like
professor
when
will
we
reach
vanikoro
we
already
have
professor
followed
by
captain
nemo
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
and
from
there
my
eyes
eagerly
scanned
the
horizon
in
the
northeast
there
emerged
two
volcanic
islands
of
unequal
size
surrounded
by
a
coral
reef
whose
circuit
measured
forty
miles
we
were
facing
the
island
of
vanikoro
proper
to
which
captain
dumont
durville
had
given
the
name
island
of
the
search
we
lay
right
in
front
of
the
little
harbor
of
vana
located
in
latitude
16
degrees
4
south
and
longitude
164
degrees
32
east
its
shores
seemed
covered
with
greenery
from
its
beaches
to
its
summits
inland
crowned
by
mt
kapogo
which
is
476
fathoms
high
after
clearing
the
outer
belt
of
rocks
via
a
narrow
passageway
the
nautilus
lay
inside
the
breakers
where
the
sea
had
a
depth
of
thirty
to
forty
fathoms
under
the
green
shade
of
some
tropical
evergreens
i
spotted
a
few
savages
who
looked
extremely
startled
at
our
approach
in
this
long
blackish
object
advancing
flush
with
the
water
didnt
they
see
some
fearsome
cetacean
that
they
were
obliged
to
view
with
distrust
just
then
captain
nemo
asked
me
what
i
knew
about
the
shipwreck
of
the
count
de
la
prouse
what
everybody
knows
captain
i
answered
him
and
could
you
kindly
tell
me
what
everybody
knows
he
asked
me
in
a
gently
ironic
tone
very
easily
i
related
to
him
what
the
final
deeds
of
captain
dumont
durville
had
brought
to
light
deeds
described
here
in
this
heavily
condensed
summary
of
the
whole
matter
in
1785
the
count
de
la
prouse
and
his
subordinate
captain
de
langle
were
sent
by
king
louis
xvi
of
france
on
a
voyage
to
circumnavigate
the
globe
they
boarded
two
sloops
of
war
the
compass
and
the
astrolabe
which
were
never
seen
again
in
1791
justly
concerned
about
the
fate
of
these
two
sloops
of
war
the
french
government
fitted
out
two
large
cargo
boats
the
search
and
the
hope
which
left
brest
on
september
28
under
orders
from
rear
admiral
bruni
dentrecasteaux
two
months
later
testimony
from
a
certain
commander
bowen
aboard
the
albemarle
alleged
that
rubble
from
shipwrecked
vessels
had
been
seen
on
the
coast
of
new
georgia
but
dentrecasteaux
was
unaware
of
this
newswhich
seemed
a
bit
dubious
anyhowand
headed
toward
the
admiralty
islands
which
had
been
named
in
a
report
by
one
captain
hunter
as
the
site
of
the
count
de
la
prouses
shipwreck
they
looked
in
vain
the
hope
and
the
search
passed
right
by
vanikoro
without
stopping
there
and
overall
this
voyage
was
plagued
by
misfortune
ultimately
costing
the
lives
of
rear
admiral
dentrecasteaux
two
of
his
subordinate
officers
and
several
seamen
from
his
crew
it
was
an
old
hand
at
the
pacific
the
english
adventurer
captain
peter
dillon
who
was
the
first
to
pick
up
the
trail
left
by
castaways
from
the
wrecked
vessels
on
may
15
1824
his
ship
the
st
patrick
passed
by
tikopia
island
one
of
the
new
hebrides
there
a
native
boatman
pulled
alongside
in
a
dugout
canoe
and
sold
dillon
a
silver
sword
hilt
bearing
the
imprint
of
characters
engraved
with
a
cutting
tool
known
as
a
burin
furthermore
this
native
boatman
claimed
that
during
a
stay
in
vanikoro
six
years
earlier
he
had
seen
two
europeans
belonging
to
ships
that
had
run
aground
on
the
islands
reefs
many
years
before
dillon
guessed
that
the
ships
at
issue
were
those
under
the
count
de
la
prouse
ships
whose
disappearance
had
shaken
the
entire
world
he
tried
to
reach
vanikoro
where
according
to
the
native
boatman
a
good
deal
of
rubble
from
the
shipwreck
could
still
be
found
but
winds
and
currents
prevented
his
doing
so
dillon
returned
to
calcutta
there
he
was
able
to
interest
the
asiatic
society
and
the
east
india
company
in
his
discovery
a
ship
named
after
the
search
was
placed
at
his
disposal
and
he
departed
on
january
23
1827
accompanied
by
a
french
deputy
this
new
search
after
putting
in
at
several
stops
over
the
pacific
dropped
anchor
before
vanikoro
on
july
7
1827
in
the
same
harbor
of
vana
where
the
nautilus
was
currently
floating
there
dillon
collected
many
relics
of
the
shipwreck
iron
utensils
anchors
eyelets
from
pulleys
swivel
guns
an
eighteenpound
shell
the
remains
of
some
astronomical
instruments
a
piece
of
sternrail
and
a
bronze
bell
bearing
the
inscription
made
by
bazin
the
foundry
mark
at
brest
arsenal
around
1785
there
could
no
longer
be
any
doubt
finishing
his
investigations
dillon
stayed
at
the
site
of
the
casualty
until
the
month
of
october
then
he
left
vanikoro
headed
toward
new
zealand
dropped
anchor
at
calcutta
on
april
7
1828
and
returned
to
france
where
he
received
a
very
cordial
welcome
from
king
charles
x
but
just
then
the
renowned
french
explorer
captain
dumont
durville
unaware
of
dillons
activities
had
already
set
sail
to
search
elsewhere
for
the
site
of
the
shipwreck
in
essence
a
whaling
vessel
had
reported
that
some
medals
and
a
cross
of
st
louis
had
been
found
in
the
hands
of
savages
in
the
louisiade
islands
and
new
caledonia
so
captain
dumont
durville
had
put
to
sea
in
command
of
a
vessel
named
after
the
astrolabe
and
just
two
months
after
dillon
had
left
vanikoro
dumont
durville
dropped
anchor
before
hobart
there
he
heard
about
dillons
findings
and
he
further
learned
that
a
certain
james
hobbs
chief
officer
on
the
union
out
of
calcutta
had
put
to
shore
on
an
island
located
in
latitude
8
degrees
18
south
and
longitude
156
degrees
30
east
and
had
noted
the
natives
of
those
waterways
making
use
of
iron
bars
and
red
fabrics
pretty
perplexed
dumont
durville
didnt
know
if
he
should
give
credence
to
these
reports
which
had
been
carried
in
some
of
the
less
reliable
newspapers
nevertheless
he
decided
to
start
on
dillons
trail
on
february
10
1828
the
new
astrolabe
hove
before
tikopia
island
took
on
a
guide
and
interpreter
in
the
person
of
a
deserter
who
had
settled
there
plied
a
course
toward
vanikoro
raised
it
on
february
12
sailed
along
its
reefs
until
the
14th
and
only
on
the
20th
dropped
anchor
inside
its
barrier
in
the
harbor
of
vana
on
the
23rd
several
officers
circled
the
island
and
brought
back
some
rubble
of
little
importance
the
natives
adopting
a
system
of
denial
and
evasion
refused
to
guide
them
to
the
site
of
the
casualty
this
rather
shady
conduct
aroused
the
suspicion
that
the
natives
had
mistreated
the
castaways
and
in
truth
the
natives
seemed
afraid
that
dumont
durville
had
come
to
avenge
the
count
de
la
prouse
and
his
unfortunate
companions
but
on
the
26th
appeased
with
gifts
and
seeing
that
they
didnt
need
to
fear
any
reprisals
the
natives
led
the
chief
officer
mr
jacquinot
to
the
site
of
the
shipwreck
at
this
location
in
three
or
four
fathoms
of
water
between
the
paeu
and
vana
reefs
there
lay
some
anchors
cannons
and
ingots
of
iron
and
lead
all
caked
with
limestone
concretions
a
launch
and
whaleboat
from
the
new
astrolabe
were
steered
to
this
locality
and
after
going
to
exhausting
lengths
their
crews
managed
to
dredge
up
an
anchor
weighing
1800
pounds
a
castiron
eightpounder
cannon
a
lead
ingot
and
two
copper
swivel
guns
questioning
the
natives
captain
dumont
durville
also
learned
that
after
la
prouses
two
ships
had
miscarried
on
the
islands
reefs
the
count
had
built
a
smaller
craft
only
to
go
off
and
miscarry
a
second
time
where
nobody
knew
the
commander
of
the
new
astrolabe
then
had
a
monument
erected
under
a
tuft
of
mangrove
in
memory
of
the
famous
navigator
and
his
companions
it
was
a
simple
quadrangular
pyramid
set
on
a
coral
base
with
no
ironwork
to
tempt
the
natives
avarice
then
dumont
durville
tried
to
depart
but
his
crews
were
run
down
from
the
fevers
raging
on
these
unsanitary
shores
and
quite
ill
himself
he
was
unable
to
weigh
anchor
until
march
17
meanwhile
fearing
that
dumont
durville
wasnt
abreast
of
dillons
activities
the
french
government
sent
a
sloop
of
war
to
vanikoro
the
bayonnaise
under
commander
legoarant
de
tromelin
who
had
been
stationed
on
the
american
west
coast
dropping
anchor
before
vanikoro
a
few
months
after
the
new
astrolabes
departure
the
bayonnaise
didnt
find
any
additional
evidence
but
verified
that
the
savages
hadnt
disturbed
the
memorial
honoring
the
count
de
la
prouse
this
is
the
substance
of
the
account
i
gave
captain
nemo
so
he
said
to
me
the
castaways
built
a
third
ship
on
vanikoro
island
and
to
this
day
nobody
knows
where
it
went
and
perished
nobody
knows
captain
nemo
didnt
reply
but
signaled
me
to
follow
him
to
the
main
lounge
the
nautilus
sank
a
few
meters
beneath
the
waves
and
the
panels
opened
i
rushed
to
the
window
and
saw
crusts
of
coral
fungus
coral
siphonula
coral
alcyon
coral
sea
anemone
from
the
genus
caryophylia
plus
myriads
of
charming
fish
including
greenfish
damselfish
sweepers
snappers
and
squirrelfish
underneath
this
coral
covering
i
detected
some
rubble
the
old
dredges
hadnt
been
able
to
tear
freeiron
stirrups
anchors
cannons
shells
tackle
from
a
capstan
a
stempost
all
objects
hailing
from
the
wrecked
ships
and
now
carpeted
in
moving
flowers
and
as
i
stared
at
this
desolate
wreckage
captain
nemo
told
me
in
a
solemn
voice
commander
la
prouse
set
out
on
december
7
1785
with
his
ships
the
compass
and
the
astrolabe
he
dropped
anchor
first
at
botany
bay
visited
the
tonga
islands
and
new
caledonia
headed
toward
the
santa
cruz
islands
and
put
in
at
nomuka
one
of
the
islands
in
the
haapai
group
then
his
ships
arrived
at
the
unknown
reefs
of
vanikoro
traveling
in
the
lead
the
compass
ran
afoul
of
breakers
on
the
southerly
coast
the
astrolabe
went
to
its
rescue
and
also
ran
aground
the
first
ship
was
destroyed
almost
immediately
the
second
stranded
to
leeward
held
up
for
some
days
the
natives
gave
the
castaways
a
fair
enough
welcome
the
latter
took
up
residence
on
the
island
and
built
a
smaller
craft
with
rubble
from
the
two
large
ones
a
few
seamen
stayed
voluntarily
in
vanikoro
the
others
weak
and
ailing
set
sail
with
the
count
de
la
prouse
they
headed
to
the
solomon
islands
and
they
perished
with
all
hands
on
the
westerly
coast
of
the
chief
island
in
that
group
between
cape
deception
and
cape
satisfaction
and
how
do
you
know
all
this
i
exclaimed
heres
what
i
found
at
the
very
site
of
that
final
shipwreck
captain
nemo
showed
me
a
tin
box
stamped
with
the
coat
of
arms
of
france
and
all
corroded
by
salt
water
he
opened
it
and
i
saw
a
bundle
of
papers
yellowed
but
still
legible
they
were
the
actual
military
orders
given
by
frances
minister
of
the
navy
to
commander
la
prouse
with
notes
along
the
margin
in
the
handwriting
of
king
louis
xvi
ah
what
a
splendid
death
for
a
seaman
captain
nemo
then
said
a
coral
grave
is
a
tranquil
grave

heaven
grant

the
torres
strait
during
the
night
of
december
2728
the
nautilus
left
the
waterways
of
vanikoro
behind
with
extraordinary
speed
its
heading
was
southwesterly
and
in
three
days
it
had
cleared
the
750
leagues
that
separated
la
prouses
islands
from
the
southeastern
tip
of
papua
on
january
1
1868
bright
and
early
conseil
joined
me
on
the
platform
will
master
the
gallant
lad
said
to
me
allow
me
to
wish
him
a
happy
new
year
good
heavens
conseil
its
just
like
old
times
in
my
office
at
the
botanical
gardens
in
paris
i
accept
your
kind
wishes
and
i
thank
you
for
them
only
id
like
to
know
what
you
mean
by
a
happy
year
under
the
circumstances
in
which
were
placed
is
it
a
year
that
will
bring
our
imprisonment
to
an
end
or
a
year
that
will
see
this
strange
voyage
continue
ye
gods
conseil
replied
i
hardly
know
what
to
tell
master
were
certainly
seeing
some
unusual
things
and
for
two
months
weve
had
no
time
for
boredom
the
latest
wonder
is
always
the
most
astonishing
and
if
this
progression
keeps
up
i
cant
imagine
what
its
climax
will
be
in
my
opinion
well
never
again
have
such
an
opportunity
never
conseil
besides
mr
nemo
really
lives
up
to
his
latin
name
since
he
couldnt
be
less
in
the
way
if
he
didnt
exist
true
enough
conseil
therefore
with
all
due
respect
to
master
i
think
a
happy
year
would
be
a
year
that
lets
us
see
everything
everything
conseil
no
year
could
be
that
long
but
what
does
ned
land
think
about
all
this
ned
lands
thoughts
are
exactly
the
opposite
of
mine
conseil
replied
he
has
a
practical
mind
and
a
demanding
stomach
hes
tired
of
staring
at
fish
and
eating
them
day
in
and
day
out
this
shortage
of
wine
bread
and
meat
isnt
suitable
for
an
upstanding
anglosaxon
a
man
accustomed
to
beefsteak
and
unfazed
by
regular
doses
of
brandy
or
gin
for
my
part
conseil
that
doesnt
bother
me
in
the
least
and
ive
adjusted
very
nicely
to
the
diet
on
board
so
have
i
conseil
replied
accordingly
i
think
as
much
about
staying
as
mr
land
about
making
his
escape
thus
if
this
new
year
isnt
a
happy
one
for
me
it
will
be
for
him
and
vice
versa
no
matter
what
happens
one
of
us
will
be
pleased
so
in
conclusion
i
wish
master
to
have
whatever
his
heart
desires
thank
you
conseil
only
i
must
ask
you
to
postpone
the
question
of
new
years
gifts
and
temporarily
accept
a
hearty
handshake
in
their
place
thats
all
i
have
on
me
master
has
never
been
more
generous
conseil
replied
and
with
that
the
gallant
lad
went
away
by
january
2
we
had
fared
11340
miles
hence
5250
leagues
from
our
starting
point
in
the
seas
of
japan
before
the
nautiluss
spur
there
stretched
the
dangerous
waterways
of
the
coral
sea
off
the
northeast
coast
of
australia
our
boat
cruised
along
a
few
miles
away
from
that
daunting
shoal
where
captain
cooks
ships
wellnigh
miscarried
on
june
10
1770
the
craft
that
cook
was
aboard
charged
into
some
coral
rock
and
if
his
vessel
didnt
go
down
it
was
thanks
to
the
circumstance
that
a
piece
of
coral
broke
off
in
the
collision
and
plugged
the
very
hole
it
had
made
in
the
hull
i
would
have
been
deeply
interested
in
visiting
this
long
360league
reef
against
which
the
eversurging
sea
broke
with
the
fearsome
intensity
of
thunderclaps
but
just
then
the
nautiluss
slanting
fins
took
us
to
great
depths
and
i
could
see
nothing
of
those
high
coral
walls
i
had
to
rest
content
with
the
various
specimens
of
fish
brought
up
by
our
nets
among
others
i
noted
some
longfinned
albacore
a
species
in
the
genus
scomber
as
big
as
tuna
bluish
on
the
flanks
and
streaked
with
crosswise
stripes
that
disappear
when
the
animal
dies
these
fish
followed
us
in
schools
and
supplied
our
table
with
very
dainty
flesh
we
also
caught
a
large
number
of
yellowgreen
gilthead
half
a
decimeter
long
and
tasting
like
dorado
plus
some
flying
gurnards
authentic
underwater
swallows
that
on
dark
nights
alternately
streak
air
and
water
with
their
phosphorescent
glimmers
among
mollusks
and
zoophytes
i
found
in
our
trawls
meshes
various
species
of
alcyonarian
coral
sea
urchins
hammer
shells
spurredstar
shells
wentletrap
snails
horn

the

kelp
from
the
genus
macrocystis
saturated
with
the
mucilage
their
pores
perspire
from
which
i
selected
a
wonderful
nemastoma
geliniaroidea
classifying
it
with
the
natural
curiosities
in
the
museum
on
january
4
two
days
after
crossing
the
coral
sea
we
raised
the
coast
of
papua
on
this
occasion
captain
nemo
told
me
that
he
intended
to
reach
the
indian
ocean
via
the
torres
strait
this
was
the
extent
of
his
remarks
ned
saw
with
pleasure
that
this
course
would
bring
us
once
again
closer
to
european
seas
the
torres
strait
is
regarded
as
no
less
dangerous
for
its
bristling
reefs
than
for
the
savage
inhabitants
of
its
coasts
it
separates
queensland
from
the
huge
island
of
papua
also
called

400

with
a

15
at
noon
while
the
chief
officer
was
taking
the
suns
altitude
i
spotted
the
summits
of
the
arfak
mountains
rising
in
terraces
and
ending
in
sharp
peaks
discovered
in
1511
by
the
portuguese
francisco
serrano
these

mr
de

has
said
and
i
hadnt
the
foggiest
inkling
that
sailors
luck
was
about
to
bring
me
face
to
face
with
these
daunting
andaman
aborigines
so
the
nautilus
hove
before
the
entrance
to
the
worlds
most
dangerous
strait
a
passageway
that
even
the
boldest
navigators
hesitated
to
clear
the
strait
that
luis
vaez
de
torres
faced
on
returning
from
the
south
seas
in
melanesia
the
strait
in
which
sloops
of
war
under
captain
dumont
durville
ran
aground
in
1840
and
nearly
miscarried
with
all
hands
and
even
the
nautilus
rising
superior
to
every
danger
in
the
sea
was
about
to
become
intimate
with
its
coral
reefs
the
torres
strait
is
about
thirtyfour
leagues
wide
but
its
obstructed
by
an
incalculable
number
of
islands
islets
breakers
and
rocks
that
make
it
nearly
impossible
to
navigate
consequently
captain
nemo
took
every
desired
precaution
in
crossing
it
floating
flush
with
the
water
the
nautilus
moved
ahead
at
a
moderate
pace
like
a
cetaceans
tail
its
propeller
churned
the
waves
slowly
taking
advantage
of
this
situation
my
two
companions
and
i
found
seats
on
the
everdeserted
platform
in
front
of
us
stood
the
pilothouse
and
unless
im
extremely
mistaken
captain
nemo
must
have
been
inside
steering
his
nautilus
himself
under
my
eyes
i
had
the
excellent
charts
of
the
torres
strait
that
had
been
surveyed
and
drawn
up
by
the
hydrographic
engineer
vincendon
dumoulin
and
sublieutenant
now
admiral
coupventdesbois
who
were
part
of
dumont
durvilles
general
staff
during
his
final
voyage
to
circumnavigate
the
globe
these
along
with
the
efforts
of
captain
king
are
the
best
charts
for
untangling
the
snarl
of
this
narrow
passageway
and
i
consulted
them
with
scrupulous
care
around
the
nautilus
the
sea
was
boiling
furiously
a
stream
of
waves
bearing
from
southeast
to
northwest
at
a
speed
of
two
and
a
half
miles
per
hour
broke
over
heads
of
coral
emerging
here
and
there
thats
one
rough
sea
ned
land
told
me
abominable
indeed
i
replied
and
hardly
suitable
for
a
craft
like
the
nautilus
that
damned
captain
the
canadian
went
on
must
really
be
sure
of
his
course
because
if
these
clumps
of
coral
so
much
as
brush
us
theyll
rip
our
hull
into
a
thousand
pieces
the
situation
was
indeed
dangerous
but
as
if
by
magic
the
nautilus
seemed
to
glide
right
down
the
middle
of
these
rampaging
reefs
it
didnt
follow
the
exact
course
of
the
zealous
and
the
new
astrolabe
which
had
proved
so
illfated
for
captain
dumont
durville
it
went
more
to
the
north
hugged
the
murray
islands
and
returned
to
the
southwest
near
cumberland
passage
i
thought
it
was
about
to
charge
wholeheartedly
into
this
opening
but
it
went
up
to
the
northwest
through
a
large
number
of
littleknown
islands
and
islets
and
steered
toward
tound
island
and
the
bad
channel
i
was
already
wondering
if
captain
nemo
rash
to
the
point
of
sheer
insanity
wanted
his
ship
to
tackle
the
narrows
where
dumont
durvilles
two
sloops
of
war
had
gone
aground
when
he
changed
direction
a
second
time
and
cut
straight
to
the
west
heading
toward
gueboroa
island
by
then
it
was
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
the
current
was
slacking
off
it
was
almost
full
tide
the
nautilus
drew
near
this
island
which
i
can
see
to
this
day
with
its
remarkable
fringe
of
screw
pines
we
hugged
it
from
less
than
two
miles
out
a
sudden
jolt
threw
me
down
the
nautilus
had
just
struck
a
reef
and
it
remained
motionless
listing
slightly
to
port
when
i
stood
up
i
saw
captain
nemo
and
his
chief
officer
on
the
platform
they
were
examining
the
ships
circumstances
exchanging
a
few
words
in
their
incomprehensible
dialect
here
is
what
those
circumstances
entailed
two
miles
to
starboard
lay
gueboroa
island
its
coastline
curving
north
to
west
like
an
immense
arm
to
the
south
and
east
heads
of
coral
were
already
on
display
left
uncovered
by
the
ebbing
waters
we
had
run
aground
at
full
tide
and
in
one
of
those
seas
whose
tides
are
moderate
an
inconvenient
state
of
affairs
for
floating
the
nautilus
off
however
the
ship
hadnt
suffered
in
any
way
so
solidly
joined
was
its
hull
but
although
it
could
neither
sink
nor
split
open
it
was
in
serious
danger
of
being
permanently
attached
to
these
reefs
and
that
would
have
been
the
finish
of
captain
nemos
submersible
i
was
mulling
this
over
when
the
captain
approached
cool
and
calm
forever
in
control
of
himself
looking
neither
alarmed
nor
annoyed
an
accident
i
said
to
him
no
an
incident
he
answered
me
but
an
incident
i
replied
that
may
oblige
you
to
become
a
resident
again
of
these
shores
you
avoid
captain
nemo
gave
me
an
odd
look
and
gestured
no
which
told
me
pretty
clearly
that
nothing
would
ever
force
him
to
set
foot
on
a
land
mass
again
then
he
said
no
professor
aronnax
the
nautilus
isnt
consigned
to
perdition
it
will
still
carry
you
through
the
midst
of
the
oceans
wonders
our
voyage
is
just
beginning
and
ive
no
desire
to
deprive
myself
so
soon
of
the
pleasure
of
your
company
even
so
captain
nemo
i
went
on
ignoring
his
ironic
turn
of
phrase
the
nautilus
has
run
aground
at
a
moment
when
the
sea
is
full
now
then
the
tides
arent
strong
in
the
pacific
and
if
you
cant
unballast
the
nautilus
which
seems
impossible
to
me
i
dont
see
how
it
will
float
off
youre
right
professor
the
pacific
tides
arent
strong
captain
nemo
replied
but
in
the
torres
strait
one
still
finds
a
meterandahalf
difference
in
level
between
high
and
low
seas
today
is
january
4
and
in
five
days
the
moon
will
be
full
now
then
ill
be
quite
astonished
if
that
goodnatured
satellite
doesnt
sufficiently
raise
these
masses
of
water
and
do
me
a
favor
for
which
ill
be
forever
grateful
this
said
captain
nemo
went
below
again
to
the
nautiluss
interior
followed
by
his
chief
officer
as
for
our
craft
it
no
longer
stirred
staying
as
motionless
as
if
these
coral
polyps
had
already
walled
it
in
with
their
indestructible
cement
well
sir
ned
land
said
to
me
coming
up
after
the
captains
departure
well
ned
my
friend
well
serenely
wait
for
the
tide
on
the
9th
because
it
seems
the
moon
will
have
the
good
nature
to
float
us
away
as
simple
as
that
as
simple
as
that
so
our
captain
isnt
going
to
drop
his
anchors
put
his
engines
on
the
chains
and
do
anything
to
haul
us
off
since
the
tide
will
be
sufficient
conseil
replied
simply
the
canadian
stared
at
conseil
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
seaman
in
him
was
talking
now
sir
he
answered
you
can
trust
me
when
i
say
this
hunk
of
iron
will
never
navigate
again
on
the
seas
or
under
them
its
only
fit
to
be
sold
for
its
weight
so
i
think
its
time
we
gave
captain
nemo
the
slip
ned
my
friend
i
replied
unlike
you
i
havent
given
up
on
our
valiant
nautilus
and
in
four
days
well
know
where
we
stand
on
these
pacific
tides
besides
an
escape
attempt
might
be
timely
if
we
were
in
sight
of
the
coasts
of
england
or
provence
but
in
the
waterways
of
papua
its
another
story
and
well
always
have
that
as
a
last
resort
if
the
nautilus
doesnt
right
itself
which
id
regard
as
a
real
calamity
but
couldnt
we
at
least
get
the
lay
of
the
land
ned
went
on
heres
an
island
on
this
island
there
are
trees
under
those
trees
land
animals
loaded
with
cutlets
and
roast
beef
which
id
be
happy
to
sink
my
teeth
into
in
this
instance
our
friend
ned
is
right
conseil
said
and
i
side
with
his
views
couldnt
master
persuade
his
friend
captain
nemo
to
send
the
three
of
us
ashore
if
only
so
our
feet
dont
lose
the
knack
of
treading
on
the
solid
parts
of
our
planet
i
can
ask
him
i
replied
but
hell
refuse
let
master
take
the
risk
conseil
said
and
well
know
where
we
stand
on
the
captains
affability
much
to
my
surprise
captain
nemo
gave
me
the
permission
i
asked
for
and
he
did
so
with
grace
and
alacrity
not
even
exacting
my
promise
to
return
on
board
but
fleeing
across
the
new
guinea
territories
would
be
extremely
dangerous
and
i
wouldnt
have
advised
ned
land
to
try
it
better
to
be
prisoners
aboard
the
nautilus
than
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
papuan
natives
the
skiff
was
put
at
our
disposal
for
the
next
morning
i
hardly
needed
to
ask
whether
captain
nemo
would
be
coming
along
i
likewise
assumed
that
no
crewmen
would
be
assigned
to
us
that
ned
land
would
be
in
sole
charge
of
piloting
the
longboat
besides
the
shore
lay
no
more
than
two
miles
off
and
it
would
be
childs
play
for
the
canadian
to
guide
that
nimble
skiff
through
those
rows
of
reefs
so
illfated
for
big
ships
the
next
day
january
5
after
its
deck
paneling
was
opened
the
skiff
was
wrenched
from
its
socket
and
launched
to
sea
from
the
top
of
the
platform
two
men
were
sufficient
for
this
operation
the
oars
were
inside
the
longboat
and
we
had
only
to
take
our
seats
at
eight
oclock
armed
with
rifles
and
axes
we
pulled
clear
of
the
nautilus
the
sea
was
fairly
calm
a
mild
breeze
blew
from
shore
in
place
by
the
oars
conseil
and
i
rowed
vigorously
and
ned
steered
us
into
the
narrow
lanes
between
the
breakers
the
skiff
handled
easily
and
sped
swiftly
ned
land
couldnt
conceal
his
glee
he
was
a
prisoner
escaping
from
prison
and
never
dreaming
he
would
need
to
reenter
it

im
not
saying
fish
arent
good
for
you

we
mustnt
overdo
em
and
a
slice
of
fresh
venison
grilled
over
live
coals
will
be
a
nice
change
from
our

youre
making
my
mouth
water
it
remains
to
be

i
said
whether
these

do
contain

if
the
types
of

arent
of
such
size

the

whose
teeth
seemed
to
be

honed
as

if

some
days
ashore
stepping
ashore
had
an
exhilarating
effect
on
me
ned
land
tested
the
soil
with
his
foot
as
if
he
were
laying
claim
to
it
yet
it
had
been
only
two
months
since
we
had
become
as
captain
nemo
expressed
it
passengers
on
the
nautilus
in
other
words
the
literal
prisoners
of
its
commander
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
a
gunshot
away
from
the
coast
the
soil
was
almost
entirely
madreporic
but
certain
dry
stream
beds
were
strewn
with
granite
rubble
proving
that
this
island
was
of
primordial
origin
the
entire
horizon
was
hidden
behind
a
curtain
of
wonderful
forests
enormous
trees
sometimes
as
high
as
200
feet
were
linked
to
each
other
by
garlands
of
tropical
creepers
genuine
natural
hammocks
that
swayed
in
a
mild
breeze
there
were
mimosas
banyan
trees
beefwood
teakwood
hibiscus
screw
pines
palm
trees
all
mingling
in
wild
profusion
and
beneath
the
shade
of
their
green
canopies
at
the
feet
of
their
gigantic
trunks
there
grew
orchids
leguminous
plants
and
ferns
meanwhile
ignoring
all
these
fine
specimens
of
papuan
flora
the
canadian
passed
up
the
decorative
in
favor
of
the
functional
he
spotted
a
coconut
palm
beat
down
some
of
its
fruit
broke
them
open
and
we
drank
their
milk
and
ate
their
meat
with
a
pleasure
that
was
a
protest
against
our
standard
fare
on
the
nautilus
excellent
ned
land
said
exquisite
conseil
replied
and
i
dont
think
the
canadian
said
that
your
nemo
would
object
to
us
stashing
a
cargo
of
coconuts
aboard
his
vessel
i
imagine
not
i
replied
but
he
wont
want
to
sample
them
too
bad
for
him
conseil
said
and
plenty
good
for
us
ned
land
shot
back
therell
be
more
left
over
a
word
of
caution
mr
land
i
told
the
harpooner
who
was
about
to
ravage
another
coconut
palm
coconuts
are
admirable
things
but
before
we
stuff
the
skiff
with
them
it
would
be
wise
to
find
out
whether
this
island
offers
other
substances
just
as
useful
some
fresh
vegetables
would
be
well
received
in
the
nautiluss
pantry
master
is
right
conseil
replied
and
i
propose
that
we
set
aside
three
places
in
our
longboat
one
for
fruit
another
for
vegetables
and
a
third
for
venison
of
which
i
still
havent
glimpsed
the
tiniest
specimen
dont
give
up
so
easily
conseil
the
canadian
replied
so
lets
continue
our
excursion
i
went
on
but
keep
a
sharp
lookout
this
island
seems
uninhabited
but
it
still
might
harbor
certain
individuals
who
arent
so
finicky
about
the
sort
of
game
they
eat
hee
hee
ned
put
in
with
a
meaningful
movement
of
his
jaws
ned
oh
horrors
conseil
exclaimed
ye
gods
the
canadian
shot
back
im
starting
to
appreciate
the
charms
of
cannibalism
ned
ned
dont
say
that
conseil
answered
you
a
cannibal
why
ill
no
longer
be
safe
next
to
you
i
who
share
your
cabin
does
this
mean
ill
wake
up
half
devoured
one
fine
day
im
awfully
fond
of
you
conseil
my
friend
but
not
enough
to
eat
you
when
theres
better
food
around
then
i
darent
delay
conseil
replied
the
hunt
is
on
we
absolutely
must
bag
some
game
to
placate
this
maneater
or
one
of
these
mornings
master
wont
find
enough
pieces
of
his
manservant
to
serve
him
while
exchanging
this
chitchat
we
entered
beneath
the
dark
canopies
of
the
forest
and
for
two
hours
we
explored
it
in
every
direction
we
couldnt
have
been
luckier
in
our
search
for
edible
vegetation
and
some
of
the
most
useful
produce
in
the
tropical
zones
supplied
us
with
a
valuable
foodstuff
missing
on
board
i
mean
the
breadfruit
tree
which
is
quite
abundant
on
gueboroa
island
and
there
i
chiefly
noted
the
seedless
variety
that
in
malaysia
is
called
rima
this
tree
is
distinguished
from
other
trees
by
a
straight
trunk
forty
feet
high
to
the
naturalists
eye
its
gracefully
rounded
crown
formed
of
big
multilobed
leaves
was
enough
to
denote
the
artocarpus
that
has
been
so
successfully
transplanted
to
the
mascarene
islands
east
of
madagascar
from
its
mass
of
greenery
huge
globular
fruit
stood
out
a
decimeter
wide
and
furnished
on
the
outside
with
creases
that
assumed
a
hexangular
pattern
its
a
handy
plant
that
nature
gives
to
regions
lacking
in
wheat
without
needing
to
be
cultivated
it
bears
fruit
eight
months
out
of
the
year
ned
land
was
on
familiar
terms
with
this
fruit
he
had
already
eaten
it
on
his
many
voyages
and
knew
how
to
cook
its
edible
substance
so
the
very
sight
of
it
aroused
his
appetite
and
he
couldnt
control
himself
sir
he
told
me
ill
die
if
i
dont
sample
a
little
breadfruit
pasta
sample
some
ned
my
friend
sample
all
you
like
were
here
to
conduct
experiments
lets
conduct
them
it
wont
take
a
minute
the
canadian
replied
equipped
with
a
magnifying
glass
he
lit
a
fire
of
deadwood
that
was
soon
crackling
merrily
meanwhile
conseil
and
i
selected
the
finest
artocarpus
fruit
some
still
werent
ripe
enough
and
their
thick
skins
covered
white
slightly
fibrous
pulps
but
a
great
many
others
were
yellowish
and
gelatinous
just
begging
to
be
picked
this
fruit
contained
no
pits
conseil
brought
a
dozen
of
them
to
ned
land
who
cut
them
into
thick
slices
and
placed
them
over
a
fire
of
live
coals
all
the
while
repeating
youll
see
sir
how
tasty
this
bread
is
especially
since
weve
gone
without
baked
goods
for
so
long
conseil
said
its
more
than
just
bread
the
canadian
added
its
a
dainty
pastry
youve
never
eaten
any
sir
no
ned
all
right
get
ready
for
something
downright
delectable
if
you
dont
come
back
for
seconds
im
no
longer
the
king
of
harpooners
after
a
few
minutes
the
parts
of
the
fruit
exposed
to
the
fire
were
completely
toasted
on
the
inside
there
appeared
some
white
pasta
a
sort
of
soft
bread
center
whose
flavor
reminded
me
of
artichoke
this
bread
was
excellent
i
must
admit
and
i
ate
it
with
great
pleasure
unfortunately
i
said
this
pasta
wont
stay
fresh
so
it
seems
pointless
to
make
a
supply
for
on
board
by
thunder
sir
ned
land
exclaimed
there
you
go
talking
like
a
naturalist
but
meantime
ill
be
acting
like
a
baker
conseil
harvest
some
of
this
fruit
to
take
with
us
when
we
go
back
and
how
will
you
prepare
it
i
asked
the
canadian
ill
make
a
fermented
batter
from
its
pulp
thatll
keep
indefinitely
without
spoiling
when
i
want
some
ill
just
cook
it
in
the
galley
on
boarditll
have
a
slightly
tart
flavor
but
youll
find
it
excellent
so
mr
ned
i
see
that
this
bread
is
all
we
need
not
quite
professor
the
canadian
replied
we
need
some
fruit
to
go
with
it
or
at
least
some
vegetables
then
lets
look
for
fruit
and
vegetables
when
our
breadfruit
harvesting
was
done
we
took
to
the
trail
to
complete
this
dryland
dinner
we
didnt
search
in
vain
and
near
noontime
we
had
an
ample
supply
of
bananas
this
delicious
produce
from
the
torrid
zones
ripens
all
year
round
and
malaysians
who
give
them
the
name
pisang
eat
them
without
bothering
to
cook
them
in
addition
to
bananas
we
gathered
some
enormous
jackfruit
with
a
very
tangy
flavor
some
tasty
mangoes
and
some
pineapples
of
unbelievable
size
but
this
foraging
took
up
a
good
deal
of
our
time
which
even
so
we
had
no
cause
to
regret
conseil
kept
ned
under
observation
the
harpooner
walked
in
the
lead
and
during
his
stroll
through
this
forest
he
gathered
with
sure
hands
some
excellent
fruit
that
should
have
completed
his
provisions
so
conseil
asked
you
have
everything
you
need
ned
my
friend
humph
the
canadian
put
in
what
youre
complaining
all
this
vegetation
doesnt
make
a
meal
ned
replied
just
side
dishes
dessert
but
wheres
the
soup
course
wheres
the
roast
right
i
said
ned
promised
us
cutlets
which
seems
highly
questionable
to
me
sir
the
canadian
replied
our
hunting
not
only
isnt
over
it
hasnt
even
started
patience
were
sure
to
end
up
bumping
into
some
animal
with
either
feathers
or
fur
if
not
in
this
locality
then
in
another
and
if
not
today
then
tomorrow
because
we
mustnt
wander
too
far
off
conseil
added
thats
why
i
propose
that
we
return
to
the
skiff
what
already
ned
exclaimed
we
ought
to
be
back
before
nightfall
i
said
but
what
hour
is
it
then
the
canadian
asked
two
oclock
at
least
conseil
replied
how
time
flies
on
solid
ground
exclaimed
mr
ned
land
with
a
sigh
of
regret
off
we
go
conseil
replied
so
we
returned
through
the
forest
and
we
completed
our
harvest
by
making
a
clean
sweep
of
some
palm
cabbages
that
had
to
be
picked
from
the
crowns
of
their
trees
some
small
beans
that
i
recognized
as
the
abrou
of
the
malaysians
and
some
highquality
yams
we
were
overloaded
when
we
arrived
at
the
skiff
however
ned
land
still
found
these
provisions
inadequate
but
fortune
smiled
on
him
just
as
we
were
boarding
he
spotted
several
trees
twentyfive
to
thirty
feet
high
belonging
to
the
palm
species
as
valuable
as
the
artocarpus
these
trees
are
justly
ranked
among
the
most
useful
produce
in
malaysia
they
were
sago
palms
vegetation
that
grows
without
being
cultivated
like
mulberry
trees
they
reproduce
by
means
of
shoots
and
seeds
ned
land
knew
how
to
handle
these
trees
taking
his
ax
and
wielding
it
with
great
vigor
he
soon
stretched
out
on
the
ground
two
or
three
sago
palms
whose
maturity
was
revealed
by
the
white
dust
sprinkled
over
their
palm
fronds
i
watched
him
more
as
a
naturalist
than
as
a
man
in
hunger
he
began
by
removing
from
each
trunk
an
inchthick
strip
of
bark
that
covered
a
network
of
long
hopelessly
tangled
fibers
that
were
puttied
with
a
sort
of
gummy
flour
this
flour
was
the
starchlike
sago
an
edible
substance
chiefly
consumed
by
the
melanesian
peoples
for
the
time
being
ned
land
was
content
to
chop
these
trunks
into
pieces
as
if
he
were
making
firewood
later
he
would
extract
the
flour
by
sifting
it
through
cloth
to
separate
it
from
its
fibrous
ligaments
let
it
dry
out
in
the
sun
and
leave
it
to
harden
inside
molds
finally
at
five
oclock
in
the
afternoon
laden
with
all
our
treasures
we
left
the
island
beach
and
half
an
hour
later
pulled
alongside
the
nautilus
nobody
appeared
on
our
arrival
the
enormous
sheetiron
cylinder
seemed
deserted
our
provisions
loaded
on
board
i
went
below
to
my
stateroom
there
i
found
my
supper
ready
i
ate
and
then
fell
asleep
the
next
day
january
6
nothing
new
on
board
not
a
sound
inside
not
a
sign
of
life
the
skiff
stayed
alongside
in
the
same
place
we
had
left
it
we
decided
to
return
to
gueboroa
island
ned
land
hoped
for
better
luck
in
his
hunting
than
on
the
day
before
and
he
wanted
to
visit
a
different
part
of
the
forest
by
sunrise
we
were
off
carried
by
an
inbound
current
the
longboat
reached
the
island
in
a
matter
of
moments
we
disembarked
and
thinking
it
best
to
abide
by
the
canadians
instincts
we
followed
ned
land
whose
long
legs
threatened
to
outpace
us
ned
land
went
westward
up
the
coast
then
fording
some
stream
beds
he
reached
open
plains
that
were
bordered
by
wonderful
forests
some
kingfishers
lurked
along
the
watercourses
but
they
didnt
let
us
approach
their
cautious
behavior
proved
to
me
that
these
winged
creatures
knew
where
they
stood
on
bipeds
of
our
species
and
i
concluded
that
if
this
island
wasnt
inhabited
at
least
human
beings
paid
it
frequent
visits
after
crossing
a
pretty
lush
prairie
we
arrived
on
the
outskirts
of
a
small
wood
enlivened
by
the
singing
and
soaring
of
a
large
number
of
birds
still
theyre
merely
birds
conseil
said
but
some
are
edible
the
harpooner
replied
wrong
ned
my
friend
conseil
answered
because
i
see
only
ordinary
parrots
here
conseil
my
friend
ned
replied
in
all
seriousness
parrots
are
like
pheasant
to
people
with
nothing
else
on
their
plates
and
i
might
add
i
said
that
when
these
birds
are
properly
cooked
theyre
at
least
worth
a
stab
of
the
fork
indeed
under
the
dense
foliage
of
this
wood
a
whole
host
of
parrots
fluttered
from
branch
to
branch
needing
only
the
proper
upbringing
to
speak
human
dialects
at
present
they
were
cackling
in
chorus
with
parakeets
of
every
color
with
solemn
cockatoos
that
seemed
to
be
pondering
some
philosophical
problem
while
bright
red
lories
passed
by
like
pieces
of
bunting
borne
on
the
breeze
in
the
midst
of
kalao
parrots
raucously
on
the
wing
papuan
lories
painted
the
subtlest
shades
of
azure
and
a
whole
variety
of
delightful
winged
creatures
none
terribly
edible
however
one
bird
unique
to
these
shores
which
never
passes
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
aru
and
papuan
islands
was
missing
from
this
collection
but
i
was
given
a
chance
to
marvel
at
it
soon
enough
after
crossing
through
a
moderately
dense
thicket
we
again
found
some
plains
obstructed
by
bushes
there
i
saw
some
magnificent
birds
soaring
aloft
the
arrangement
of
their
long
feathers
causing
them
to
head
into
the
wind
their
undulating
flight
the
grace
of
their
aerial
curves
and
the
play
of
their
colors
allured
and
delighted
the
eye
i
had
no
trouble
identifying
them
birds
of
paradise
i

i
doubt
it
mr

nevertheless
im
counting
on
your
dexterity
to
catch
me
one
of
these
delightful
representatives

tropical
nature
ill
give
it
a

malaysians
who
do
a
booming
business
in
these
birds
with
the
chinese
have
various
methods
for
catching
them
that
we
couldnt
use
sometimes
they
set
snares
on
the
tops
of
the
tall
trees
that
the
bird
of
paradise
prefers
to
inhabit
at
other
times
they
capture
it
with
a
tenacious
glue
that
paralyzes
its
movements
they
will
even
go
so
far
as
to
poison
the
springs
where
these
fowl
habitually
drink
but
in
our
case
all
we
could
do
was
fire
at
them
on
the
wing
which
left
us
little
chance
of
getting
one
and
in
truth
we
used
up
a
good
part
of
our
ammunition
in
vain
near
eleven
oclock
in
the
morning
we
cleared
the
lower
slopes
of
the
mountains
that
form
the
islands
center
and
we
still
hadnt
bagged
a

hunger
spurred
us
on
the
hunters
had
counted
on
consuming
the
proceeds
of
their
hunting

they
had
miscalculated
luckily
and
much
to
his
surprise
conseil
pulled
off
a
rightandleft

and
insured
our
breakfast
he
brought
down
a
white
pigeon
and
a
ringdove
which
were
briskly
plucked
hung
from
a

roasted
over

of
deadwood
while
these

animals
were

prepared
some

the

all
right
ned
i
asked
the
canadian
now
what
do
you
need
game
with
four
paws
professor
aronnax
ned
land
replied
all
these
pigeons
are
only
appetizers
snacks
so
till
ive
bagged
an
animal
with
cutlets
i
wont
be
happy
nor
i
ned
until
ive
caught
a
bird
of
paradise
then
lets
keep
hunting
conseil
replied
but
while
heading
back
to
the
sea
weve
arrived
at
the
foothills
of
these
mountains
and
i
think
well
do
better
if
we
return
to
the
forest
regions
it
was
good
advice
and
we
took
it
after
an
hours
walk
we
reached
a
genuine
sago
palm
forest
a
few
harmless
snakes
fled
underfoot
birds
of
paradise
stole
off
at
our
approach
and
i
was
in
real
despair
of
catching
one
when
conseil
walking
in
the
lead
stooped
suddenly
gave
a
triumphant
shout
and
came
back
to
me
carrying
a
magnificent
bird
of
paradise
oh
bravo
conseil
i
exclaimed
master
is
too
kind
conseil
replied
not
at
all
my
boy
that
was
a
stroke
of
genius
catching
one
of
these
live
birds
with
your
bare
hands
if
master
will
examine
it
closely
hell
see
that
i
deserve
no
great
praise
and
why
not
conseil
because
this
bird
is
as
drunk
as
a
lord
drunk
yes
master
drunk
from
the
nutmegs
it
was
devouring
under
that
nutmeg
tree
where
i
caught
it
see
ned
my
friend
see
the
monstrous
results
of
intemperance
damnation
the
canadian
shot
back
considering
the
amount
of
gin
ive
had
these
past
two
months
youve
got
nothing
to
complain
about
meanwhile
i
was
examining
this
unusual
bird
conseil
was
not
mistaken
tipsy
from
that
potent
juice
our
bird
of
paradise
had
been
reduced
to
helplessness
it
was
unable
to
fly
it
was
barely
able
to
walk
but
this
didnt
alarm
me
and
i
just
let
it
sleep
off
its
nutmeg
this
bird
belonged
to
the
finest
of
the
eight
species
credited
to
papua
and
its
neighboring
islands
it
was
a
great
emerald
one
of
the
rarest
birds
of
paradise
it
measured
three
decimeters
long
its
head
was
comparatively
small
and
its
eyes
placed
near
the
opening
of
its
beak
were
also
small
but
it
offered
a
wonderful
mixture
of
hues
a
yellow
beak
brown
feet
and
claws
hazel
wings
with
purple
tips
pale
yellow
head
and
scruff
of
the
neck
emerald
throat
the
belly
and
chest
maroon
to
brown
two
strands
made
of
a
horn
substance
covered
with
down
rose
over
its
tail
which
was
lengthened
by
long
very
light
feathers
of
wonderful
fineness
and
they
completed
the
costume
of
this
marvelous
bird
that
the
islanders
have
poetically
named
the
sun
bird
how
i
wished
i
could
take
this
superb
bird
of
paradise
back
to
paris
to
make
a
gift
of
it
to
the
zoo
at
the
botanical
gardens
which
doesnt
own
a
single
live
specimen
so
it
must
be
a
rarity
or
something
the
canadian
asked
in
the
tone
of
a
hunter
who
from
the
viewpoint
of
his
art
gives
the
game
a
pretty
low
rating
a
great
rarity
my
gallant
comrade
and
above
all
very
hard
to
capture
alive
and
even
after
theyre
dead
theres
still
a
major
market
for
these
birds
so
the
natives
have
figured
out
how
to
create
fake
ones
like
people
create
fake
pearls
or
diamonds
what
conseil
exclaimed
they
make
counterfeit
birds
of
paradise
yes
conseil
and
is
master
familiar
with
how
the
islanders
go
about
it
perfectly
familiar
during
the
easterly
monsoon
season
birds
of
paradise
lose
the
magnificent
feathers
around
their
tails
that
naturalists
call
belowthewing
feathers
these
feathers
are
gathered
by
the
fowl
forgers
and
skillfully
fitted
onto
some
poor
previously
mutilated
parakeet
then
they
paint
over
the
suture
varnish
the
bird
and
ship
the
fruits
of
their
unique
labors
to
museums
and
collectors
in
europe
good
enough
ned
land
put
in
if
it
isnt
the
right
bird
its
still
the
right
feathers
and
so
long
as
the
merchandise
isnt
meant
to
be
eaten
i
see
no
great
harm
but
if
my
desires
were
fulfilled
by
the
capture
of
this
bird
of
paradise
those
of
our
canadian
huntsman
remained
unsatisfied
luckily
near
two
oclock
ned
land
brought
down
a
magnificent
wild
pig
of
the
type
the
natives
call
barioutang
this
animal
came
in
the
nick
of
time
for
us
to
bag
some
real
quadruped
meat
and
it
was
warmly
welcomed
ned
land
proved
himself
quite
gloriously
with
his
gunshot
hit
by
an
electric
bullet
the
pig
dropped
dead
on
the
spot
the
canadian
properly
skinned
and
cleaned
it
after
removing
half
a
dozen
cutlets
destined
to
serve
as
the
grilled
meat
course
of
our
evening
meal
then
the
hunt
was
on
again
and
once
more
would
be
marked
by
the
exploits
of
ned
and
conseil
in
essence
beating
the
bushes
the
two
friends
flushed
a
herd
of
kangaroos
that
fled
by
bounding
away
on
their
elastic
paws
but
these
animals
didnt
flee
so
swiftly
that
our
electric
capsules
couldnt
catch
up
with
them
oh
professor
shouted
ned
land
whose
hunting
fever
had
gone
to
his
brain
what
excellent
game
especially
in
a
stew
what
a
supply
for
the
nautilus
two
three
five
down
and
just
think
how
well
devour
all
this
meat
ourselves
while
those
numbskulls
on
board
wont
get
a
shred
in
his
uncontrollable
glee
i
think
the
canadian
might
have
slaughtered
the
whole
horde
if
he
hadnt
been
so
busy
talking
but
he
was
content
with
a
dozen
of
these
fascinating
marsupials
which
make
up
the
first
order
of
aplacental
mammals
as
conseil
just
had
to
tell
us
these
animals
were
small
in
stature
they
were
a
species
of
those
rabbit
kangaroos
that
usually
dwell
in
the
hollows
of
trees
and
are
tremendously
fast
but
although
of
moderate
dimensions
they
at
least
furnish
a
meat
thats
highly
prized
we
were
thoroughly
satisfied
with
the
results
of
our
hunting
a
gleeful
ned
proposed
that
we
return
the
next
day
to
this
magic
island
which
he
planned
to
depopulate
of
its
every
edible
quadruped
but
he
was
reckoning
without
events
by
six
oclock
in
the
evening
we
were
back
on
the
beach
the
skiff
was
aground
in
its
usual
place
the
nautilus
looking
like
a
long
reef
emerged
from
the
waves
two
miles
offshore
without
further
ado
ned
land
got
down
to
the
important
business
of
dinner
he
came
wonderfully
to
terms
with
its
entire
cooking
grilling
over
the
coals
those
cutlets
from
the
barioutang
soon
gave
off
a
succulent
aroma
that
perfumed
the
air
but
i
catch
myself
following
in
the
canadians
footsteps
look
at
mein
ecstasy
over
freshly
grilled
pork
please
grant
me
a
pardon
as
ive
already
granted
one

half
a
dozen
pineapples
and
the
fermented
liquor
from
certain
coconuts
heightened
our
glee
i
suspect
that
my
two
fine
companions
werent
quite
as
clearheaded
as
one
could
wish
what
if
we
dont

i
said
moving
toward
the
sea
indeed
it
was
essential
to
beat
a
retreat
because
some
twenty
natives
armed
with
bows
and
slings
appeared
barely
a
hundred
paces
off
on
the
outskirts
of
a
thicket
that
masked
the
horizon
to
our
right
the
skiff
was
aground
ten
fathoms
away
from
us
the
savages
approached
without
running
but
they
favored
us
with
a
show
of
the
greatest
hostility
it
was
raining
stones
and
arrows
ned
land
was
unwilling
to
leave
his
provisions
behind
and
despite
the
impending
danger
he
clutched
his
pig
on
one
side
his
kangaroos
on
the
other
and
scampered
off
with
respectable
speed
in
two
minutes
we
were
on
the
strand
loading
provisions
and
weapons
into
the
skiff
pushing
it
to
sea
and
positioning
its
two
oars
were
the
work
of
an
instant
we
hadnt
gone
two
cable
lengths
when
a
hundred
savages
howling
and
gesticulating
entered
the
water
up
to
their
waists
i
looked
to
see
if
their
appearance
might
draw
some
of
the
nautiluss
men
onto
the
platform
but
no
lying
well
out
that
enormous
machine
still
seemed
completely
deserted
twenty
minutes
later
we
boarded
ship
the
hatches
were
open
after
mooring
the
skiff
we
reentered
the
nautiluss
interior
i
went
below
to
the
lounge
from
which
some
chords
were
wafting
captain
nemo
was
there
leaning
over
the
organ
deep
in
a
musical
trance
captain
i
said
to
him
he
didnt
hear
me
captain
i
went
on
touching
him
with
my
hand
he
trembled
and
turning
around
ah
its
you
professor
he
said
to
me
well
did
you
have
a
happy
hunt
was
your
herb
gathering
a
success
yes
captain
i
replied
but
unfortunately
weve
brought
back
a
horde
of
bipeds
whose
proximity
worries
me
what
sort
of
bipeds
savages
savages
captain
nemo
replied
in
an
ironic
tone
you
set
foot
on
one
of
the
shores
of
this
globe
professor
and
youre
surprised
to
find
savages
there
where
arent
there
savages
and
besides
are
they
any
worse
than
men
elsewhere
these
people
you
call
savages
but
captain
speaking
for
myself
sir
ive
encountered
them
everywhere
well
then
i
replied
if
you
dont
want
to
welcome
them
aboard
the
nautilus
youd
better
take
some
precautions
easy
professor
no
cause
for
alarm
but
there
are
a
large
number
of
these
natives
whats
your
count
at
least
a
hundred
professor
aronnax
replied
captain
nemo
whose
fingers
took
their
places
again
on
the
organ
keys
if
every
islander
in
papua
were
to
gather
on
that
beach
the
nautilus
would
still
have
nothing
to
fear
from
their
attacks
the
captains
fingers
then
ran
over
the
instruments
keyboard
and
i
noticed
that
he
touched
only
its
black
keys
which
gave
his
melodies
a
basically
scottish
color
soon
he
had
forgotten
my
presence
and
was
lost
in
a
reverie
that
i
no
longer
tried
to
dispel
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
night
had
already
fallen
because
in
this
low
latitude
the
sun
sets
quickly
without
any
twilight
i
could
see
gueboroa
island
only
dimly
but
numerous
fires
had
been
kindled
on
the
beach
attesting
that
the
natives
had
no
thoughts
of
leaving
it
for
several
hours
i
was
left
to
myself
sometimes
musing
on
the
islandersbut
no
longer
fearing
them
because
the
captains
unflappable
confidence
had
won
me
overand
sometimes
forgetting
them
to
marvel
at
the
splendors
of
this
tropical
night
my
memories
took
wing
toward
france
in
the
wake
of
those
zodiacal
stars
due
to
twinkle
over
it
in
a
few
hours
the
moon
shone
in
the
midst
of
the
constellations
at
their
zenith
i
then
remembered
that
this
loyal
goodnatured
satellite
would
return
to
this
same
place
the
day
after
tomorrow
to
raise
the
tide
and
tear
the
nautilus
from
its
coral
bed
near
midnight
seeing
that
all
was
quiet
over
the
darkened
waves
as
well
as
under
the
waterside
trees
i
repaired
to
my
cabin
and
fell
into
a
peaceful
sleep
the
night
passed
without
mishap
no
doubt
the
papuans
had
been
frightened
off
by
the
mere
sight
of
this
monster
aground
in
the
bay
because
our
hatches
stayed
open
offering
easy
access
to
the
nautiluss
interior
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
january
8
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
the
morning
shadows
were
lifting
the
island
was
soon
on
view
through
the
dissolving
mists
first
its
beaches
then
its
summits
the
islanders
were
still
there
in
greater
numbers
than
on
the
day
before
perhaps
500
or
600
of
them
taking
advantage
of
the
low
tide
some
of
them
had
moved
forward
over
the
heads
of
coral
to
within
two
cable
lengths
of
the
nautilus
i
could
easily
distinguish
them
they
obviously
were
true
papuans
men
of
fine
stock
athletic
in
build
forehead
high
and
broad
nose
large
but
not
flat
teeth
white
their
woolly
redtinted
hair
was
in
sharp
contrast
to
their
bodies
which
were
black
and
glistening
like
those
of
nubians
beneath
their
pierced
distended
earlobes
there
dangled
strings
of
beads
made
from
bone
generally
these
savages
were
naked
i
noted
some
women
among
them
dressed
from
hip
to
knee
in
grass
skirts
held
up
by
belts
made
of
vegetation
some
of
the
chieftains
adorned
their
necks
with
crescents
and
with
necklaces
made
from
beads
of
red
and
white
glass
armed
with
bows
arrows
and
shields
nearly
all
of
them
carried
from
their
shoulders
a
sort
of
net
which
held
those
polished
stones
their
slings
hurl
with
such
dexterity
one
of
these
chieftains
came
fairly
close
to
the
nautilus
examining
it
with
care
he
must
have
been
a
mado
of
high
rank
because
he
paraded
in
a
mat
of
banana
leaves
that
had
ragged
edges
and
was
accented
with
bright
colors
i
could
easily
have
picked
off
this
islander
he
stood
at
such
close
range
but
i
thought
it
best
to
wait
for
an
actual
show
of
hostility
between
europeans
and
savages
its
acceptable
for
europeans
to
shoot
back
but
not
to
attack
first
during
this
whole
time
of
low
tide
the
islanders
lurked
near
the
nautilus
but
they
werent
boisterous
i
often
heard
them
repeat
the
word
assai
and
from
their
gestures
i
understood
they
were
inviting
me
to
go
ashore
an
invitation
i
felt
obliged
to
decline
so
the
skiff
didnt
leave
shipside
that
day
much
to
the
displeasure
of
mr
land
who
couldnt
complete
his
provisions
the
adroit
canadian
spent
his
time
preparing
the
meat
and
flour
products
he
had
brought
from
gueboroa
island
as
for
the
savages
they
went
back
to
shore
near
eleven
oclock
in
the
morning
when
the
heads
of
coral
began
to
disappear
under
the
waves
of
the
rising
tide
but
i
saw
their
numbers
swell
considerably
on
the
beach
it
was
likely
that
they
had
come
from
neighboring
islands
or
from
the
mainland
of
papua
proper
however
i
didnt
see
one
local
dugout
canoe
having
nothing
better
to
do
i
decided
to
dredge
these
beautiful
clear
waters
which
exhibited
a
profusion
of
shells
zoophytes
and
opensea
plants
besides
it
was
the
last
day
the
nautilus
would
spend
in
these
waterways
if
tomorrow
it
still
floated
off
to
the
open
sea
as
captain
nemo
had
promised
so
i
summoned
conseil
who
brought
me
a
small
light
dragnet
similar
to
those
used
in
oyster
fishing
what
about
these
savages
conseil
asked
me
with
all
due
respect
to
master
they
dont
strike
me
as
very
wicked
theyre
cannibals
even
so
my
boy
a
person
can
be
both
a
cannibal
and
a
decent
man
conseil
replied
just
as
a
person
can
be
both
gluttonous
and
honorable
the
one
doesnt
exclude
the
other
fine
conseil
and
i
agree
that
there
are
honorable
cannibals
who
decently
devour
their
prisoners
however
im
opposed
to
being
devoured
even
in
all
decency
so
ill
keep
on
my
guard
especially
since
the
nautiluss
commander
seems
to
be
taking
no
precautions
and
now
lets
get
to
work
for
two
hours
our
fishing
proceeded
energetically
but
without
bringing
up
any
rarities
our
dragnet
was
filled
with
midas
abalone
harp
shells
obelisk
snails
and
especially
the
finest
hammer
shells
i
had
seen
to
that
day
we
also
gathered
in
a
few
sea
cucumbers
some
pearl
oysters
and
a
dozen
small
turtles
that
we
saved
for
the
ships
pantry
but
just
when
i
least
expected
it
i
laid
my
hands
on
a
wonder
a
natural
deformity
id
have
to
call
it
something
very
seldom
encountered
conseil
had
just
made
a
cast
of
the
dragnet
and
his
gear
had
come
back
up
loaded
with
a
variety
of
fairly
ordinary
seashells
when
suddenly
he
saw
me
plunge
my
arms
swiftly
into
the
net
pull
out
a
shelled
animal
and
give
a
conchological
yell
in
other
words
the
most
piercing
yell
a
human
throat
can
produce
eh
what
happened
to
master
conseil
asked
very
startled
did
master
get
bitten
no
my
boy
but
id
gladly
have
sacrificed
a
finger
for
such
a
find
what
find
this
shell
i
said
displaying
the
subject
of
my
triumph
but
thats
simply
an
olive
shell
of
the
tent
olive
species
genus
oliva
order
pectinibranchia
class
gastropoda
branch
mollusca
yes
yes
conseil
but
instead
of
coiling
from
right
to
left
this
olive
shell
rolls
from
left
to
right
it
cant
be
conseil
exclaimed
yes
my
boy
its
a
lefthanded
shell
a
lefthanded
shell
conseil
repeated
his
heart
pounding
look
at
its
spiral
oh
master
can
trust
me
on
this
conseil
said
taking
the
valuable
shell
in
trembling
hands
but
never
have
i
felt
such
excitement
and
there
was
good
reason
to
be
excited
in
fact
as
naturalists
have
ventured
to
observe
dextrality
is
a
wellknown
law
of
nature
in
their
rotational
and
orbital
movements
stars
and
their
satellites
go
from
right
to
left
man
uses
his
right
hand
more
often
than
his
left
and
consequently
his
various
instruments
and
equipment
staircases
locks
watch
springs
etc
are
designed
to
be
used
in
a
righttoleft
manner
now
then
nature
has
generally
obeyed
this
law
in
coiling
her
shells
theyre
righthanded
with
only
rare
exceptions
and
when
by
chance
a
shells
spiral
is
lefthanded
collectors
will
pay
its
weight
in
gold
for
it
so
conseil
and
i
were
deep
in
the
contemplation
of
our
treasure
and
i
was
solemnly
promising
myself
to
enrich
the
paris
museum
with
it
when
an
illtimed
stone
hurled
by
one
of
the
islanders
whizzed
over
and
shattered
the
valuable
object
in
conseils
hands
i
gave
a
yell
of
despair
conseil
pounced
on
his
rifle
and
aimed
at
a
savage
swinging
a
sling
just
ten
meters
away
from
him
i
tried
to
stop
him
but
his
shot
went
off
and
shattered
a
bracelet
of
amulets
dangling
from
the
islanders
arm
conseil
i
shouted
conseil
eh
what
didnt
master
see
that
this
maneater
initiated
the
attack
a
shell
isnt
worth
a
human
life
i
told
him
oh
the
rascal
conseil
exclaimed
id
rather
he
cracked
my
shoulder
conseil
was
in
dead
earnest
but
i
didnt
subscribe
to
his
views
however
the
situation
had
changed
in
only
a
short
time
and
we
hadnt
noticed
now
some
twenty
dugout
canoes
were
surrounding
the
nautilus
hollowed
from
tree
trunks
these
dugouts
were
long
narrow
and
well
designed
for
speed
keeping
their
balance
by
means
of
two
bamboo
poles
that
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
water
they
were
maneuvered
by
skillful
halfnaked
paddlers
and
i
viewed
their
advance
with
definite
alarm
it
was
obvious
these
papuans
had
already
entered
into
relations
with
europeans
and
knew
their
ships
but
this
long
iron
cylinder
lying
in
the
bay
with
no
masts
or
funnelswhat
were
they
to
make
of
it
nothing
good
because
at
first
they
kept
it
at
a
respectful
distance
however
seeing
that
it
stayed
motionless
they
regained
confidence
little
by
little
and
tried
to
become
more
familiar
with
it
now
then
it
was
precisely
this
familiarity
that
we
needed
to
prevent
since
our
weapons
made
no
sound
when
they
went
off
they
would
have
only
a
moderate
effect
on
these
islanders
who
reputedly
respect
nothing
but
noisy
mechanisms
without
thunderclaps
lightning
bolts
would
be
much
less
frightening
although
the
danger
lies
in
the
flash
not
the
noise
just
then
the
dugout
canoes
drew
nearer
to
the
nautilus
and
a
cloud
of
arrows
burst
over
us
fire
and
brimstone
its
hailing
conseil
said
and
poisoned
hail
perhaps
weve
got
to
alert
captain
nemo
i
said
reentering
the
hatch
i
went
below
to
the
lounge
i
found
no
one
there
i
ventured
a
knock
at
the
door
opening
into
the
captains
stateroom
the
word
enter
answered
me
i
did
so
and
found
captain
nemo
busy
with
calculations
in
which
there
was
no
shortage
of
x
and
other
algebraic
signs
am
i
disturbing
you
i
said
out
of
politeness
correct
professor
aronnax
the
captain
answered
me
but
i
imagine
you
have
pressing
reasons
for
looking
me
up
very
pressing
native
dugout
canoes
are
surrounding
us
and
in
a
few
minutes
were
sure
to
be
assaulted
by
several
hundred
savages
ah
captain
nemo
put
in
serenely
theyve
come
in
their
dugouts
yes
sir
well
sir
closing
the
hatches
should
do
the
trick
precisely
and
thats
what
i
came
to
tell
you
nothing
easier
captain
nemo
said
and
he
pressed
an
electric
button
transmitting
an
order
to
the
crews
quarters
there
sir
all
under
control
he
told
me
after
a
few
moments
the
skiff
is
in
place
and
the
hatches
are
closed
i
dont
imagine
youre
worried
that
these
gentlemen
will
stave
in
walls
that
shells
from
your
frigate
couldnt
breach
no
captain
but
one
danger
still
remains
whats
that
sir
tomorrow
at
about
this
time
well
need
to
reopen
the
hatches
to
renew
the
nautiluss
air
no
argument
sir
since
our
craft
breathes
in
the
manner
favored
by
cetaceans
but
if
these
papuans
are
occupying
the
platform
at
that
moment
i
dont
see
how
you
can
prevent
them
from
entering
then
sir
you
assume
theyll
board
the
ship
im
certain
of
it
well
sir
let
them
come
aboard
i
see
no
reason
to
prevent
them
deep
down
theyre
just
poor
devils
these
papuans
and
i
dont
want
my
visit
to
gueboroa
island
to
cost
the
life
of
a
single
one
of
these
unfortunate
people
on
this
note
i
was
about
to
withdraw
but
captain
nemo
detained
me
and
invited
me
to
take
a
seat
next
to
him
he
questioned
me
with
interest
on
our
excursions
ashore
and
on
our
hunting
but
seemed
not
to
understand
the
canadians
passionate
craving
for
red
meat
then
our
conversation
skimmed
various
subjects
and
without
being
more
forthcoming
captain
nemo
proved
more
affable
among
other
things
we
came
to
talk
of
the
nautiluss
circumstances
aground
in
the
same
strait
where
captain
dumont
durville
had
nearly
miscarried
then
pertinent
to
this
he
was
one
of
your
great
seamen
the
captain
told
me
one
of
your
shrewdest
navigators
that
durville
he
was
the
frenchmans
captain
cook
a
man
wise
but
unlucky
braving
the
ice
banks
of
the
south
pole
the
coral
of
oceania
the
cannibals
of
the
pacific
only
to
perish
wretchedly
in
a
train
wreck
if
that
energetic
man
was
able
to
think
about
his
life
in
its
last
seconds
imagine
what
his
final
thoughts
must
have
been
as
he
spoke
captain
nemo
seemed
deeply
moved
an
emotion
i
felt
was
to
his
credit
then
chart
in
hand
we
returned
to
the
deeds
of
the
french
navigator
his
voyages
to
circumnavigate
the
globe
his
double
attempt
at
the
south
pole
which
led
to
his
discovery
of
the
adlie
coast
and
the
louisphilippe
peninsula
finally
his
hydrographic
surveys
of
the
chief
islands
in
oceania
what
your
durville
did
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
captain
nemo
told
me
ive
done
in
the
oceans
interior
but
more
easily
more
completely
than
he
constantly
tossed
about
by
hurricanes
the
zealous
and
the
new
astrolabe
couldnt
compare
with
the
nautilus
a
quiet
work
room
truly
at
rest
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
even
so
captain
i
said
there
is
one
major
similarity
between
dumont
durvilles
sloops
of
war
and
the
nautilus
whats
that
sir
like
them
the
nautilus
has
run
aground
the
nautilus
is
not
aground
sir
captain
nemo
replied
icily
the
nautilus
was
built
to
rest
on
the
ocean
floor
and
i
dont
need
to
undertake
the
arduous
labors

said
i
dont
doubt
tomorrow
captain
nemo
added
standing
up
tomorrow
at
240
in
the
afternoon
the
nautilus
will
float
off
and
exit
the

undamaged
pronouncing
these
words
in
an
extremely
sharp
tone
captain
nemo
gave
me
a
curt
bow
this
was
my
dismissal
and
i
reentered
my
stateroom
there
i
found
conseil
who
wanted
to
know
the
upshot
of
my
interview
with
the
captain
my
boy
i
replied
when
i
expressed
the
belief
that
these
papuan
natives
were
a
threat
to
his
nautilus
the
captain
answered
me
with
great
irony
so
ive
just
one
thing
to
say
to
you
have
faith
in
him
and
sleep
in
peace

replied
but
our

concocting
a

that
will
be
the
eighth
wonder
i
was
left
to
myself
i
went
to
bed
but
slept
pretty
poorly
i
kept
hearing
noises
from
the
savages
who
were
stamping
on
the
platform
and
letting
out
deafening
yells
the
night
passed
in
this
way
without
the
crew
ever
emerging
from
their
usual
inertia
they
were
no
more
disturbed
by
the
presence
of
these
maneaters
than
soldiers
in
an
armored
fortress
are
troubled
by
ants
running
over
the
armor
plate
i
got
up
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
the
hatches
werent
open
so
the
air
inside
hadnt
been
renewed
but
the
air
tanks
were
kept
full
for
any
eventuality
and
would
function
appropriately
to
shoot
a
few
cubic
meters
of
oxygen
into
the
nautiluss
thin
atmosphere
i
worked
in
my
stateroom
until
noon
without
seeing
captain
nemo
even
for
an
instant
nobody
on
board
seemed
to
be
making
any
preparations
for
departure
i
still
waited
for
a
while
then
i
made
my
way
to
the
main
lounge
its
timepiece
marked
230
in
ten
minutes
the
tide
would
reach
its
maximum
elevation
and
if
captain
nemo
hadnt
made
a
rash
promise
the
nautilus
would
immediately
break
free
if
not
many
months
might
pass
before
it
could
leave
its
coral
bed
but
some
preliminary
vibrations
could
soon
be
felt
over
the
boats
hull
i
heard
its
plating
grind
against
the
limestone
roughness
of
that
coral
base
at
235
captain
nemo
appeared
in
the
lounge
were
about
to
depart
he
said
ah
i
put
in
ive
given
orders
to
open
the
hatches
what
about
the
papuans
what
about
them
captain
nemo
replied
with
a
light
shrug
of
his
shoulders
wont
they
come
inside
the
nautilus
how
will
they
manage
that
by
jumping
down
the
hatches
youre
about

captain

replied
serenely
the
nautiluss
hatches
arent

in
that
fashion
even
when
theyre
open
i
gaped
at
the

you

he
said
to
me
not
in
the

youll

i
headed
to
the

there
very
puzzled

and
conseil
watched
the

opening
the

while
a
frightful
clamor
and
furious
shouts
resounded
outside
the
hatch
lids
fell
back
onto
the
outer

twenty
horrible
faces
appeared
but
when
the
first
islander
laid
hands
on
the
companionway
railing
he
was
flung
backward
by
some
invisible
power
lord

what
he
ran
off
howling
in
terror
and

around

followed
him
all

the

conseil
was
in
ecstasy
carried
away
by
his
violent
instincts
ned

leaped
up
the
companionway
but
as
soon
as
his
hands
seized
the

he
was
thrown
backward
in
his
turn
damnation
he
exclaimed
ive
been
struck
by
a
lightning
bolt
these
words
explained
everything
to
me
it
wasnt
just
a
railing
that
led
to
the
platform
it
was
a
metal

fully
charged
with

anyone
who
touched
it
got
a
fearsome
shockand
such
a
shock
would
have
been
fatal
if
captain
nemo
had
thrown
the
full
current
from
his
equipment
into
this
conducting
cable
it
could
honestly
be
said
that
he
had
stretched
between
himself
and
his
assailants
a
network
of
electricity
no
one
could
clear
with
impunity
meanwhile
crazed
with
terror
the
unhinged
papuans
beat
a
retreat
as
for
us
half
laughing
we
massaged
and
comforted
poor
ned

who
was
swearing
like
one
possessed
but
just
then
lifted
off
by
the
tides
final

the
nautilus
left
its
coral

at
exactly
that
fortieth

pinpointed
by
the

its

churned
the

majesty

the

on
the

the
nautilus
resumed
its
travels
in
midwater
but
at
a
remarkable
speed
that
i
estimated
to
be
at

thirtyfive
miles
per
hour
the
propeller
was
going
so
fast
i
could
neither
follow
nor
count
its
revolutions
i
thought
about
how
this
marvelous
electric
force
not
only
gave
motion
heat
and
light
to
the
nautilus
but
even
protected
it
against
outside
attack
transforming
it
into
a
sacred
ark
no

could
touch
without
being

my
wonderment
was

and
it
went
from
the

the

had

the
nautilus
slowed
down
in
an
odd
manner
and
very
unpredictable
in
its
ways
it
sometimes
swam
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
sometimes
drifted
on
their
surface
during
this
phase
of
our
voyage
captain
nemo
conducted
interesting
experiments
on
the
different
temperatures
in
various
strata
of
the
sea
under
ordinary
conditions
such
readings
are
obtained
using
some
pretty
complicated
instruments
whose
findings
are
dubious
to
say
the
least
whether
theyre
thermometric
sounding
lines
whose
glass
often
shatters
under
the
waters
pressure
or
those
devices
based
on
the
varying
resistance
of
metals
to
electric
currents
the
results
so
obtained
cant
be
adequately
doublechecked
by
contrast
captain
nemo
would
seek
the
seas
temperature
by
going
himself
into
its
depths
and
when
he
placed
his
thermometer
in
contact
with
the
various
layers
of
liquid
he
found
the
soughtfor
degree
immediately
and
with
certainty
and
so
by
loading
up
its
ballast
tanks
or
by
sinking
obliquely
with
its
slanting
fins
the
nautilus
successively
reached
depths
of
3000
4000
5000
7000
9000
and
10000
meters
and
the
ultimate
conclusion
from
these
experiments
was
that
in
all
latitudes
the
sea
had
a
permanent
temperature
of
45
degrees
centigrade
at
a
depth
of
1000
meters
i
watched
these
experiments
with
the
most
intense
fascination
captain
nemo
brought
a
real
passion
to
them
i
often
wondered
why
he
took
these
observations
were
they
for
the
benefit
of
his
fellow
man
it
was
unlikely
because
sooner
or
later
his
work
would
perish
with
him
in
some
unknown
sea
unless
he
intended
the
results
of
his
experiments
for
me
but
that
meant
this
strange
voyage
of
mine
would
come
to
an
end
and
no
such
end
was
in
sight
be
that
as
it
may
captain
nemo
also
introduced
me
to
the
different
data
he
had
obtained
on
the
relative
densities
of
the
water
in
our
globes
chief
seas
from
this
news
i
derived
some
personal
enlightenment
having
nothing
to
do
with
science
it
happened
the
morning
of
january
15
the
captain
with
whom
i
was
strolling
on
the
platform
asked
me
if
i
knew
how
salt
water
differs
in
density
from
sea
to
sea
i
said
no
adding
that
there
was
a
lack
of
rigorous
scientific
observations
on
this
subject
ive
taken
such
observations
he
told
me
and
i
can
vouch
for
their
reliability
fine
i
replied
but
the
nautilus
lives
in
a
separate
world
and
the
secrets
of
its
scientists
dont
make
their
way
ashore
youre
right
professor
he
told
me
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
this
is
a
separate
world
its
as
alien
to
the
earth
as
the
planets
accompanying
our
globe
around
the
sun
and
well
never
become
familiar
with
the
work
of
scientists
on
saturn
or
jupiter
but
since
fate
has
linked
our
two
lives
i
can
reveal
the
results
of
my
observations
to
you
im
all
attention
captain
youre
aware
professor
that
salt
water
is
denser
than
fresh
water
but
this
density
isnt
uniform
in
essence
if
i
represent
the
density
of
fresh
water
by
1000
then
i
find
1028
for
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
1026
for
the
waters
of
the
pacific
1030
for
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
aha
i
thought
so
he
ventures
into
the
mediterranean
1018
for
the
waters
of
the
ionian
sea
and
1029
for
the
waters
of
the
adriatic
assuredly
the
nautilus
didnt
avoid
the
heavily
traveled
seas
of
europe
and
from
this
insight
i
concluded
that
the
ship
would
take
us
backperhaps
very
soonto
more
civilized
shores
i
expected
ned
land
to
greet
this
news
with
unfeigned
satisfaction
for
several
days
our
work
hours
were
spent
in
all
sorts
of
experiments
on
the
degree
of
salinity
in
waters
of
different
depths
or
on
their
electric
properties
coloration
and
transparency
and
in
every
instance
captain
nemo
displayed
an
ingenuity
equaled
only
by
his
graciousness
toward
me
then
i
saw
no
more
of
him
for
some
days
and
again
lived
on
board
in
seclusion
on
january
16
the
nautilus
seemed
to
have
fallen
asleep
just
a
few
meters
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
its
electric
equipment
had
been
turned
off
and
the
motionless
propeller
let
it
ride
with
the
waves
i
assumed
that
the
crew
were
busy
with
interior
repairs
required
by
the
engines
strenuous
mechanical
action
my
companions
and
i
then
witnessed
an
unusual
sight
the
panels
in
the
lounge
were
open
and
since
the
nautiluss
beacon
was
off
a
hazy
darkness
reigned
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
covered
with
heavy
clouds
the
stormy
sky
gave
only
the
faintest
light
to
the
oceans
upper
strata
i
was
observing
the
state
of
the
sea
under
these
conditions
and
even
the
largest
fish
were
nothing
more
than
illdefined
shadows
when
the
nautilus
was
suddenly
transferred
into
broad
daylight
at
first
i
thought
the
beacon
had
gone
back
on
and
was
casting
its
electric
light
into
the
liquid
mass
i
was
mistaken
and
after
a
hasty
examination
i
discovered
my
error
the
nautilus
had
drifted
into
the
midst
of
some
phosphorescent
strata
which
in
this
darkness
came
off
as
positively
dazzling
this
effect
was
caused
by
myriads
of
tiny
luminous
animals
whose
brightness
increased
when
they
glided
over
the
metal
hull
of
our
submersible
in
the
midst
of
these
luminous
sheets
of
water
i
then
glimpsed
flashes
of
light
like
those
seen
inside
a
blazing
furnace
from
streams
of
molten
lead
or
from
masses
of
metal
brought
to
a
white
heatflashes
so
intense
that
certain
areas
of
the
light
became
shadows
by
comparison
in
a
fiery
setting
from
which
every
shadow
should
seemingly
have
been
banished
no
this
was
no
longer
the
calm
emission
of
our
usual
lighting
this
light
throbbed
with
unprecedented
vigor
and
activity
you
sensed
that
it
was
alive
in
essence
it
was
a
cluster
of
countless
opensea
infusoria
of
noctiluca
an
eighth
of
an
inch
wide
actual
globules
of
transparent
jelly
equipped
with
a
threadlike
tentacle
up
to
25000
of
which
have
been
counted
in
thirty
cubic
centimeters
of
water
and
the
power
of
their
light
was
increased
by
those
glimmers
unique
to
medusas
starfish
common
jellyfish
angelwing
clams
and
other
phosphorescent
zoophytes
which
were
saturated
with
grease
from
organic
matter
decomposed
by
the
sea
and
perhaps
with
mucus
secreted
by
fish
for
several
hours
the
nautilus
drifted
in
this
brilliant
tide
and
our
wonderment
grew
when
we
saw
huge
marine
animals
cavorting
in
it
like
the
firedwelling
salamanders
of
myth
in
the
midst
of
these
flames
that
didnt
burn
i
could
see
swift
elegant
porpoises
the
tireless
pranksters
of
the
seas
and
sailfish
three
meters
long
those
shrewd
heralds
of
hurricanes
whose
fearsome
broadswords
sometimes
banged
against
the
lounge
window
then
smaller
fish
appeared
miscellaneous
triggerfish
leather
jacks
unicornfish
and
a
hundred
others
that
left
stripes
on
this
luminous
atmosphere
in
their
course
some
magic
lay
behind
this
dazzling
sight
perhaps
some
atmospheric
condition
had
intensified
this
phenomenon
perhaps
a
storm
had
been
unleashed
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
but
only
a
few
meters
down
the
nautilus
felt
no
tempests
fury
and
the
ship
rocked
peacefully
in
the
midst
of
the
calm
waters
and
so
it
went
some
new
wonder
constantly
delighting
us
conseil
observed
and
classified
his
zoophytes
articulates
mollusks
and
fish
the
days
passed
quickly
and
i
no
longer
kept
track
of
them
ned
as
usual
kept
looking
for
changes
of
pace
from
our
standard
fare
like
actual
snails
we
were
at
home
in
our
shell
and
i
can
vouch
that
its
easy
to
turn
into
a
fullfledged
snail
so
this
way
of
living
began
to
seem
simple
and
natural
to
us
and
we
no
longer
envisioned
a
different
lifestyle
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
earth
when
something
happened
to
remind
us
of
our
strange
circumstances
on
january
18
the
nautilus
lay
in
longitude
105
degrees
and
latitude
15
degrees
south
the
weather
was
threatening
the
sea
rough
and
billowy
the
wind
was
blowing
a
strong
gust
from
the
east
the
barometer
which
had
been
falling
for
some
days
forecast
an
approaching
struggle
of
the
elements
i
had
climbed
onto
the
platform
just
as
the
chief
officer
was
taking
his
readings
of
hour
angles
out
of
habit
i
waited
for
him
to
pronounce
his
daily
phrase
but
that
day
it
was
replaced
by
a
different
phrase
just
as
incomprehensible
almost
at
once
i
saw
captain
nemo
appear
lift
his
spyglass
and
inspect
the
horizon
for
some
minutes
the
captain
stood
motionless
rooted
to
the
spot
contained
within
the
field
of
his
lens
then
he
lowered
his
spyglass
and
exchanged
about
ten
words
with
his
chief
officer
the
latter
seemed
to
be
in
the
grip
of
an
excitement
he
tried
in
vain
to
control
more
in
command
of
himself
captain
nemo
remained
cool
furthermore
he
seemed
to
be
raising
certain
objections
that
his
chief
officer
kept
answering
with
flat
assurances
at
least
thats
what
i
gathered
from
their
differences
in
tone
and
gesture
as
for
me
i
stared
industriously
in
the
direction
under
observation
but
without
spotting
a
thing
sky
and
water
merged
into
a
perfectly
clean
horizon
line
meanwhile
captain
nemo
strolled
from
one
end
of
the
platform
to
the
other
not
glancing
at
me
perhaps
not
even
seeing
me
his
step
was
firm
but
less
regular
than
usual
sometimes
he
would
stop
cross
his
arms
over
his
chest
and
observe
the
sea
what
could
he
be
looking
for
over
that
immense
expanse
by
then
the
nautilus
lay
hundreds
of
miles
from
the
nearest
coast
the
chief
officer
kept
lifting
his
spyglass
and
stubbornly
examining
the
horizon
walking
up
and
down
stamping
his
foot
in
his
nervous
agitation
a
sharp
contrast
to
his
superior
but
this
mystery
would
inevitably
be
cleared
up
and
soon
because
captain
nemo
gave
orders
to
increase
speed
at
once
the
engine
stepped
up
its
drive
power
setting
the
propeller
in
swifter
rotation
just
then
the
chief
officer
drew
the
captains
attention
anew
the
latter
interrupted
his
strolling
and
aimed
his
spyglass
at
the
point
indicated
he
observed
it
a
good
while
as
for
me
deeply
puzzled
i
went
below
to
the
lounge
and
brought
back
an
excellent
longrange
telescope
i
habitually
used
leaning
my
elbows
on
the
beacon
housing
which
jutted
from
the
stern
of
the
platform
i
got
set
to
scour
that
whole
stretch
of
sky
and
sea
but
no
sooner
had
i
peered
into
the
eyepiece
than
the
instrument
was
snatched
from
my
hands
i
spun
around
captain
nemo
was
standing
before
me
but
i
almost
didnt
recognize
him
his
facial
features
were
transfigured
gleaming
with
dark
fire
his
eyes
had
shrunk
beneath
his
frowning
brow
his
teeth
were
half
bared
his
rigid
body
clenched
fists
and
head
drawn
between
his
shoulders
all
attested
to
a
fierce
hate
breathing
from
every
pore
he
didnt
move
my
spyglass
fell
from
his
hand
and
rolled
at
his
feet
had
i
accidentally
caused
these
symptoms
of
anger
did
this
incomprehensible
individual
think
i
had
detected
some
secret
forbidden
to
guests
on
the
nautilus
no
i
wasnt
the
subject
of
his
hate
because
he
wasnt
even
looking
at
me
his
eyes
stayed
stubbornly
focused
on
that
inscrutable
point
of
the
horizon
finally
captain
nemo
regained
his
selfcontrol
his
facial
appearance
so
profoundly
changed
now
resumed
its
usual
calm
he
addressed
a
few
words
to
his
chief
officer
in
their
strange
language
then
he
turned
to
me
professor
aronnax
he
told
me
in
a
tone
of
some
urgency
i
ask
that
you
now
honor
one
of
the
binding
agreements
between
us
which
one
captain
you
and
your
companions
must
be
placed
in
confinement
until
i
see
fit
to
set
you
free
youre
in
command
i
answered
gaping
at
him
but
may
i
address
a
question
to
you
you
may
not
sir
after
that
i
stopped
objecting
and
started
obeying
since
resistance
was
useless
i
went
below
to
the
cabin
occupied
by
ned
land
and
conseil
and
i
informed
them
of
the
captains
decision
ill
let
the
reader
decide
how
this
news
was
received
by
the
canadian
in
any
case
there
was
no
time
for
explanations
four
crewmen
were
waiting
at
the
door
and
they
led
us
to
the
cell
where
we
had
spent
our
first
night
aboard
the
nautilus
ned
land
tried
to
lodge
a
complaint
but
the
only
answer
he
got
was
a
door
shut
in
his
face
will
master
tell
me
what
this
means
conseil
asked
me
i
told
my
companions
what
had
happened
they
were
as
astonished
as
i
was
but
no
wiser
then
i
sank
into
deep
speculation
and
captain
nemos
strange
facial
seizure
kept
haunting
me
i
was
incapable
of
connecting
two
ideas
in
logical
order
and
i
had
strayed
into
the
most
absurd
hypotheses
when
i
was
snapped
out
of
my
mental
struggles
by
these
words
from
ned
land
well
look
here
lunch
is
served
indeed
the
table
had
been
laid
apparently
captain
nemo
had
given
this
order
at
the
same
time
he
commanded
the
nautilus
to
pick
up
speed
will
master
allow
me
to
make
him
a
recommendation
conseil
asked
me
yes
my
boy
i
replied
well
master
needs
to
eat
his
lunch
its
prudent
because
we
have
no
idea
what
the
future
holds
youre
right
conseil
unfortunately
ned
land
said
theyve
only
given
us
the
standard
menu
ned
my
friend
conseil
answered
what
would
you
say
if
theyd
given
us
no
lunch
at
all
this
dose
of
sanity
cut
the
harpooners
complaints
clean
off
we
sat
down
at
the
table
our
meal
proceeded
pretty
much
in
silence
i
ate
very
little
conseil
everlastingly
prudent
forcefed
himself
and
despite
the
menu
ned
land
didnt
waste
a
bite
then
lunch
over
each
of
us
propped
himself
in
a
corner
just
then
the
luminous
globe
lighting
our
cell
went
out
leaving
us
in
profound
darkness
ned
land
soon
dozed
off
and
to
my
astonishment
conseil
also
fell
into
a
heavy
slumber
i
was
wondering
what
could
have
caused
this
urgent
need
for
sleep
when
i
felt
a
dense
torpor
saturate
my
brain
i
tried
to
keep
my
eyes
open
but
they
closed
in
spite
of
me
i
was
in
the
grip
of
anguished
hallucinations
obviously
some
sleepinducing
substance
had
been
laced
into
the
food
wed
just
eaten
so
imprisonment
wasnt
enough
to
conceal
captain
nemos
plans
from
ussleep
was
needed
as
well
then
i
heard
the
hatches
close
the
seas
undulations
which
had
been
creating
a
gentle
rocking
motion
now
ceased
had
the
nautilus
left
the
surface
of
the
ocean
was
it
reentering
the
motionless
strata
deep
in
the
sea
i
tried
to
fight
off
this
drowsiness
it
was
impossible
my
breathing
grew
weaker
i
felt
a
mortal
chill
freeze
my
dull
nearly
paralyzed
limbs
like
little
domes
of
lead
my
lids
fell
over
my
eyes
i
couldnt
raise
them
a
morbid
sleep
full
of
hallucinations
seized
my
whole
being
then
the
visions
disappeared
and
left
me
in
utter
oblivion

the
coral
realm
the
next
day
i
woke
up
with
my
head
unusually
clear
much
to
my
surprise
i
was
in
my
stateroom
no
doubt
my
companions
had
been
put
back
in
their
cabin
without
noticing
it
any
more
than
i
had
like
me
they
would
have
no
idea
what
took
place
during
the
night
and
to
unravel
this
mystery
i
could
count
only
on
some
future
happenstance
i
then
considered
leaving
my
stateroom
was
i
free
or
still
a
prisoner
perfectly
free
i
opened
my
door
headed
down
the
gangways
and
climbed
the
central
companionway
hatches
that
had
been
closed
the
day
before
were
now
open
i
arrived
on
the
platform
ned
land
and
conseil
were
there
waiting
for
me
i
questioned
them
they
knew
nothing
lost
in
a
heavy
sleep
of
which
they
had
no
memory
they
were
quite
startled
to
be
back
in
their
cabin
as
for
the
nautilus
it
seemed
as
tranquil
and
mysterious
as
ever
it
was
cruising
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
at
a
moderate
speed
nothing
seemed
to
have
changed
on
board
ned
land
observed
the
sea
with
his
penetrating
eyes
it
was
deserted
the
canadian
sighted
nothing
new
on
the
horizon
neither
sail
nor
shore
a
breeze
was
blowing
noisily
from
the
west
and
disheveled
by
the
wind
long
billows
made
the
submersible
roll
very
noticeably
after
renewing
its
air
the
nautilus
stayed
at
an
average
depth
of
fifteen
meters
enabling
it
to
return
quickly
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
and
contrary
to
custom
it
executed
such
a
maneuver
several
times
during
that
day
of
january
19
the
chief
officer
would
then
climb
onto
the
platform
and
his
usual
phrase
would
ring
through
the
ships
interior
as
for
captain
nemo
he
didnt
appear
of
the
other
men
on
board
i
saw
only
my
emotionless
steward
who
served
me
with
his
usual
mute
efficiency
near
two
oclock
i
was
busy
organizing
my
notes
in
the
lounge
when
the
captain
opened
the
door
and
appeared
i
bowed
to
him
he
gave
me
an
almost
imperceptible
bow
in
return
without
saying
a
word
to
me
i
resumed
my
work
hoping
he
might
give
me
some
explanation
of
the
previous
afternoons
events
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
i
stared
at
him
his
face
looked
exhausted
his
reddened
eyes
hadnt
been
refreshed
by
sleep
his
facial
features
expressed
profound
sadness
real
chagrin
he
walked
up
and
down
sat
and
stood
picked
up
a
book
at
random
discarded
it
immediately
consulted
his
instruments
without
taking
his
customary
notes
and
seemed
unable
to
rest
easy
for
an
instant
finally
he
came
over
to
me
and
said
are
you
a
physician
professor
aronnax
this
inquiry
was
so
unexpected
that
i
stared
at
him
a
good
while
without
replying
are
you
a
physician
he
repeated
several
of
your
scientific
colleagues
took
their
degrees
in
medicine
such
as
gratiolet
moquintandon
and
others
thats
right
i
said
i
am
a
doctor
i
used
to
be
on
call
at
the
hospitals
i
was
in
practice
for
several
years
before
joining
the
museum
excellent
sir
my
reply
obviously
pleased
captain
nemo
but
not
knowing
what
he
was
driving
at
i
waited
for
further
questions
ready
to
reply
as
circumstances
dictated
professor
aronnax
the
captain
said
to
me
would
you
consent
to
give
your
medical
attentions
to
one
of
my
men
someone
is
sick
yes
im
ready
to
go
with
you
come
i
admit
that
my
heart
was
pounding
lord
knows
why
but
i
saw
a
definite
connection
between
this
sick
crewman
and
yesterdays
happenings
and
the
mystery
of
those
events
concerned
me
at
least
as
much
as
the
mans
sickness
captain
nemo
led
me
to
the
nautiluss
stern
and
invited
me
into
a
cabin
located
next
to
the
sailors
quarters
on
a
bed
there
lay
a
man
some
forty
years
old
with
strongly
molded
features
the
very
image
of
an
anglosaxon
i
bent
over
him
not
only
was
he
sick
he
was
wounded
swathed
in
bloodsoaked
linen
his
head
was
resting
on
a
folded
pillow
i
undid
the
linen
bandages
while
the
wounded
man
gazed
with
great
staring
eyes
and
let
me
proceed
without
making
a
single
complaint
it
was
a
horrible
wound
the
cranium
had
been
smashed
open
by
some
blunt
instrument
leaving
the
naked
brains
exposed
and
the
cerebral
matter
had
suffered
deep
abrasions
blood
clots
had
formed
in
this
dissolving
mass
taking
on
the
color
of
wine
dregs
both
contusion
and
concussion
of
the
brain
had
occurred
the
sick
mans
breathing
was
labored
and
muscle
spasms
quivered
in
his
face
cerebral
inflammation
was
complete
and
had
brought
on
a
paralysis
of
movement
and
sensation
i
took
the
wounded
mans
pulse
it
was
intermittent
the
bodys
extremities
were
already
growing
cold
and
i
saw
that
death
was
approaching
without
any
possibility
of
my
holding
it
in
check
after
dressing
the
poor
mans
wound
i
redid
the
linen
bandages
around
his
head
and
i
turned
to
captain
nemo
how
did
he
get
this
wound
i
asked
him
thats
not
important
the
captain
replied
evasively
the
nautilus
suffered
a
collision
that
cracked
one
of
the
engine
levers
and
it
struck
this
man
my
chief
officer
was
standing
beside
him
this
man
leaped
forward
to
intercept
the
blow
a
brother
lays
down
his
life
for
his
brother
a
friend
for
his
friend
what
could
be
simpler
thats
the
law
for
everyone
on
board
the
nautilus
but
whats
your
diagnosis
of
his
condition
i
hesitated
to
speak
my
mind
you
may
talk
freely
the
captain
told
me
this
man
doesnt
understand
french
i
took
a
last
look
at
the
wounded
man
then
i
replied
this
man
will
be
dead
in
two
hours
nothing
can
save
him
nothing
captain
nemo
clenched
his
fists
and
tears
slid
from
his
eyes
which
i
had
thought
incapable
of
weeping
for
a
few
moments
more
i
observed
the
dying
man
whose
life
was
ebbing
little
by
little
he
grew
still
more
pale
under
the
electric
light
that
bathed
his
deathbed
i
looked
at
his
intelligent
head
furrowed
with
premature
wrinkles
that
misfortune
perhaps
misery
had
etched
long
before
i
was
hoping
to
detect
the
secret
of
his
life
in
the
last
words
that
might
escape
from
his
lips
you
may
go
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
told
me
i
left
the
captain
in
the
dying
mans
cabin
and
i
repaired
to
my
stateroom
very
moved
by
this
scene
all
day
long
i
was
aquiver
with
gruesome
forebodings
that
night
i
slept
poorly
and
between
my
fitful
dreams
i
thought
i
heard
a
distant
moaning
like
a
funeral
dirge
was
it
a
prayer
for
the
dead
murmured
in
that
language
i
couldnt
understand
the
next
morning
i
climbed
on
deck
captain
nemo
was
already
there
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
came
over
professor
he
said
to
me
would
it
be
convenient
for
you
to
make
an
underwater
excursion
today
with
my
companions
i
asked
if
theyre
agreeable
were
yours
to
command
captain
then
kindly
put
on
your
diving
suits
as
for
the
dead
or
dying
man
he
hadnt
come
into
the
picture
i
rejoined
ned
land
and
conseil
i
informed
them
of
captain
nemos
proposition
conseil
was
eager
to
accept
and
this
time
the
canadian
proved
perfectly
amenable
to
going
with
us
it
was
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
by
830
we
were
suited
up
for
this
new
stroll
and
equipped
with
our
two
devices
for
lighting
and
breathing
the
double
door
opened
and
accompanied
by
captain
nemo
with
a
dozen
crewmen
following
we
set
foot
on
the
firm
seafloor
where
the
nautilus
was
resting
ten
meters
down
a
gentle
slope
gravitated
to
an
uneven
bottom
whose
depth
was
about
fifteen
fathoms
this
bottom
was
completely
different
from
the
one
i
had
visited
during
my
first
excursion
under
the
waters
of
the
pacific
ocean
here
i
saw
no
finegrained
sand
no
underwater
prairies
not
one
opensea
forest
i
immediately
recognized
the
wondrous
region
in
which
captain
nemo
did
the
honors
that
day
it
was
the
coral
realm
in
the
zoophyte
branch
class
alcyonaria
one
finds
the
order
gorgonaria
which
contains
three
groups
sea
fans
isidian
polyps
and
coral
polyps
its
in
this
last
that
precious
coral
belongs
an
unusual
substance
that
at
different
times
has
been
classified
in
the
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
kingdoms
medicine
to
the
ancients
jewelry
to
the
moderns
it
wasnt
decisively
placed
in
the
animal
kingdom
until
1694
by
peysonnel
of
marseilles
a
coral
is
a
unit
of
tiny
animals
assembled
over
a
polypary
thats
brittle
and
stony
in
nature
these
polyps
have
a
unique
generating
mechanism
that
reproduces
them
via
the
budding
process
and
they
have
an
individual
existence
while
also
participating
in
a
communal
life
hence
they
embody
a
sort
of
natural
socialism
i
was
familiar
with
the
latest
research
on
this
bizarre
zoophytewhich
turns
to
stone
while
taking
on
a
tree
form
as
some
naturalists
have
very
aptly
observedand
nothing
could
have
been
more
fascinating
to
me
than
to
visit
one
of
these
petrified
forests
that
nature
has
planted
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
we
turned
on
our
ruhmkorff
devices
and
went
along
a
coral
shoal
in
the
process
of
forming
which
given
time
will
someday
close
off
this
whole
part
of
the
indian
ocean
our
path
was
bordered
by
hopelessly
tangled
bushes
formed
from
snarls
of
shrubs
all
covered
with
little
starshaped
whitestreaked
flowers
only
contrary
to
plants
on
shore
these
tree
forms
become
attached
to
rocks
on
the
seafloor
by
heading
from
top
to
bottom
our
lights
produced
a
thousand
delightful
effects
while
playing
over
these
brightly
colored
boughs
i
fancied
i
saw
these
cylindrical
membranefilled
tubes
trembling
beneath
the
waters
undulations
i
was
tempted
to
gather
their
fresh
petals
which
were
adorned
with
delicate
tentacles
some
newly
in
bloom
others
barely
opened
while
nimble
fish
with
fluttering
fins
brushed
past
them
like
flocks
of
birds
but
if
my
hands
came
near
the
moving
flowers
of
these
sensitive
lively
creatures
an
alarm
would
instantly
sound
throughout
the
colony
the
white
petals
retracted
into
their
red
sheaths
the
flowers
vanished
before
my
eyes
and
the
bush
changed
into
a
chunk
of
stony
nipples
sheer
chance
had
placed
me
in
the
presence
of
the
most
valuable
specimens
of
this
zoophyte
this
coral
was
the
equal
of
those
fished
up
from
the
mediterranean
off
the
barbary
coast
or
the
shores
of
france
and
italy
with
its
bright
colors
it
lived
up
to
those
poetic
names
of
blood
flower
and
blood
foam
that
the
industry
confers
on
its
finest
exhibits
coral
sells
for
as
much
as
500
francs
per
kilogram
and
in
this
locality
the
liquid
strata
hid
enough
to
make
the
fortunes
of
a
whole
host
of
coral
fishermen
this
valuable
substance
often
merges
with
other
polyparies
forming
compact
hopelessly
tangled
units
known
as
macciota
and
i
noted
some
wonderful
pink
samples
of
this
coral
but
as
the
bushes
shrank
the
tree
forms
magnified
actual
petrified
thickets
and
long
alcoves
from
some
fantastic
school
of
architecture
kept
opening
up
before
our
steps
captain
nemo
entered
beneath
a
dark
gallery
whose
gentle
slope
took
us
to
a
depth
of
100
meters
the
light
from
our
glass
coils
produced
magical
effects
at
times
lingering
on
the
wrinkled
roughness
of
some
natural
arch
or
some
overhang
suspended
like
a
chandelier
which
our
lamps
flecked
with
fiery
sparks
amid
these
shrubs
of
precious
coral
i
observed
other
polyps
no
less
unusual
melita
coral
rainbow
coral
with
jointed
outgrowths
then
a
few
tufts
of
genus
corallina
some
green
and
others
red
actually
a
type
of
seaweed
encrusted
with
limestone
salts
which
after
long
disputes
naturalists
have
finally
placed
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
but
as
one
intellectual
has
remarked
here
perhaps
is
the
actual
point
where
life
rises
humbly
out
of
slumbering
stone
but
without
breaking
away
from
its
crude
starting
point
finally
after
two
hours
of
walking
we
reached
a
depth
of
about
300
meters
in
other
words
the
lowermost
limit
at
which
coral
can
begin
to
form
but
here
it
was
no
longer
some
isolated
bush
or
a
modest
grove
of
low
timber
it
was
an
immense
forest
huge
mineral
vegetation
enormous
petrified
trees
linked
by
garlands
of
elegant
hydras
from
the
genus
plumularia
those
tropical
creepers
of
the
sea
all
decked
out
in
shades
and
gleams
we
passed
freely
under
their
lofty
boughs
lost
up
in
the
shadows
of
the
waves
while
at
our
feet
organpipe
coral
stony
coral
star
coral
fungus
coral
and
sea
anemone
from
the
genus
caryophylia
formed
a
carpet
of
flowers
all
strewn
with
dazzling
gems
what
an
indescribable
sight
oh
if
only
we
could
share
our
feelings
why
were
we
imprisoned
behind
these
masks
of
metal
and
glass
why
were
we
forbidden
to
talk
with
each
other
at
least
let
us
lead
the
lives
of
the
fish
that
populate
this
liquid
element
or
better
yet
the
lives
of
amphibians
which
can
spend
long
hours
either
at
sea
or
on
shore
traveling
through
their
double
domain
as
their
whims
dictate
meanwhile
captain
nemo
had
called
a
halt
my
companions
and
i
stopped
walking
and
turning
around
i
saw
the
crewmen
form
a
semicircle
around
their
leader
looking
with
greater
care
i
observed
that
four
of
them
were
carrying
on
their
shoulders
an
object
that
was
oblong
in
shape
at
this
locality
we
stood
in
the
center
of
a
huge
clearing
surrounded
by
the
tall
tree
forms
of
this
underwater
forest
our
lamps
cast
a
sort
of
brilliant
twilight
over
the
area
making
inordinately
long
shadows
on
the
seafloor
past
the
boundaries
of
the
clearing
the
darkness
deepened
again
relieved
only
by
little
sparkles
given
off
by
the
sharp
crests
of
coral
ned
land
and
conseil
stood
next
to
me
we
stared
and
it
dawned
on
me
that
i
was
about
to
witness
a
strange
scene
observing
the
seafloor
i
saw
that
it
swelled
at
certain
points
from
low
bulges
that
were
encrusted
with
limestone
deposits
and
arranged
with
a
symmetry
that
betrayed
the
hand
of
man
in
the
middle
of
the
clearing
on
a
pedestal
of
roughly
piled
rocks
there
stood
a
cross
of
coral
extending
long
arms
you
would
have
thought
were
made
of
petrified
blood
at
a
signal
from
captain
nemo
one
of
his
men
stepped
forward
and
a
few
feet
from
this
cross
detached
a
mattock
from
his
belt
and
began
to
dig
a
hole
i
finally
understood
this
clearing
was
a
cemetery
this
hole
a
grave
that
oblong
object
the
body
of
the
man
who
must
have
died
during
the
night
captain
nemo
and
his
men
had
come
to
bury
their
companion
in
this
communal
resting
place
on
the
inaccessible
ocean
floor
no
my
mind
was
reeling
as
never
before
never
had
ideas
of
such
impact
raced
through
my
brain
i
didnt
want
to
see
what
my
eyes
saw
meanwhile
the
grave
digging
went
slowly
fish
fled
here
and
there
as
their
retreat
was
disturbed
i
heard
the
pick
ringing
on
the
limestone
soil
its
iron
tip
sometimes
giving
off
sparks
when
it
hit
a
stray
piece
of
flint
on
the
sea
bottom
the
hole
grew
longer
wider
and
soon
was
deep
enough
to
receive
the
body
then
the
pallbearers
approached
wrapped
in
white
fabric
made
from
filaments
of
the
fan
mussel
the
body
was
lowered
into
its
watery
grave
captain
nemo
arms
crossed
over
his
chest
knelt
in
a
posture
of
prayer
as
did
all
the
friends
of
him
who
had
loved
them



my
two
companions
and
i
bowed
reverently
the
grave
was
then
covered
over
with
the
rubble
dug
from
the
seafloor
and
it
formed
a
low
mound
when
this
was
done
captain
nemo
and
his
men
stood
up
then
they
all
approached
the
grave
sank
again
on
bended
knee
and
extended
their
hands
in
a
sign
of
final
farewell



then
the
funeral
party
went
back
up
the
path
to
the
nautilus
returning
beneath
the
arches
of
the
forest
through
the
thickets
along
the
coral
bushes
going
steadily
higher
finally
the
ships
rays
appeared
their
luminous
trail
guided
us
to
the
nautilus
by
one
oclock
we
had
returned
after
changing
clothes
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
and
in
the
grip
of
dreadfully
obsessive
thoughts
i
sat
next
to
the
beacon
captain
nemo
rejoined
me
i
stood
up
and
said
to
him
so
as
i
predicted
that
man
died
during
the
night
yes
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
replied
and
now
he
rests
beside
his
companions
in
that
coral
cemetery
yes
forgotten
by
the
world
but
not
by
us
we
dig
the
graves
then
entrust
the
polyps
with
sealing
away
our
dead
for
eternity
and
with
a
sudden
gesture
the
captain
hid
his
face
in
his
clenched
fists
vainly
trying
to
hold
back
a
sob
then
he
added
there
lies
our
peaceful
cemetery
hundreds
of
feet
beneath
the
surface
of
the
waves
at
least
captain
your
dead
can
sleep
serenely
there
out
of
the
reach
of
sharks
yes
sir
captain
nemo
replied
solemnly
of
sharks
and
men

the
indian
ocean
now
we
begin
the
second
part
of
this
voyage
under
the
seas
the
first
ended
in
that
moving
scene
at
the
coral
cemetery
which
left
a
profound
impression
on
my
mind
and
so
captain
nemo
would
live
out
his
life
entirely
in
the
heart
of
this
immense
sea
and
even
his
grave
lay
ready
in
its
impenetrable
depths
there
the
last
sleep
of
the
nautiluss
occupants
friends
bound
together
in
death
as
in
life
would
be
disturbed
by
no
monster
of
the
deep
no
man
either
the
captain
had
added
always
that
same
fierce
implacable
defiance
of
human
society
as
for
me
i
was
no
longer
content
with
the
hypotheses
that
satisfied
conseil
that
fine
lad
persisted
in
seeing
the
nautiluss
commander
as
merely
one
of
those
unappreciated
scientists
who
repay
humanitys
indifference
with
contempt
for
conseil
the
captain
was
still
a
misunderstood
genius
who
tired
of
the
worlds
deceptions
had
been
driven
to
take
refuge
in
this
inaccessible
environment
where
he
was
free
to
follow
his
instincts
but
to
my
mind
this
hypothesis
explained
only
one
side
of
captain
nemo
in
fact
the
mystery
of
that
last
afternoon
when
we
were
locked
in
prison
and
put
to
sleep
the
captains
violent
precaution
of
snatching
from
my
grasp
a
spyglass
poised
to
scour
the
horizon
and
the
fatal
wound
given
that
man
during
some
unexplained
collision
suffered
by
the
nautilus
all
led
me
down
a
plain
trail
no
captain
nemo
wasnt
content
simply
to
avoid
humanity
his
fearsome
submersible
served
not
only
his
quest
for
freedom
but
also
perhaps
it
was
used
in
lordknowswhat
schemes
of
dreadful
revenge
right
now
nothing
is
clear
to
me
i
still
glimpse
only
glimmers
in
the
dark
and
i
must
limit
my
pen
as
it
were
to
taking
dictation
from
events
but
nothing
binds
us
to
captain
nemo
he
believes
that
escaping
from
the
nautilus
is
impossible
we
are
not
even
constrained
by
our
word
of
honor
no
promises
fetter
us
were
simply
captives
prisoners
masquerading
under
the
name
guests
for
the
sake
of
everyday
courtesy
even
so
ned
land
hasnt
given
up
all
hope
of
recovering
his
freedom
hes
sure
to
take
advantage
of
the
first
chance
that
comes
his
way
no
doubt
i
will
do
likewise
and
yet
i
will
feel
some
regret
at
making
off
with
the
nautiluss
secrets
so
generously
unveiled
for
us
by
captain
nemo
because
ultimately
should
we
detest
or
admire
this
man
is
he
the
persecutor
or
the
persecuted
and
in
all
honesty
before
i
leave
him
forever
i
want
to
finish
this
underwater
tour
of
the
world
whose
first
stages
have
been
so
magnificent
i
want
to
observe
the
full
series
of
these
wonders
gathered
under
the
seas
of
our
globe
i
want
to
see
what
no
man
has
seen
yet
even
if
i
must
pay
for
this
insatiable
curiosity
with
my
life
what
are
my
discoveries
to
date
nothing
relatively
speakingsince
so
far
weve
covered
only
6000
leagues
across
the
pacific
nevertheless
im
well
aware
that
the
nautilus
is
drawing
near
to
populated
shores
and
if
some
chance
for
salvation
becomes
available
to
us
it
would
be
sheer
cruelty
to
sacrifice
my
companions
to
my
passion
for
the
unknown
i
must
go
with
them
perhaps
even
guide
them
but
will
this
opportunity
ever
arise
the
human
being
robbed
of
his
free
will
craves
such
an
opportunity
but
the
scientist
forever
inquisitive
dreads
it
that
day
january
21
1868
the
chief
officer
went
at
noon
to
take
the
suns
altitude
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
lit
a
cigar
and
watched
him
at
work
it
seemed
obvious
to
me
that
this
man
didnt
understand
french
because
i
made
several
remarks
in
a
loud
voice
that
were
bound
to
provoke
him
to
some
involuntary
show
of
interest
had
he
understood
them
but
he
remained
mute
and
emotionless
while
he
took
his
sights
with
his
sextant
one
of
the
nautiluss
sailorsthat
muscular
man
who
had
gone
with
us
to
crespo
island
during
our
first
underwater
excursioncame
up
to
clean
the
glass
panes
of
the
beacon
i
then
examined
the
fittings
of
this
mechanism
whose
power
was
increased
a
hundredfold
by
biconvex
lenses
that
were
designed
like
those
in
a
lighthouse
and
kept
its
rays
productively
focused
this
electric
lamp
was
so
constructed
as
to
yield
its
maximum
illuminating
power
in
essence
its
light
was
generated
in
a
vacuum
insuring
both
its
steadiness
and
intensity
such
a
vacuum
also
reduced
wear
on
the
graphite
points
between
which
the
luminous
arc
expanded
this
was
an
important
savings
for
captain
nemo
who
couldnt
easily
renew
them
but
under
these
conditions
wear
and
tear
were
almost
nonexistent
when
the
nautilus
was
ready
to
resume
its
underwater
travels
i
went
below
again
to
the
lounge
the
hatches
closed
once
more
and
our
course
was
set
due
west
we
then
plowed
the
waves
of
the
indian
ocean
vast
liquid
plains
with
an
area
of
550000000
hectares
whose
waters
are
so
transparent
it
makes
you
dizzy
to
lean
over
their
surface
there
the
nautilus
generally
drifted
at
a
depth
between
100
and
200
meters
it
behaved
in
this
way
for
some
days
to
anyone
without
my
grand
passion
for
the
sea
these
hours
would
surely
have
seemed
long
and
monotonous
but
my
daily
strolls
on
the
platform
where
i
was
revived
by
the
lifegiving
ocean
air
the
sights
in
the
rich
waters
beyond
the
lounge
windows
the
books
to
be
read
in
the
library
and
the
composition
of
my
memoirs
took
up
all
my
time
and
left
me
without
a
moment
of
weariness
or
boredom
all
in
all
we
enjoyed
a
highly
satisfactory
state
of
health
the
diet
on
board
agreed
with
us
perfectly
and
for
my
part
i
could
easily
have
gone
without
those
changes
of
pace
that
ned
land
in
a
spirit
of
protest
kept
taxing
his
ingenuity
to
supply
us
whats
more
in
this
constant
temperature
we
didnt
even
have
to
worry
about
catching
colds
besides
the
ship
had
a
good
stock
of
the
madrepore
dendrophylia
known
in
provence
by
the
name
sea
fennel
and
a
poultice
made
from
the
dissolved
flesh
of
its
polyps
will
furnish
an
excellent
cough
medicine
for
some
days
we
saw
a
large
number
of
aquatic
birds
with
webbed
feet
known
as
gulls
or
sea
mews
some
were
skillfully
slain
and
when
cooked
in
a
certain
fashion
they
make
a
very
acceptable
platter
of
water
game
among
the
great
wind
riderscarried
over
long
distances
from
every
shore
and
resting
on
the
waves
from
their
exhausting
flightsi
spotted
some
magnificent
albatross
birds
belonging
to
the
longipennes
longwinged
family
whose
discordant
calls
sound
like
the
braying
of
an
ass
the
totipalmes
fully
webbed
family
was
represented
by
swift
frigate
birds
nimbly
catching
fish
at
the
surface
and
by
numerous
tropic
birds
of
the
genus
phaeton
among
others
the
redtailed
tropic
bird
the
size
of
a
pigeon
its
white
plumage
shaded
with
pink
tints
that
contrasted
with
its
darkhued
wings
the
nautiluss
nets
hauled
up
several
types
of
sea
turtle
from
the
hawksbill
genus
with
arching
backs
whose
scales
are
highly
prized
diving
easily
these
reptiles
can
remain
a
good
while
underwater
by
closing
the
fleshy
valves
located
at
the
external
openings
of
their
nasal
passages
when
they
were
captured
some
hawksbills
were
still
asleep
inside
their
carapaces
a
refuge
from
other
marine
animals
the
flesh
of
these
turtles
was
nothing
memorable
but
their
eggs
made
an
excellent
feast
as
for
fish
they
always
filled
us
with
wonderment
when
staring
through
the
open
panels
we
could
unveil
the
secrets
of
their
aquatic
lives
i
noted
several
species
i
hadnt
previously
been
able
to
observe
ill
mention
chiefly
some
trunkfish
unique
to
the
red
sea
the
sea
of
the
east
indies
and
that
part
of
the
ocean
washing
the
coasts
of
equinoctial
america
like
turtles
armadillos
sea
urchins
and
crustaceans
these
fish
are
protected
by
armor
plate
thats
neither
chalky
nor
stony
but
actual
bone
sometimes
this
armor
takes
the
shape
of
a
solid
triangle
sometimes
that
of
a
solid
quadrangle
among
the
triangular
type
i
noticed
some
half
a
decimeter
long
with
brown
tails
yellow
fins
and
wholesome
exquisitely
tasty
flesh
i
even
recommend
that
they
be
acclimatized
to
fresh
water
a
change
incidentally
that
a
number
of
saltwater
fish
can
make
with
ease
ill
also
mention
some
quadrangular
trunkfish
topped
by
four
large
protuberances
along
the
back
trunkfish
sprinkled
with
white
spots
on
the
underside
of

the

traveled

the

250
leagues
in
twentyfour
hours
hence
540
miles
at
twentytwo
miles
per

if
during
our
trip
we
were
able
to
identify
these
different
varieties
of
fish
its
because
they
were
attracted
by
our
electric
light
and
tried
to
follow
alongside
but
most
of
them
were
outdistanced
by
our
speed
and
soon
fell
behind
temporarily
however
a
few
managed
to
keep
pace
in
the
nautiluss
waters
on
the

we
raised
keeling
island
a
madreporic
upheaving
planted
with
magnificent
coconut
trees
which
had
been
visited
by
mr
darwin
and
captain
fitzroy
the
nautilus
cruised
along
a
short
distance
off
the
shore
of
this
desert
island
our
dragnets
brought
up
many
specimens
of
polyps
and
echinoderms
plus
some
unusual
shells
from
the
branch
mollusca
captain
nemos
treasures
were
enhanced
by
some
valuable
exhibits
from
the
delphinula
snail
species
to
which
i
joined
some
pointed
star
coral
a
sort
of
parasitic
polypary
that
often
attaches
itself
to
seashells
soon
keeling
island
disappeared
below
the
horizon
and
our
course
was
set
to
the
northwest
toward
the
tip
of
the
indian
peninsula
civilization
ned
land
told
me
that
day
much
better
than
those
papuan
islands
where
we
ran
into
more
savages
than
venison
on
this
indian
shore
professor
there
are
roads
and
railways
english
french
and
hindu
villages
we
wouldnt
go
five
miles
without
bumping
into
a
fellow
countryman
come
on
now
isnt
it
time
for
our
sudden
departure
from
captain
nemo
no
no
ned
i
replied
in
a
very
firm
tone
lets
ride
it
out
as
you
seafaring
fellows
say
the
nautilus
is
approaching
populated
areas
its
going
back
toward
europe
let
it
take
us
there
after
we
arrive
in
home
waters
we
can
do
as
we
see
fit
besides
i
dont
imagine
captain
nemo
will
let
us
go
hunting
on
the
coasts
of
malabar
or
coromandel
as
he
did
in
the
forests
of
new
guinea
well
sir
cant
we
manage
without
his
permission
i
didnt
answer
the
canadian
i
wanted
no
arguments
deep
down
i
was
determined
to
fully
exploit
the
good
fortune
that
had
put
me
on
board
the
nautilus
after
leaving
keeling
island
our
pace
got
generally
slower
it
also
got
more
unpredictable
often
taking
us
to
great
depths
several
times
we
used
our
slanting
fins
which
internal
levers
could
set
at
an
oblique
angle
to
our
waterline
thus
we
went
as
deep
as
two
or
three
kilometers
down
but
without
ever
verifying
the
lowest
depths
of
this
sea
near
india
which
soundings
of
13000
meters
have
been
unable
to
reach
as
for
the
temperature
in
these
lower
strata
the
thermometer
always
and
invariably
indicated
4
degrees
centigrade
i
merely
observed
that
in
the
upper
layers
the
water
was
always
colder
over
shallows
than
in
the
open
sea
on
january
25
the
ocean
being
completely
deserted
the
nautilus
spent
the
day
on
the
surface
churning
the
waves
with
its
powerful
propeller
and
making
them
spurt
to
great
heights
under
these
conditions
who
wouldnt
have
mistaken
it
for
a
gigantic
cetacean
i
spent
threequarters
of
the
day
on
the
platform
i
stared
at
the
sea
nothing
on
the
horizon
except
near
four
oclock
in
the
afternoon
a
long
steamer
to
the
west
running
on
our
opposite
tack
its
masting
was
visible
for
an
instant
but
it
couldnt
have
seen
the
nautilus
because
we
were
lying
too
low
in
the
water
i
imagine
that
steamboat
belonged
to
the
peninsular

oriental
line
which
provides
service
from
the
island
of
ceylon
to
sydney
also
calling
at
king
george
sound
and
melbourne
at
five
oclock
in
the
afternoon
just
before
that
brief
twilight
that
links
day
with
night
in
tropical
zones
conseil
and
i
marveled
at
an
unusual
sight
it
was
a
delightful
animal
whose
discovery
according
to
the
ancients
is
a
sign
of
good
luck
aristotle
athenaeus
pliny
and
oppian
studied
its
habits
and
lavished
on
its
behalf
all
the
scientific
poetry
of
greece
and
italy
they
called
it
nautilus
and
pompilius
but
modern
science
has
not
endorsed
these
designations
and
this
mollusk
is
now
known
by
the
name
argonaut
anyone
consulting
conseil
would
soon
learn
from
the
gallant
lad
that
the
branch
mollusca
is
divided
into
five
classes
that
the
first
class
features
the
cephalopoda
whose
members
are
sometimes
naked
sometimes
covered
with
a
shell
which
consists
of
two
families
the
dibranchiata
and
the
tetrabranchiata
which
are
distinguished
by
their
number
of
gills
that
the
family
dibranchiata
includes
three
genera
the
argonaut
the
squid
and
the
cuttlefish
and
that
the
family
tetrabranchiata
contains
only
one
genus
the
nautilus
after
this
catalog
if
some
recalcitrant
listener
confuses
the
argonaut
which
is
acetabuliferous
in
other
words
a
bearer
of
suction
tubes
with
the
nautilus
which
is
tentaculiferous
a
bearer
of
tentacles
it
will
be
simply
unforgivable
now
it
was
a
school
of
argonauts
then
voyaging
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
we
could
count
several
hundred
of
them
they
belonged
to
that
species
of
argonaut
covered
with
protuberances
and
exclusive
to
the
seas
near
india
these
graceful
mollusks
were
swimming
backward
by
means
of
their
locomotive
tubes
sucking
water
into
these
tubes
and
then
expelling
it
six
of
their
eight
tentacles
were
long
thin
and
floated
on
the
water
while
the
other
two
were
rounded
into
palms
and
spread
to
the
wind
like
light
sails
i
could
see
perfectly
their
undulating
spiralshaped
shells
which
cuvier
aptly
compared
to
an
elegant
cockleboat
its
an
actual
boat
indeed
it
transports
the
animal
that
secretes
it
without
the
animal
sticking
to
it
the
argonaut
is
free
to
leave
its
shell
i
told
conseil
but
it
never
does
not
unlike
captain
nemo
conseil
replied
sagely
which
is
why
he
should
have
christened
his
ship
the
argonaut
for
about
an
hour
the
nautilus
cruised
in
the
midst
of
this
school
of
mollusks
then
lord
knows
why
they
were
gripped
with
a
sudden
fear
as
if
at
a
signal
every
sail
was
abruptly
lowered
arms
folded
bodies
contracted
shells
turned
over
by
changing
their
center
of
gravity
and
the
whole
flotilla
disappeared
under
the
waves
it
was
instantaneous
and
no
squadron
of
ships
ever
maneuvered
with
greater
togetherness
just
then
night
fell
suddenly
and
the
waves
barely
surged
in
the
breeze
spreading
placidly
around
the
nautiluss
side
plates
the
next
day
january
26
we
cut
the
equator
on
the
82nd
meridian
and
we
reentered
the
northern
hemisphere
during
that
day
a
fearsome
school
of
sharks
provided
us
with
an
escort
dreadful
animals
that
teem
in
these
seas
and
make
them
extremely
dangerous
there
were
port
jackson
sharks
with
a
brown
back
a
whitish
belly
and
eleven
rows
of
teeth
bigeye
sharks
with
necks
marked
by
a
large
black
spot
encircled
in
white
and
resembling
an
eye
and
isabella
sharks
whose
rounded
snouts
were
strewn
with
dark
speckles
often
these
powerful
animals
rushed
at
the
lounge
window
with
a
violence
less
than
comforting
by
this
point
ned
land
had
lost
all
selfcontrol
he
wanted
to
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
and
harpoon
the
monsters
especially
certain
smoothhound
sharks
whose
mouths
were
paved
with
teeth
arranged
like
a
mosaic
and
some
big
fivemeter
tiger
sharks
that
insisted
on
personally
provoking
him
but
the
nautilus
soon
picked
up
speed
and
easily
left
astern
the
fastest
of
these
maneaters
on
january
27
at
the
entrance
to
the
huge
bay
of
bengal
we
repeatedly
encountered
a
gruesome
sight
human
corpses
floating
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
carried
by
the
ganges
to
the
high
seas
these
were
deceased
indian
villagers
who
hadnt
been
fully
devoured
by
vultures
the
only
morticians
in
these
parts
but
there
was
no
shortage
of
sharks
to
assist
them
with
their
undertaking
chores
near
seven
oclock
in
the
evening
the
nautilus
lay
half
submerged
navigating
in
the
midst
of
milky
white
waves
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
ocean
seemed
lactified
was
it
an
effect
of
the
moons
rays
no
because
the
new
moon
was
barely
two
days
old
and
was
still
lost
below
the
horizon
in
the
suns
rays
the
entire
sky
although
lit
up
by
stellar
radiation
seemed
pitchblack
in
comparison
with
the
whiteness
of
these
waters
conseil
couldnt
believe
his
eyes
and
he
questioned
me
about
the
causes
of
this
odd
phenomenon
luckily
i
was
in
a
position
to
answer
him
thats
called
a
milk
sea
i
told
him
a
vast
expanse
of
white
waves
often
seen
along
the
coasts
of
amboina
and
in
these
waterways
but
conseil
asked
could
master
tell
me
the
cause
of
this
effect
because
i
presume
this
water
hasnt
really
changed
into
milk
no
my
boy
and
this
whiteness
that
amazes
you
is
merely
due
to
the
presence
of
myriads
of
tiny
creatures
called
infusoria
a
sort
of
diminutive
glowworm
thats
colorless
and
gelatinous
in
appearance
as
thick
as
a
strand
of
hair
and
no
longer
than
onefifth
of
a
millimeter
some
of
these
tiny
creatures
stick
together
over
an
area
of
several
leagues
several
leagues
conseil
exclaimed
yes
my
boy
and
dont
even
try
to
compute
the
number
of
these
infusoria
you
wont
pull
it
off
because
if
im
not
mistaken
certain
navigators
have
cruised
through
milk
seas
for
more
than
forty
miles
im
not
sure
that
conseil
heeded
my
recommendation
because
he
seemed
to
be
deep
in
thought
no
doubt
trying
to
calculate
how
many
onefifths
of
a
millimeter
are
found
in
forty
square
miles
as
for
me
i
continued
to
observe
this
phenomenon
for
several
hours
the
nautiluss
spur
sliced
through
these
whitish
waves
and
i
watched
it
glide
noiselessly
over
this
soapy
water
as
if
it
were
cruising
through
those
foaming
eddies
that
a
bays
currents
and
countercurrents
sometimes
leave
between
each
other
near
midnight
the
sea
suddenly
resumed
its
usual
hue
but
behind
us
all
the
way
to
the
horizon
the
skies
kept
mirroring
the
whiteness
of
those
waves
and
for
a
good
while
seemed
imbued
with
the
hazy
glow
of
an
aurora
borealis

a
new
proposition
from
captain
nemo
on
january
28
in
latitude
9
degrees
4
north
when
the
nautilus
returned
at
noon
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
it
lay
in
sight
of
land
some
eight
miles
to
the
west
right
off
i
observed
a
cluster
of
mountains
about
2000
feet
high
whose
shapes
were
very
whimsically
sculpted
after
our
position
fix
i
reentered
the
lounge
and
when
our
bearings
were
reported
on
the
chart
i
saw
that
we
were
off
the
island
of
ceylon
that
pearl
dangling
from
the
lower
lobe
of
the
indian
peninsula
i
went
looking
in
the
library
for
a
book
about
this
island
one
of
the
most
fertile
in
the
world
sure
enough
i
found
a
volume
entitled
ceylon
and
the
singhalese
by
h
c
sirr
esq
reentering
the
lounge
i
first
noted
the
bearings
of
ceylon
on
which
antiquity
lavished
so
many
different
names
it
was
located
between
latitude
5
degrees
55
and
9
degrees
49
north
and
between
longitude
79
degrees
42
and
82
degrees
4
east
of
the
meridian
of
greenwich
its
length
is
275
miles
its
maximum
width
150
miles
its
circumference
900
miles
its
surface
area
24448
square
miles
in
other
words
a
little
smaller
than
that
of
ireland
just
then
captain
nemo
and
his
chief
officer
appeared
the
captain
glanced
at
the
chart
then
turning
to
me
the
island
of
ceylon
he
said
is
famous
for
its
pearl
fisheries
would
you
be
interested
professor
aronnax
in
visiting
one
of
those
fisheries
certainly
captain
fine
its
easily
done
only
when
we
see
the
fisheries
well
see
no
fishermen
the
annual
harvest
hasnt
yet
begun
no
matter
ill
give
orders
to
make
for
the
gulf
of
mannar
and
well
arrive
there
late
tonight
the
captain
said
a
few
words
to
his
chief
officer
who
went
out
immediately
soon
the
nautilus
reentered
its
liquid
element
and
the
pressure
gauge
indicated
that
it
was
staying
at
a
depth
of
thirty
feet
with
the
chart
under
my
eyes
i
looked
for
the
gulf
of
mannar
i
found
it
by
the
9th
parallel
off
the
northwestern
shores
of
ceylon
it
was
formed
by
the
long
curve
of
little
mannar
island
to
reach
it
we
had
to
go
all
the
way
up
ceylons
west
coast
professor
captain
nemo
then
told
me
there
are
pearl
fisheries
in
the
bay
of
bengal
the
seas
of
the
east
indies
the
seas
of
china
and
japan
plus
those
seas
south
of
the
united
states
the
gulf
of
panama
and
the
gulf
of
california
but
its
off
ceylon
that
such
fishing
reaps
its
richest
rewards
no
doubt
well
be
arriving
a
little
early
fishermen
gather
in
the
gulf
of
mannar
only
during
the
month
of
march
and
for
thirty
days
some
300
boats
concentrate
on
the
lucrative
harvest
of
these
treasures
from
the
sea
each
boat
is
manned
by
ten
oarsmen
and
ten
fishermen
the
latter
divide
into
two
groups
dive
in
rotation
and
descend
to
a
depth
of
twelve
meters
with
the
help
of
a
heavy
stone
clutched
between
their
feet
and
attached
by
a
rope
to
their
boat
you
mean
i
said
that
such
primitive
methods
are
still
all
that
they
use
all
captain
nemo
answered
me
although
these
fisheries
belong
to
the
most
industrialized
people
in
the
world
the
english
to
whom
the
treaty
of
amiens
granted
them
in
1802
yet
it
strikes
me
that
diving
suits
like
yours
could
perform
yeoman
service
in
such
work
yes
since
those
poor
fishermen
cant
stay
long
underwater
on
his
voyage
to
ceylon
the
englishman
percival
made
much
of
a
kaffir
who
stayed
under
five
minutes
without
coming
up
to
the
surface
but
i
find
that
hard
to
believe
i
know
that
some
divers
can
last
up
to
fiftyseven
seconds
and
highly
skillful
ones
to
eightyseven
but
such
men
are
rare
and
when
the
poor
fellows
climb
back
on
board
the
water
coming
out
of
their
noses
and
ears
is
tinted
with
blood
i
believe
the
average
time
underwater
that
these
fishermen
can
tolerate
is
thirty
seconds
during
which
they
hastily
stuff
their
little
nets
with
all
the
pearl
oysters
they
can
tear
loose
but
these
fishermen
generally
dont
live
to
advanced
age
their
vision
weakens
ulcers
break
out
on
their
eyes
sores
form
on
their
bodies
and
some
are
even
stricken
with
apoplexy
on
the
ocean
floor
yes
i
said
its
a
sad
occupation
and
one
that
exists
only
to
gratify
the
whims
of
fashion
but
tell
me
captain
how
many
oysters
can
a
boat
fish
up
in
a
workday
about
40000
to
50000
its
even
said
that
in
1814
when
the
english
government
went
fishing
on
its
own
behalf
its
divers
worked
just
twenty
days
and
brought
up
76000000
oysters
at
least
i
asked
the
fishermen
are
well
paid
arent
they
hardly
professor
in
panama
they
make
just
100
per
week
in
most
places
they
earn
only
a
penny
for
each
oyster
that
has
a
pearl
and
they
bring
up
so
many
that
have
none
only
one
penny
to
those
poor
people
who
make
their
employers
rich
thats
atrocious
on
that
note
professor
captain
nemo
told
me
you
and
your
companions
will
visit
the
mannar
oysterbank
and
if
by
chance
some
eager
fisherman
arrives
early
well
we
can
watch
him
at
work
that
suits
me
captain
by
the
way
professor
aronnax
you
arent
afraid
of
sharks
are
you
sharks
i
exclaimed
this
struck
me
as
a
pretty
needless
question
to
say
the
least
well
captain
nemo
went
on
i
admit
captain
im
not
yet
on
very
familiar
terms
with
that
genus
of
fish
were
used
to
them
the
rest
of
us
captain
nemo
answered
and
in
time
you
will
be
too
anyhow
well
be
armed
and
on
our
way
we
might
hunt
a
maneater
or
two
its
a
fascinating
sport
so
professor
ill
see
you
tomorrow
bright
and
early
this
said
in
a
carefree
tone
captain
nemo
left
the
lounge
if
youre
invited
to
hunt
bears
in
the
swiss
mountains
you
might
say
oh
good
i
get
to
go
bear
hunting
tomorrow
if
youre
invited
to
hunt
lions
on
the
atlas
plains
or
tigers
in
the
jungles
of
india
you
might
say
ha
nows
my
chance
to
hunt
lions
and
tigers
but
if
youre
invited
to
hunt
sharks
in
their
native
element
you
might
want
to
think
it
over
before
accepting
as
for
me
i
passed
a
hand
over
my
brow
where
beads
of
cold
sweat
were
busy
forming
lets
think
this
over
i
said
to
myself
and
lets
take
our
time
hunting
otters
in
underwater
forests
as
we
did
in
the
forests
of
crespo
island
is
an
acceptable
activity
but
to
roam
the
bottom
of
the
sea
when
youre
almost
certain
to
meet
maneaters
in
the
neighborhood
thats
another
story
i
know
that
in
certain
countries
particularly
the
andaman
islands
negroes
dont
hesitate
to
attack
sharks
dagger
in
one
hand
and
noose
in
the
other
but
i
also
know
that
many
who
face
those
fearsome
animals
dont
come
back
alive
besides
im
not
a
negro
and
even
if
i
were
a
negro
in
this
instance
i
dont
think
a
little
hesitation
on
my
part
would
be
out
of
place
and
there
i
was
fantasizing
about
sharks
envisioning
huge
jaws
armed
with
multiple
rows
of
teeth
and
capable
of
cutting
a
man
in
half
i
could
already
feel
a
definite
pain
around
my
pelvic
girdle
and
how
i
resented
the
offhand
manner
in
which
the
captain
had
extended
his
deplorable
invitation
you
would
have
thought
it
was
an
issue
of
going
into
the
woods
on
some
harmless
fox
hunt
thank
heavens
i
said
to
myself
conseil
will
never
want
to
come
along
and
thatll
be
my
excuse
for
not
going
with
the
captain
as
for
ned
land
i
admit
i
felt
less
confident
of
his
wisdom
danger
however
great
held
a
perennial
attraction
for
his
aggressive
nature
i
went
back
to
reading
sirrs
book
but
i
leafed
through
it
mechanically
between
the
lines
i
kept
seeing
fearsome
wideopen
jaws
just
then
conseil
and
the
canadian
entered
with
a
calm
even
gleeful
air
little
did
they
know
what
was
waiting
for
them
ye
gods
sir
ned
land
told
me
your
captain
nemothe
devil
take
himhas
just
made
us
a
very
pleasant
proposition
oh
i
said
you
know
about
with
all
due
respect
to
master
conseil
replied
the
nautiluss
commander
has
invited
us
together
with
master
for
a
visit
tomorrow
to
ceylons
magnificent
pearl
fisheries
he
did
so
in
the
most
cordial
terms
and
conducted
himself
like
a
true
gentleman
he
didnt
tell
you
anything
else
nothing
sir
the
canadian
replied
he
said
youd
already
discussed
this
little
stroll
indeed
i
said
but
didnt
he
give
you
any
details
on
not
a
one
mr
naturalist
you
will
be
going
with
us
right
me
why
yes
certainly
of
course
i
can
see
that
you
like
the
idea
mr
land
yes
it
will
be
a
really
unusual
experience
and
possibly
dangerous
i
added
in
an
insinuating
tone
dangerous
ned
land
replied
a
simple
trip
to
an
oysterbank
assuredly
captain
nemo
hadnt
seen
fit
to
plant
the
idea
of
sharks
in
the
minds
of
my
companions
for
my
part
i
stared
at
them
with
anxious
eyes
as
if
they
were
already
missing
a
limb
or
two
should
i
alert
them
yes
surely
but
i
hardly
knew
how
to
go
about
it
would
master
conseil
said
to
me
give
us
some
background
on
pearl
fishing
on
the
fishing
itself
i
asked
or
on
the
occupational
hazards
that
on
the
fishing
the
canadian
replied
before
we
tackle
the
terrain
it
helps
to
be
familiar
with
it
all
right
sit
down
my
friends
and
ill
teach
you
everything
i
myself
have
just
been
taught
by
the
englishman
h
c
sirr
ned
and
conseil
took
seats
on
a
couch
and
right
off
the
canadian
said
to
me
sir
just
what
is
a
pearl
exactly
my
gallant
ned
i
replied
for
poets
a
pearl
is
a
tear
from
the
sea
for
orientals
its
a
drop
of
solidified
dew
for
the
ladies
its
a
jewel
they
can
wear
on
their
fingers
necks
and
ears
thats
oblong
in
shape
glassy
in
luster
and
formed
from
motherofpearl
for
chemists
its
a
mixture
of
calcium
phosphate
and
calcium
carbonate
with
a
little
gelatin
protein
and
finally
for
naturalists
its
a
simple
festering
secretion
from
the
organ
that
produces
motherofpearl

certain
bivalves

my

now
then
those

of

well
pay
closer

i
went
on

simply
from
motherofpearl
solidifying
into
a
globular
shape
either
they
stick
to
the
oysters
shell
or
they
become
embedded
in
the
creatures
folds
on
the
valves
a
pearl
sticks
fast
on
the
flesh
it
lies
loose
but
its
nucleus
is
always
some
small
hard
object
say
a
sterile
egg
or
a
grain
of
sand
around
which
the
motherofpearl
is
deposited
in
thin
concentric
layers
over
several
years
in
succession
can
one
find
several
pearls
in
the
same
oyster
conseil
asked
yes
my
boy
there
are
some
shellfish
that
turn
into
real
jewel
coffers
they
even
mention
one
oyster
about
which
i
remain
dubious
that
supposedly
contained
at
least
150
sharks
150
sharks

yelped
did
i
say
sharks
i
exclaimed
hastily
i
meant
150
pearls
sharks
wouldnt
make
sense
indeed
conseil
said
but
will
master
now
tell
us
how
one
goes
about
extracting
these
pearls
one
proceeds
in
several
ways
and
often
when
pearls
stick
to
the
valves
fishermen
even
pull
them
loose
with
pliers
but
usually
the
shellfish
are
spread
out
on
mats
made
from
the
esparto
grass
that
covers
the
beaches
thus
they
die
in
the
open
air
and
by
the
end
of
ten
days
theyve
rotted
sufficiently
next
theyre
immersed
in
huge
tanks
of
salt
water
then
theyre
opened
up
and
washed
at
this
point
the
sorters
begin
their
twofold
task
first
they
remove
the
layers
of
motherofpearl
which
are
known
in
the
industry
by
the
names
legitimate
silver
bastard
white
or
bastard
black
and
these
are
shipped
out
in
cases
weighing
125
to
150
kilograms
then
they
remove
the
oysters
meaty
tissue
boil
it
and
finally
strain
it
in
order
to
extract
even
the
smallest
pearls
do
the
prices
of
these
pearls
differ
depending
on
their
size
conseil
asked
not
only
on
their
size
i
replied
but
also
according
to
their
shape
their
waterin
other
words
their
colorand
their
orientin
other
words
that
dappled
shimmering
glow
that
makes
them
so
delightful
to
the
eye
the
finest
pearls
are
called
virgin
pearls
or
paragons
they
form
in
isolation
within
the
mollusks
tissue
theyre
white
often
opaque
but
sometimes
of
opalescent
transparency
and
usually
spherical
or
pearshaped
the
spherical
ones
are
made
into
bracelets
the
pearshaped
ones
into
earrings
and
since
theyre
the
most
valuable
theyre
priced
individually
the
other
pearls
that
stick
to
the
oysters
shell
are
more
erratically
shaped
and
are
priced
by
weight
finally
classed
in
the
lowest
order
the
smallest
pearls
are
known
by
the
name
seed
pearls
theyre
priced
by
the
measuring
cup
and
are
used
mainly
in
the
creation
of
embroidery
for
church
vestments
but
it
must
be
a
long
hard
job
sorting
out
these
pearls
by
size
the
canadian
said
no
my
friend
that
task
is
performed
with
eleven
strainers
or
sieves
that
are
pierced
with
different
numbers
of
holes
those
pearls
staying
in
the
strainers
with
twenty
to
eighty
holes
are
in
the
first
order
those
not
slipping
through
the
sieves
pierced
with
100
to
800
holes
are
in
the
second
order
finally
those
pearls
for
which
one
uses
strainers
pierced
with
900
to
1000
holes
make
up
the
seed
pearls
how
ingenious
conseil
said
to
reduce
dividing
and
classifying
pearls
to
a
mechanical
operation
and
could
master
tell
us
the
profits
brought
in
by
harvesting
these
banks
of
pearl
oysters
according
to
sirrs
book
i
replied
these
ceylon
fisheries
are
farmed
annually
for
a
total
profit
of
3000000
maneaters
francs
conseil
rebuked
yes
francs
3000000
francs
i
went
on
but
i
dont
think
these
fisheries
bring
in
the
returns
they
once
did
similarly
the
central
american
fisheries
used
to
make
an
annual
profit
of
4000000
francs
during
the
reign
of
king
charles
v
but
now
they
bring
in
only
twothirds
of
that
amount
all
in
all
its
estimated
that
9000000
francs
is
the
current
yearly
return
for
the
whole
pearlharvesting
industry
but
conseil
asked
havent
certain
famous
pearls
been
quoted
at
extremely
high
prices
yes
my
boy
they
say
julius
caesar
gave
servilia
a
pearl
worth
120000
francs
in
our
currency
ive
even
heard
stories
the
canadian
said
about
some
lady
in
ancient
times
who
drank
pearls
in
vinegar
cleopatra
conseil
shot
back
it
must
have
tasted
pretty
bad
ned
land
added
abominable
ned
my
friend
conseil
replied
but
when
a
little
glass
of
vinegar
is
worth
1500000
francs
its
taste
is
a
small
price
to
pay
im
sorry
i
didnt
marry
the
gal
the
canadian
said
throwing
up
his
hands
with
an
air
of
discouragement
ned
land
married
to
cleopatra
conseil
exclaimed
but
i
was
all
set
to
tie
the
knot
conseil
the
canadian
replied
in
all
seriousness
and
it
wasnt
my
fault
the
whole
business
fell
through
i
even
bought
a
pearl
necklace
for
my
fiance
kate
tender
but
she
married
somebody
else
instead
well
that
necklace
cost
me
only
150
but
you
can
absolutely
trust
me
on
this
professor
its
pearls
were
so
big
they
wouldnt
have
gone
through
that
strainer
with
twenty
holes
my
gallant
ned
i
replied
laughing
those
were
artificial
pearls
ordinary
glass
beads
whose
insides
were
coated
with
essence
of
orient
wow
the
canadian
replied
that
essence
of
orient
must
sell
for
quite
a
large
sum
as
little
as
zero
it
comes
from
the
scales
of
a
european
carp
its
nothing
more
than
a
silver
substance
that
collects
in
the
water
and
is
preserved
in
ammonia
its
worthless
maybe
thats
why
kate
tender
married
somebody
else
replied
mr
land
philosophically
but
i
said
getting
back
to
pearls
of
great
value
i
dont
think
any
sovereign
ever
possessed
one
superior
to
the
pearl
owned
by
captain
nemo
this
one
conseil
said
pointing
to
a
magnificent
jewel
in
its
glass
case
exactly
and
im
certainly
not
far
off
when
i
estimate
its
value
at
2000000



uh



francs
conseil
said
quickly
yes
i
said
2000000
francs
and
no
doubt
all
it
cost
our
captain
was
the
effort
to
pick
it
up
ha
ned
land
exclaimed
during
our
stroll
tomorrow
who
says
we
wont
run
into
one
just
like
it
bah
conseil
put
in
and
why
not
what
good
would
a
pearl
worth
millions
do
us
here
on
the
nautilus
here
no
ned
land
said
but
elsewhere



oh
elsewhere
conseil
put
in
shaking
his
head
in
fact
i
said
mr
land
is
right
and
if
we
ever
brought
back
to
europe
or
america
a
pearl
worth
millions
it
would
make
the
story
of
our
adventures
more
authenticand
much
more
rewarding
thats
how
i
see
it
the
canadian
said
but
said
conseil
who
perpetually
returned
to
the
didactic
side
of
things
is
this
pearl
fishing
ever
dangerous
no
i
replied
quickly
especially
if
one
takes
certain
precautions
what
risks
would
you
run
in
a
job
like
that
ned
land
said
swallowing
a
few
gulps
of
salt
water
whatever
you
say
ned
then
trying
to
imitate
captain
nemos
carefree
tone
i
asked
by
the
way
gallant
ned
are
you
afraid
of
sharks
me
the
canadian
replied
im
a
professional
harpooner
its
my
job
to
make
a
mockery
of
them
it
isnt
an
issue
i
said
of
fishing
for
them
with
a
swivel
hook
hoisting
them
onto
the
deck
of
a
ship
chopping
off
the
tail
with
a
sweep
of
the
ax
opening
the
belly
ripping
out
the
heart
and
tossing
it
into
the
sea
so
its
an
issue
of




yes
precisely
in
the
water
in
the
water
ye
gods
just
give
me
a
good
harpoon
you
see
sir
these
sharks
are
badly
designed
they
have
to
roll
their
bellies
over
to
snap
you
up
and
in
the
meantime



ned
land
had
a
way
of
pronouncing
the
word
snap
that
sent
chills
down
the
spine
well
how
about
you
conseil
what
are
your
feelings
about
these
maneaters
me
conseil
said
im
afraid
i
must
be
frank
with
master
good
for
you
i
thought
if
master
faces
these
sharks
conseil
said
i
think
his
loyal
manservant
should
face
them
with
him

to
bed
i
slept
pretty
poorly
maneaters
played
a
major
role
in
my
dreams
and
i
found
it
more
or
less
appropriate
that
the
french
word
for
shark
requin
has
its
linguistic
roots
in
the
word
requiem
the
next
day
at
four
oclock
in
the
morning
i
was
awakened
by
the
steward
whom
captain
nemo
had
placed
expressly
at
my
service
i
got
up
quickly
dressed
and
went
into
the
lounge
captain

was
waiting
for

said
to
me
are
you
ready
to
start
im
ready
kindly
follow
me
what
about
my
companions
captain
theyve
been
alerted
and
are
waiting
for
us
arent
we
going
to
put
on
our
diving
suits
i
asked
not
yet
i
havent
let
the
nautilus
pull
too
near
the
coast
and
were
fairly
well
out
from
the
mannar
oysterbank
but
i
have
the
skiff
ready
and
it
will
take
us
to
the
exact
spot
where
well
disembark
which
will
save
us
a
pretty
long
trek

and
well

up
just
before
we
begin
our
underwater
exploring
captain

took
me
to
the
central
companionway
whose
steps
led
to

were
there

in

five
of
the
nautiluss
sailors
were
waiting
for
us
aboard
the
skiff
which
was
moored
alongside
the
night
was
still
dark
layers
of
clouds
cloaked
the
sky
and
left
only
a
few
stars
in
view
my
eyes
flew
to
the
side
where
land
lay
but
i
saw
only
a
blurred
line
covering
threequarters
of
the
horizon
from
southwest
to
northwest
going
up
ceylons
west
coast
during
the
night
the

lay
west
of
the

or
rather
that
gulf
formed
by
the
mainland
and

under
these
dark
waters
there
stretched
the

than
twenty

long
captain

and
i
found
seats
in
the
stern
of
the
skiff
the
longboats
coxswain
took
the
tiller
his
four
companions
leaned
into
their
oars
the
moorings
were
cast
off
and
we
pulled
clear
the
skiff
headed
southward
the
oarsmen
took
their
time
i
watched
their
strokes
vigorously
catch
the
water
and
they
always
waited
ten
seconds
before
rowing
again
following
the
practice
used
in
most
navies
while
the
longboat
coasted
drops
of
liquid
flicked
from
the
oars
and
hit
the
dark
troughs
of
the

pitterpattering
like
splashes
of
molten
lead
coming
from

a
mild
swell
made
the

roll
gently
and
a
few
cresting
billows
lapped
at
its
bow
we
were
silent
what
was
captain
nemo
thinking
perhaps
that
this
approaching
shore
was
too
close
for
comfort
contrary
to
the
canadians
views
in
which
it
still
seemed
too
far
away
as
for
conseil

had
come
along
out
of
simple
curiosity

the
upper
lines
of
the

with
greater
distinctness
fairly
flat
to
the
east
it
swelled
a
little
toward
the
south
five
miles
still
separated
it
from
us
and
its
beach
merged
with
the
misty
waters
between
us
and
the
shore
the

was
deserted
not

not

profound
solitude
reigned
over
this

of

as
captain

had
commented
we
were
arriving
in
these

a
month
too
soon
at
six
oclock
the
day
broke
suddenly
with
that
speed
unique
to
tropical
regions

pierced
the

curtain
gathered
on
the
easterly
horizon
and
the
radiant
orb
rose
swiftly
i
could
clearly
see
the
shore
which
featured
a
few
sparse
trees
here
and
there
the
skiff
advanced
toward
mannar
island
which
curved
to
the
south
captain
nemo
stood
up
from
his
thwart
and
studied
the
sea
at
his
signal
the
anchor
was
lowered
but
its
chain
barely
ran
because
the
bottom
lay
no
more
than
a
meter
down
and
this
locality
was
one
of
the
shallowest
spots
near
the
bank
of
shellfish
instantly
the
skiff
wheeled
around
under
the
ebb
tides
outbound
thrust
here
we
are
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
then
said
you
observe
this
confined
bay
a
month
from
now
in
this
very
place
the
numerous
fishing
boats
of
the
harvesters
will
gather
and
these
are
the
waters
their
divers
will
ransack
so
daringly
this
bay
is
felicitously
laid
out
for
their
type
of
fishing
its
sheltered
from
the
strongest
winds
and
the
sea
is
never
very
turbulent
here
highly
favorable
conditions
for
diving
work
now
lets
put
on
our
underwater
suits
and
well
begin
our
stroll
i
didnt
reply
and
while
staring
at
these
suspicious
waves
i
began
to
put
on
my
heavy
aquatic
clothes
helped
by
the
longboats
sailors
captain
nemo
and
my
two
companions
suited
up
as
well
none
of
the
nautiluss
men
were
to
go
with
us
on
this
new
excursion
soon
we
were
imprisoned
up
to
the
neck
in
indiarubber
clothing
and
straps
fastened
the
air
devices
onto
our
backs
as
for
the
ruhmkorff
device
it
didnt
seem
to
be
in
the
picture
before
inserting
my
head
into
its
copper
capsule
i
commented
on
this
to
the
captain
our
lighting
equipment
would
be
useless
to
us
the
captain
answered
me
we
wont
be
going
very
deep
and
the
suns
rays
will
be
sufficient
to
light
our
way
besides
its
unwise
to
carry
electric
lanterns
under
these
waves
their
brightness
might
unexpectedly
attract
certain
dangerous
occupants
of
these
waterways
as
captain
nemo
pronounced
these
words
i
turned
to
conseil
and
ned
land
but
my
two
friends
had
already
encased
their
craniums
in
their
metal
headgear
and
they
could
neither
hear
nor
reply
i
had
one
question
left
to
address
to
captain
nemo
what
about
our
weapons
i
asked
him
our
rifles
rifles
what
for
dont
your
mountaineers
attack
bears
dagger
in
hand
and
isnt
steel
surer
than
lead
heres
a
sturdy
blade
slip
it
under
your
belt
and
lets
be
off
i
stared
at
my
companions
they
were
armed
in
the
same
fashion
and
ned
land
was
also
brandishing
an
enormous
harpoon
he
had
stowed
in
the
skiff
before
leaving
the
nautilus
then
following
the
captains
example
i
let
myself
be
crowned
with
my
heavy
copper
sphere
and
our
air
tanks
immediately
went
into
action
an
instant
later
the
longboats
sailors
helped
us
overboard
one
after
the
other
and
we
set
foot
on
level
sand
in
a
meter
and
a
half
of
water
captain
nemo
gave
us
a
hand
signal
we
followed
him
down
a
gentle
slope
and
disappeared
under
the
waves
there
the
obsessive
fears
in
my
brain
left
me
i
became
surprisingly
calm
again
the
ease
with
which
i
could
move
increased
my
confidence
and
the
many
strange
sights
captivated
my
imagination
the
sun
was
already
sending
sufficient
light
under
these
waves
the
tiniest
objects
remained
visible
after
ten
minutes
of
walking
we
were
in
five
meters
of
water
and
the
terrain
had
become
almost
flat
like
a
covey
of
snipe
over
a
marsh
there
rose
underfoot
schools
of
unusual
fish
from
the
genus
monopterus
whose
members
have
no
fin
but
their
tail
i
recognized
the
javanese
eel
a
genuine
eightdecimeter
serpent
with
a
bluish
gray
belly
which
without
the
gold
lines
over
its
flanks
could
easily
be
confused
with
the
conger
eel
from
the
butterfish
genus
whose
oval
bodies
are
very
flat
i
observed
several
adorned
in
brilliant
colors
and
sporting
a
dorsal
fin
like
a
sickle
edible
fish
that
when
dried
and
marinated
make
an
excellent
dish
known
by
the
name
karawade
then
some
sea
poachers
fish
belonging
to
the
genus
aspidophoroides
whose
bodies
are
covered
with
scaly
armor
divided
into
eight
lengthwise
sections
meanwhile
as
the
sun
got
progressively
higher
it
lit
up
the
watery
mass
more
and
more
the
seafloor
changed
little
by
little
its
finegrained
sand
was
followed
by
a
genuine
causeway
of
smooth
crags
covered
by
a
carpet
of
mollusks
and
zoophytes
among
other
specimens
in
these
two
branches
i
noted
some
windowpane
oysters
with
thin
valves
of
unequal
size
a
type
of
ostracod
unique
to
the
red
sea
and
the
indian
ocean
then
orangehued
lucina
with
circular
shells
awlshaped
auger
shells
some
of
those
persian
murex
snails
that
supply
the
nautilus
with
such
wonderful
dye
spiky
periwinkles
fifteen
centimeters
long
that
rose
under
the
waves
like
hands
ready
to
grab
you
turban
snails
with
shells
made
of
horn
and
bristling
all
over
with
spines
lamp
shells
edible
duck
clams
that
feed
the
hindu
marketplace
subtly
luminous
jellyfish
of
the
species
pelagia
panopyra
and
finally
some
wonderful
oculina
flabelliforma
magnificent
sea
fans
that
fashion
one
of
the
most
luxuriant
tree
forms
in
this
ocean
in
the
midst
of
this
moving
vegetation
under
arbors
of
water
plants
there
raced
legions
of
clumsy
articulates
in
particular
some
fanged
frog
crabs
whose
carapaces
form
a
slightly
rounded
triangle
robber
crabs
exclusive
to
these
waterways
and
horrible
parthenope
crabs
whose
appearance
was
repulsive
to
the
eye
one
animal
no
less
hideous
which
i
encountered
several
times
was
the
enormous
crab
that
mr
darwin
observed
to
which
nature
has
given
the
instinct
and
requisite
strength
to
eat
coconuts
it
scrambles
up
trees
on
the
beach
and
sends
the
coconuts
tumbling
they
fracture
in
their
fall
and
are
opened
by
its
powerful
pincers
here
under
these
clear
waves
this
crab
raced
around
with
matchless
agility
while
green
turtles
from
the
species
frequenting
the
malabar
coast
moved
sluggishly
among
the
crumbling
rocks
near
seven
oclock
we
finally
surveyed
the
bank
of
shellfish
where
pearl
oysters
reproduce
by
the
millions
these
valuable
mollusks
stick
to
rocks
where
theyre
strongly
attached
by
a
mass
of
brown
filaments
that
forbids
their
moving
about
in
this
respect
oysters
are
inferior
even
to
mussels
to
whom
nature
has
not
denied
all
talent
for
locomotion
the
shellfish
meleagrina
that
womb
for
pearls
whose
valves
are
nearly
equal
in
size
has
the
shape
of
a
round
shell
with
thick
walls
and
a
very
rough
exterior
some
of
these
shells
were
furrowed
with
flaky
greenish
bands
that
radiated
down
from
the
top
these
were
the
young
oysters
the
others
had
rugged
black
surfaces
measured
up
to
fifteen
centimeters
in
width
and
were
ten
or
more
years
old
captain
nemo
pointed
to
this
prodigious
heap
of
shellfish
and
i
saw
that
these
mines
were
genuinely
inexhaustible
since
natures
creative
powers
are
greater
than
mans
destructive
instincts
true
to
those
instincts
ned
land
greedily
stuffed
the
finest
of
these
mollusks
into
a
net
he
carried
at
his
side
but
we
couldnt
stop
we
had
to
follow
the
captain
who
headed
down
trails
seemingly
known
only
to
himself
the
seafloor
rose
noticeably
and
when
i
lifted
my
arms
sometimes
they
would
pass
above
the
surface
of
the
sea
then
the
level
of
the
oysterbank
would
lower
unpredictably
often
we
went
around
tall
pointed
rocks
rising
like
pyramids
in
their
dark
crevices
huge
crustaceans
aiming
their
long
legs
like
heavy
artillery
watched
us
with
unblinking
eyes
while
underfoot
there
crept
millipedes
bloodworms
aricia
worms
and
annelid
worms
whose
antennas
and
tubular
tentacles
were
incredibly
long
just
then
a
huge
cave
opened
up
in
our
path
hollowed
from
a
picturesque
pile
of
rocks
whose
smooth
heights
were
completely
hung
with
underwater
flora
at
first
this
cave
looked
pitchblack
to
me
inside
the
suns
rays
seemed
to
diminish
by
degrees
their
hazy
transparency
was
nothing
more
than
drowned
light
captain
nemo
went
in
we
followed
him
my
eyes
soon
grew
accustomed
to
this
comparative
gloom
i
distinguished
the
unpredictably
contoured
springings
of
a
vault
supported
by
natural
pillars
firmly
based
on
a
granite
foundation
like
the
weighty
columns
of
tuscan
architecture
why
had
our
incomprehensible
guide
taken
us
into
the
depths
of
this
underwater
crypt
i
would
soon
find
out
after
going
down
a
fairly
steep
slope
our
feet
trod
the
floor
of
a
sort
of
circular
pit
there
captain
nemo
stopped
and
his
hand
indicated
an
object
that
i
hadnt
yet
noticed
it
was
an
oyster
of
extraordinary
dimensions
a
titanic
giant
clam
a
holywater
font
that
could
have
held
a
whole
lake
a
basin
more
than
two
meters
wide
hence
even
bigger
than
the
one
adorning
the
nautiluss
lounge
i
approached
this
phenomenal
mollusk
its
mass
of
filaments
attached
it
to
a
table
of
granite
and
there
it
grew
by
itself
in
the
midst
of
the
caves
calm
waters
i
estimated
the
weight
of
this
giant
clam
at
300
kilograms
hence
such
an
oyster
held
fifteen
kilos
of
meat
and
youd
need
the
stomach
of
king
gargantua
to
eat
a
couple
dozen
captain
nemo
was
obviously
familiar
with
this
bivalves
existence
this
wasnt
the
first
time
hed
paid
it
a
visit
and
i
thought
his
sole
reason
for
leading
us
to
this
locality
was
to
show
us
a
natural
curiosity
i
was
mistaken
captain
nemo
had
an
explicit
personal
interest
in
checking
on
the
current
condition
of
this
giant
clam
the
mollusks
two
valves
were
partly
open
the
captain
approached
and
stuck
his
dagger
vertically
between
the
shells
to
discourage
any
ideas
about
closing
then
with
his
hands
he
raised
the
fringed
membranefilled
tunic
that
made
up
the
animals
mantle
there
between
its
leaflike
folds
i
saw
a
loose
pearl
as
big
as
a
coconut
its
globular
shape
perfect
clarity
and
wonderful
orient
made
it
a
jewel
of
incalculable
value
carried
away
by
curiosity
i
stretched
out
my
hand
to
take
it
weigh
it
fondle
it
but
the
captain
stopped
me
signaled
no
removed
his
dagger
in
one
swift
motion
and
let
the
two
valves
snap
shut
i
then
understood
captain
nemos
intent
by
leaving
the
pearl
buried
beneath
the
giant
clams
mantle
he
allowed
it
to
grow
imperceptibly
with
each
passing
year
the
mollusks
secretions
added
new
concentric
layers
the
captain
alone
was
familiar
with
the
cave
where
this
wonderful
fruit
of
nature
was
ripening
he
alone
reared
it
so
to
speak
in
order
to
transfer
it
one
day
to
his
dearly
beloved
museum
perhaps
following
the
examples
of
oyster
farmers
in
china
and
india
he
had
even
predetermined
the
creation
of
this
pearl
by
sticking
under
the
mollusks
folds
some
piece
of
glass
or
metal
that
was
gradually
covered
with
motherofpearl
in
any
case
comparing
this
pearl
to
others
i
already
knew
about
and
to
those
shimmering
in
the
captains
collection
i
estimated
that
it
was
worth
at
least
10000000
francs
it
was
a
superb
natural
curiosity
rather
than
a
luxurious
piece
of
jewelry
because
i
dont
know
of
any
female
ear
that
could
handle
it
our
visit
to
this
opulent
giant
clam
came
to
an
end
captain
nemo
left
the
cave
and
we
climbed
back
up
the
bank
of
shellfish
in
the
midst
of
these
clear
waters
not
yet
disturbed
by
divers
at
work
we
walked
by
ourselves
genuine
loiterers
stopping
or
straying
as
our
fancies
dictated
for
my
part
i
was
no
longer
worried
about
those
dangers
my
imagination
had
so
ridiculously
exaggerated
the
shallows
drew
noticeably
closer
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
soon
walking
in
only
a
meter
of
water
my
head
passed
well
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
conseil
rejoined
me
and
gluing
his
huge
copper
capsule
to
mine
his
eyes
gave
me
a
friendly
greeting
but
this
lofty
plateau
measured
only
a
few
fathoms
and
soon
we
reentered
our
element
i
think
ive
now
earned
the
right
to
dub
it
that
ten
minutes
later
captain
nemo
stopped
suddenly
i
thought
hed
called
a
halt
so
that
we
could
turn
and
start
back
no
with
a
gesture
he
ordered
us
to
crouch
beside
him
at
the
foot
of
a
wide
crevice
his
hand
motioned
toward
a
spot
within
the
liquid
mass
and
i
looked
carefully
five
meters
away
a
shadow
appeared
and
dropped
to
the
seafloor
the
alarming
idea
of
sharks
crossed
my
mind
but
i
was
mistaken
and
once
again
we
didnt
have
to
deal
with
monsters
of
the
deep
it
was
a
man
a
living
man
a
black
indian
fisherman
a
poor
devil
who
no
doubt
had
come
to
gather
what
he
could
before
harvest
time
i
saw
the
bottom
of
his
dinghy
moored
a
few
feet
above
his
head
he
would
dive
and
go
back
up
in
quick
succession
a
stone
cut
in
the
shape
of
a
sugar
loaf
which
he
gripped
between
his
feet
while
a
rope
connected
it
to
his
boat
served
to
lower
him
more
quickly
to
the
ocean
floor
this
was
the
extent
of
his
equipment
arriving
on
the
seafloor
at
a
depth
of
about
five
meters
he
fell
to
his
knees
and
stuffed
his
sack
with
shellfish
gathered
at
random
then
he
went
back
up
emptied
his
sack
pulled
up
his
stone
and
started
all
over
again
the
whole
process
lasting
only
thirty
seconds
this
diver
didnt
see
us
a
shadow
cast
by
our
crag
hid
us
from
his
view
and
besides
how
could
this
poor
indian
ever
have
guessed
that
human
beings
creatures
like
himself
were
near
him
under
the
waters
eavesdropping
on
his
movements
not
missing
a
single
detail
of
his
fishing
so
he
went
up
and
down
several
times
he
gathered
only
about
ten
shellfish
per
dive
because
he
had
to
tear
them
from
the
banks
where
each
clung
with
its
tough
mass
of
filaments
and
how
many
of
these
oysters
for
which
he
risked
his
life
would
have
no
pearl
in
them
i
observed
him
with
great
care
his
movements
were
systematically
executed
and
for
half
an
hour
no
danger
seemed
to
threaten
him
so
i
had
gotten
used
to
the
sight
of
this
fascinating
fishing
when
all
at
once
just
as
the
indian
was
kneeling
on
the
seafloor
i
saw
him
make
a
frightened
gesture
stand
and
gather
himself
to
spring
back
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
i
understood
his
fear
a
gigantic
shadow
appeared
above
the
poor
diver
it
was
a
shark
of
huge
size
moving
in
diagonally
eyes
ablaze
jaws
wide
open
i
was
speechless
with
horror
unable
to
make
a
single
movement
with
one
vigorous
stroke
of
its
fins
the
voracious
animal
shot
toward
the
indian
who
jumped
aside
and
avoided
the
sharks
bite
but
not
the
thrashing
of
its
tail
because
that
tail
struck
him
across
the
chest
and
stretched
him
out
on
the
seafloor
this
scene
lasted
barely
a
few
seconds
the
shark
returned
rolled
over
on
its
back
and
was
getting
ready
to
cut
the
indian
in
half
when
captain
nemo
who
was
stationed
beside
me
suddenly
stood
up
then
he
strode
right
toward
the
monster
dagger
in
hand
ready
to
fight
it
at
close
quarters
just
as
it
was
about
to
snap
up
the
poor
fisherman
the
maneater
saw
its
new
adversary
repositioned
itself
on
its
belly
and
headed
swiftly
toward
him
i
can
see
captain
nemos
bearing
to
this
day
bracing
himself
he
waited
for
the
fearsome
maneater
with
wonderful
composure
and
when
the
latter
rushed
at
him
the
captain
leaped
aside
with
prodigious
quickness
avoided
a
collision
and
sank
his
dagger
into
its
belly
but
that
wasnt
the
end
of
the
story
a
dreadful
battle
was
joined
the
shark
bellowed
so
to
speak
blood
was
pouring
into
the
waves
from
its
wounds
the
sea
was
dyed
red
and
through
this
opaque
liquid
i
could
see
nothing
else
nothing
else
until
the
moment
when
through
a
rift
in
the
clouds
i
saw
the
daring
captain
clinging
to
one
of
the
animals
fins
fighting
the
monster
at
close
quarters
belaboring
his
enemys
belly
with
stabs
of
the
dagger
yet
unable
to
deliver
the
deciding
thrust
in
other
words
a
direct
hit
to
the
heart
in
its
struggles
the
maneater
churned
the
watery
mass
so
furiously
its
eddies
threatened
to
knock
me
over
i
wanted
to
run
to
the
captains
rescue
but
i
was
transfixed
with
horror
unable
to
move
i
stared
wildeyed
i
saw
the
fight
enter
a
new
phase
the
captain
fell
to
the
seafloor
toppled
by
the
enormous
mass
weighing
him
down
then
the
sharks
jaws
opened
astoundingly
wide
like
a
pair
of
industrial
shears
and
that
would
have
been
the
finish
of
captain
nemo
had
not
ned
land
quick
as
thought
rushed
forward
with
his
harpoon
and
driven
its
dreadful
point
into
the
sharks
underside
the
waves
were
saturated
with
masses
of
blood
the
waters
shook
with
the
movements
of
the
maneater
which
thrashed
about
with
indescribable
fury
ned
land
hadnt
missed
his
target
this
was
the
monsters
death
rattle
pierced
to
the
heart
it
was
struggling
with
dreadful
spasms
whose
aftershocks
knocked
conseil
off
his
feet
meanwhile
ned
land
pulled
the
captain
clear
uninjured
the
latter
stood
up
went
right
to
the
indian
quickly
cut
the
rope
binding
the
man
to
his
stone
took
the
fellow
in
his
arms
and
with
a
vigorous
kick
of
the
heel
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
three
of
us
followed
him
and
a
few
moments
later
miraculously
safe
we
reached
the
fishermans
longboat
captain
nemos
first
concern
was
to
revive
this
unfortunate
man
i
wasnt
sure
he
would
succeed
i
hoped
so
since
the
poor
devil
hadnt
been
under
very
long
but
that
stroke
from
the
sharks
tail
could
have
been
his
deathblow
fortunately
after
vigorous
massaging
by
conseil
and
the
captain
i
saw
the
nearly
drowned
man
regain
consciousness
little
by
little
he
opened
his
eyes
how
startled
he
must
have
felt
how
frightened
even
at
seeing
four
huge
copper
craniums
leaning
over
him
and
above
all
what
must
he
have
thought
when
captain
nemo
pulled
a
bag
of
pearls
from
a
pocket
in
his
diving
suit
and
placed
it
in
the
fishermans
hands
this
magnificent
benefaction
from
the
man
of
the
waters
to
the
poor
indian
from
ceylon
was
accepted
by
the
latter
with
trembling
hands
his
bewildered
eyes
indicated
that
he
didnt
know
to
what
superhuman
creatures
he
owed
both
his
life
and
his
fortune
at
the
captains
signal
we
returned
to
the
bank
of
shellfish
and
retracing
our
steps
we
walked
for
half
an
hour
until
we
encountered
the
anchor
connecting
the
seafloor
with
the
nautiluss
skiff
back
on
board
the
sailors
helped
divest
us
of
our
heavy
copper
carapaces
captain
nemos
first
words
were
spoken
to
the
canadian
thank
you
mr
land
he
told
him
tit
for
tat
captain
ned
land
replied
i
owed
it
to
you
the
ghost
of
a
smile
glided
across
the
captains
lips
and
that
was
all
to
the
nautilus
he
said
the
longboat
flew
over
the
waves
a
few
minutes
later
we
encountered
the
sharks
corpse
again
floating
from
the
black
markings
on
the
tips
of
its
fins
i
recognized
the
dreadful
squalus
melanopterus
from
the
seas
of
the
east
indies
a
variety
in
the
species
of
sharks
proper
it
was
more
than
twentyfive
feet
long
its
enormous
mouth
occupied
a
third
of
its
body
it
was
an
adult
as
could
be
seen
from
the
six
rows
of
teeth
forming
an
isosceles
triangle
in
its
upper
jaw
conseil
looked
at
it
with
purely
scientific
fascination
and
im
sure
he
placed
it
not
without
good
reason
in
the
class
of
cartilaginous
fish
order
chondropterygia
with
fixed
gills
family
selacia
genus
squalus
while
i
was
contemplating
this
inert
mass
suddenly
a
dozen
of
these
voracious
melanoptera
appeared
around
our
longboat
but
paying
no
attention
to
us
they
pounced
on
the
corpse
and
quarreled
over
every
scrap
of
it
by
830
we
were
back
on
board
the
nautilus
there
i
fell
to
thinking
about
the
incidents
that
marked
our
excursion
over
the
mannar
oysterbank
two
impressions
inevitably
stood
out
one
concerned
captain
nemos
matchless
bravery
the
other
his
devotion
to
a
human
being
a
representative
of
that
race
from
which
he
had
fled
beneath
the
seas
in
spite
of
everything
this
strange
man
hadnt
yet
succeeded
in
completely
stifling
his
heart
when
i
shared
these
impressions
with
him
he
answered
me
in
a
tone
touched
with
emotion
that
indian
professor
lives
in
the
land
of
the
oppressed
and
i
am
to
this
day
and
will
be
until
my
last
breath
a
native
of
that
same
land
chapter
4
the
red
sea
during
the
day
of
january
29
the
island
of
ceylon
disappeared
below
the
horizon
and
at
a
speed
of
twenty
miles
per
hour
the
nautilus
glided
into
the
labyrinthine
channels
that
separate
the
maldive
and
laccadive
islands
it
likewise
hugged
kiltan
island
a
shore
of
madreporic
origin
discovered
by
vasco
da
gama
in
1499
and
one
of
nineteen
chief
islands
in
the
island
group
of
the
laccadives
located
between
latitude
10
degrees
and
14
degrees
30
north
and
between
longitude
50
degrees
72
and
69
degrees
east
by
then
we
had
fared
16220
miles
or
7500
leagues
from
our
starting
point
in
the
seas
of
japan
the
next
day
january
30
when
the
nautilus
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
there
was
no
more
land
in
sight
setting
its
course
to
the
northnorthwest
the
ship
headed
toward
the
gulf
of
oman
carved
out
between
arabia
and
the
indian
peninsula
and
providing
access
to
the
persian
gulf
this
was
obviously
a
blind
alley
with
no
possible
outlet
so
where
was
captain
nemo
taking
us
i
was
unable
to
say
which
didnt
satisfy
the
canadian
who
that
day
asked
me
where
we
were
going
were
going
mr
ned
where
the
captains
fancy
takes
us
his
fancy
the
canadian
replied
wont
take
us
very
far
the
persian
gulf
has
no
outlet
and
if
we
enter
those
waters
it
wont
be
long
before
we
return
in
our
tracks
all
right
well
return
mr
land
and
after
the
persian
gulf
if
the
nautilus
wants
to
visit
the
red
sea
the
strait
of
bab
el
mandeb
is
still
there
to
let
us
in
i
dont
have
to
tell
you
sir
ned
land
replied
that
the
red
sea
is
just
as
landlocked
as
the
gulf
since
the
isthmus
of
suez
hasnt
been
cut
all
the
way
through
yet
and
even
if
it
was
a
boat
as
secretive
as
ours
wouldnt
risk
a
canal
intersected
with
locks
so
the
red
sea
wont
be
our
way
back
to
europe
either
but
i
didnt
say
wed
return
to
europe
what
do
you
figure
then
i
figure
that
after
visiting
these
unusual
waterways
of
arabia
and
egypt
the
nautilus
will
go
back
down
to
the
indian
ocean
perhaps
through
mozambique
channel
perhaps
off
the
mascarene
islands
and
then
make
for
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
once
were
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
canadian
asked
with
typical
persistence
well
then
well
enter
that
atlantic
ocean
with
which
we
arent
yet
familiar
whats
wrong
ned
my
friend
are
you
tired
of
this
voyage
under
the
seas
are
you
bored
with
the
constantly
changing
sight
of
these
underwater
wonders
speaking
for
myself
ill
be
extremely
distressed
to
see
the
end
of
a
voyage
so
few
men
will
ever
have
a
chance
to
make
but
dont
you
realize
professor
aronnax
the
canadian
replied
that
soon
well
have
been
imprisoned
for
three
whole
months
aboard
this
nautilus
no
ned
i
didnt
realize
it
i
dont
want
to
realize
it
and
i
dont
keep
track
of
every
day
and
every
hour
but
when
will
it
be
over
in
its
appointed
time
meanwhile
theres
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
and
our
discussions
are
futile
my
gallant
ned
if
you
come
and
tell
me
a
chance
to
escape
is
available
to
us
then
ill
discuss
it
with
you
but
that
isnt
the
case
and
in
all
honesty
i
dont
think
captain
nemo
ever
ventures
into
european
seas
this
short
dialogue
reveals
that
in
my
mania
for
the
nautilus
i
was
turning
into
the
spitting
image
of
its
commander
as
for
ned
land
he
ended
our
talk
in
his
best
speechifying
style
thats
all
fine
and
dandy
but
in
my
humble
opinion
a
life
in
jail
is
a
life
without
joy
for
four
days
until
february
3
the
nautilus
inspected
the
gulf
of
oman
at
various
speeds
and
depths
it
seemed
to
be
traveling
at
random
as
if
hesitating
over
which
course
to
follow
but
it
never
crossed
the
tropic
of
cancer
after
leaving
this
gulf
we
raised
muscat
for
an
instant
the
most
important
town
in
the
country
of
oman
i
marveled
at
its
strange
appearance
in
the
midst
of
the
black
rocks
surrounding
it
against
which
the
white
of
its
houses
and
forts
stood
out
sharply
i
spotted
the
rounded
domes
of
its
mosques
the
elegant
tips
of
its
minarets
and
its
fresh
leafy
terraces
but
it
was
only
a
fleeting
vision
and
the
nautilus
soon
sank
beneath
the
dark
waves
of
these
waterways
then
our
ship
went
along
at
a
distance
of
six
miles
from
the
arabic
coasts
of
mahra
and
hadhramaut
their
undulating
lines
of
mountains
relieved
by
a
few
ancient
ruins
on
february
5
we
finally
put
into
the
gulf
of
aden
a
genuine
funnel
stuck
into
the
neck
of
bab
el
mandeb
and
bottling
these
indian
waters
in
the
red
sea
on
february
6
the
nautilus
cruised
in
sight
of
the
city
of
aden
perched
on
a
promontory
connected
to
the
continent
by
a
narrow
isthmus
a
sort
of
inaccessible
gibraltar
whose
fortifications
the
english
rebuilt
after
capturing
it
in
1839
i
glimpsed
the
octagonal
minarets
of
this
town
which
used
to
be
one
of
the
wealthiest
busiest
commercial
centers
along
this
coast
as
the
arab
historian
idrisi
tells
it
i
was
convinced
that
when
captain
nemo
reached
this
point
he
would
back
out
again
but
i
was
mistaken
and
much
to
my
surprise
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
the
next
day
february
7
we
entered
the
strait
of
bab
el
mandeb
whose
name
means
gate
of
tears
in
the
arabic
language
twenty
miles
wide
its
only
fiftytwo
kilometers
long
and
with
the
nautilus
launched
at
full
speed
clearing
it
was
the
work
of
barely
an
hour
but
i
didnt
see
a
thing
not
even
perim
island
where
the
british
government
built
fortifications
to
strengthen
adens
position
there
were
many
english
and
french
steamers
plowing
this
narrow
passageway
liners
going
from
suez
to
bombay
calcutta
melbourne
runion
island
and
mauritius
far
too
much
traffic
for
the
nautilus
to
make
an
appearance
on
the
surface
so
it
wisely
stayed
in
midwater
finally
at
noon
we
were
plowing
the
waves
of
the
red
sea
the
red
sea
that
great
lake
so
famous
in
biblical
traditions
seldom
replenished
by
rains
fed
by
no
important
rivers
continually
drained
by
a
high
rate
of
evaporation
its
water
level
dropping
a
meter
and
a
half
every
year
if
it
were
fully
landlocked
like
a
lake
this
odd
gulf
might
dry
up
completely
on
this
score
its
inferior
to
its
neighbors
the
caspian
sea
and
the
dead
sea
whose
levels
lower
only
to
the
point
where
their
evaporation
exactly
equals
the
amounts
of
water
they
take
to
their
hearts
this
red
sea
is
2600
kilometers
long
with
an
average
width
of
240
in
the
days
of
the
ptolemies
and
the
roman
emperors
it
was
a
great
commercial
artery
for
the
world
and
when
its
isthmus
has
been
cut
through
it
will
completely
regain
that
bygone
importance
that
the
suez
railways
have
already
brought
back
in
part
i
would
not
even
attempt
to
understand
the
whim
that
induced
captain
nemo
to
take
us
into
this
gulf
but
i
wholeheartedly
approved
of
the
nautiluss
entering
it
it
adopted
a
medium
pace
sometimes
staying
on
the
surface
sometimes
diving
to
avoid
some
ship
and
so
i
could
observe
both
the
inside
and
topside
of
this
highly
unusual
sea
on
february
8
as
early
as
the
first
hours
of
daylight
mocha
appeared
before
us
a
town
now
in
ruins
whose
walls
would
collapse
at
the
mere
sound
of
a
cannon
and
which
shelters
a
few
leafy
date
trees
here
and
there
this
onceimportant
city
used
to
contain
six
public
marketplaces
plus
twentysix
mosques
and
its
walls
protected
by
fourteen
forts
fashioned
a
threekilometer
girdle
around
it
then
the
nautilus
drew
near
the
beaches
of
africa
where
the
sea
is
considerably
deeper
there
through
the
open
panels
and
in
a
midwater
of
crystal
clarity
our
ship
enabled
us
to
study
wonderful
bushes
of
shining
coral
and
huge
chunks
of
rock
wrapped
in
splendid
green
furs
of
algae
and
fucus
what
an
indescribable
sight
and
what
a
variety
of
settings
and
scenery
where
these
reefs
and
volcanic
islands
leveled
off
by
the
libyan
coast
but
soon
the
nautilus
hugged
the
eastern
shore
where
these
tree
forms
appeared
in
all
their
glory
this
was
off
the
coast
of
tihama
and
there
such
zoophyte
displays
not
only
flourished
below
sea
level
but
they
also
fashioned
picturesque
networks
that
unreeled
as
high
as
ten
fathoms
above
it
the
latter
were
more
whimsical
but
less
colorful
than
the
former
which
kept
their
bloom
thanks
to
the
moist
vitality
of
the
waters
how
many
delightful
hours
i
spent
in
this
way
at
the
lounge
window
how
many
new
specimens
of
underwater
flora
and
fauna
i
marveled
at
beneath
the
light
of
our
electric
beacon
mushroomshaped
fungus
coral
some
slatecolored
sea
anemone
including
the
species
thalassianthus
aster
among
others
organpipe
coral
arranged
like
flutes
and
just
begging
for
a
puff
from
the
god
pan
shells
unique
to
this
sea
that
dwell
in
madreporic
cavities
and
whose
bases
are
twisted
into
squat
spirals
and
finally
a
thousand
samples
of
a
polypary
i
hadnt
observed
until
then
the
common
sponge
first
division
in
the
polyp
group
the
class
spongiaria
has
been
created
by
scientists
precisely
for
this
unusual
exhibit
whose
usefulness
is
beyond
dispute
the
sponge
is
definitely
not
a
plant
as
some
naturalists
still
believe
but
an
animal
of
the
lowest
order
a
polypary
inferior
even
to
coral
its
animal
nature
isnt
in
doubt
and
we
cant
accept
even
the
views
of
the
ancients
who
regarded
it
as
halfway
between
plant
and
animal
but
i
must
say
that
naturalists
are
not
in
agreement
on
the
structural
mode
of
sponges
for
some
its
a
polypary
and
for
others
such
as
professor
milneedwards
its
a
single
solitary
individual
the
class
spongiaria
contains
about
300
species
that
are
encountered
in
a
large
number
of
seas
and
even
in
certain
streams
where
theyve
been
given
the
name
freshwater
sponges
but
their
waters
of
choice
are
the
red
sea
and
the
mediterranean
near
the
greek
islands
or
the
coast
of
syria
these
waters
witness
the
reproduction
and
growth
of
soft
delicate
bath
sponges
whose
prices
run
as
high
as
150
francs
apiece
the
yellow
sponge
from
syria
the
horn
sponge
from
barbary
etc
but
since
i
had
no
hope
of
studying
these
zoophytes
in
the
seaports
of
the
levant
from
which
we
were
separated
by
the
insuperable
isthmus
of
suez
i
had
to
be
content
with
observing
them
in
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
so
i
called
conseil
to
my
side
while
at
an
average
depth
of
eight
to
nine
meters
the
nautilus
slowly
skimmed
every
beautiful
rock
on
the
easterly
coast
there
sponges
grew
in
every
shape
globular
stalklike
leaflike
fingerlike
with
reasonable
accuracy
they
lived
up
to
their
nicknames
of
basket
sponges
chalice
sponges
distaff
sponges
elkhorn
sponges
lions
paws
peacocks
tails
and
neptunes
glovesdesignations
bestowed
on
them
by
fishermen
more
poetically
inclined
than
scientists
a
gelatinous
semifluid
substance
coated
the
fibrous
tissue
of
these
sponges
and
from
this
tissue
there
escaped
a
steady
trickle
of
water
that
after
carrying
sustenance
to
each
cell
was
being
expelled
by
a
contracting
movement
this
jellylike
substance
disappears
when
the
polyp
dies
emitting
ammonia
as
it
rots
finally
nothing
remains
but
the
fibers
either
gelatinous
or
made
of
horn
that
constitute
your
household
sponge
which
takes
on
a
russet
hue
and
is
used
for
various
tasks
depending
on
its
degree
of
elasticity
permeability
or
resistance
to
saturation
these
polyparies
were
sticking
to
rocks
shells
of
mollusks
and
even
the
stalks
of
water
plants
they
adorned
the
smallest
crevices
some
sprawling
others
standing
or
hanging
like
coral
outgrowths
i
told
conseil
that
sponges
are
fished
up
in
two
ways
either
by
dragnet
or
by
hand
the
latter
method
calls
for
the
services
of
a
diver
but
its
preferable
because
it
spares
the
polyparys
tissue
leaving
it
with
a
much
higher
market
value
other
zoophytes
swarming
near
the
sponges
consisted
chiefly
of
a
very
elegant
species
of
jellyfish
mollusks
were
represented
by
varieties
of
squid
that
according
to
professor
orbigny
are
unique
to
the
red
sea
and
reptiles
by
virgata
turtles
belonging
to
the
genus
chelonia
which
furnished
our
table
with
a
dainty
but
wholesome
dish
as
for
fish
they
were
numerous
and
often
remarkable
here
are
the
ones
that
the
nautiluss
nets
most
frequently
hauled
on
board
rays
including
spotted
rays
that
were
oval
in
shape
and
brick
red
in
color
their
bodies
strewn
with
erratic
blue
speckles
and
identifiable
by
their
jagged
double
stings
silverbacked
skates
common
stingrays
with
stippled
tails
butterfly
rays
that
looked
like
huge
twometer

that
were
a
type
of
cartilaginous
fish
closer
to
the
shark
trunkfish
known
as
dromedaries
that
were

we
had
already
crossed
on
february
9
the
nautilus
cruised
in
the
widest
part
of
the
red
sea
measuring
190
miles
straight
across
from
suakin
on
the
west
coast
to
qunfidha
on
the
east
coast
at
noon
that
day
after
our
position
fix
captain
nemo
climbed
onto
the
platform
where
i
happened
to
be
i
vowed
not
to
let
him
go
below
again
without
at
least
sounding
him
out
on
his
future
plans
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
came
over
graciously
offered
me
a
cigar
and
said
to
me
well
professor
are
you
pleased
with
this
red
sea
have
you
seen
enough
of
its
hidden
wonders
its
fish
and
zoophytes
its
gardens
of
sponges
and
forests
of
coral
have
you
glimpsed
the
towns
built
on
its
shores
yes
captain
nemo
i
replied
and
the
nautilus
is
wonderfully
suited
to
this
whole
survey
ah
its
a
clever
boat
yes
sir
clever
daring
and
invulnerable
it
fears
neither
the
red
seas
dreadful
storms
nor
its
currents
and
reefs
indeed
i
said
this
sea
is
mentioned
as
one
of
the
worst
and
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
if
im
not
mistaken
it
had
an
abominable
reputation
thoroughly
abominable
professor
aronnax
the
greek
and
latin
historians
can
find
nothing
to
say
in
its
favor
and
the
greek
geographer
strabo
adds
that
its
especially
rough
during
the
rainy
season
and
the
period
of
summer
prevailing
winds
the
arab
idrisi
referring
to
it
by
the
name
gulf
of
colzoum
relates
that
ships
perished
in
large
numbers
on
its
sandbanks
and
that
no
one
risked
navigating
it
by
night
this
he
claims
is
a
sea
subject
to
fearful
hurricanes
strewn
with
inhospitable
islands
and
with
nothing
good
to
offer
either
on
its
surface
or
in
its
depths
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
same
views
can
also
be
found
in
arrian
agatharchides
and
artemidorus
one
can
easily
see
i
answered
that
those
historians
didnt
navigate
aboard
the
nautilus
indeed
the
captain
replied
with
a
smile
and
in
this
respect
the
moderns
arent
much
farther
along
than
the
ancients
it
took
many
centuries
to
discover
the
mechanical
power
of
steam
who
knows
whether
well
see
a
second
nautilus
within
the
next
100
years
progress
is
slow
professor
aronnax
its
true
i
replied
your
ship
is
a
century
ahead
of
its
time
perhaps
several
centuries
it
would
be
most
unfortunate
if
such
a
secret
were
to
die
with
its
inventor
captain
nemo
did
not
reply
after
some
minutes
of
silence
we
were
discussing
he
said
the
views
of
ancient
historians
on
the
dangers
of
navigating
this
red
sea
true
i
replied
but
werent
their
fears
exaggerated
yes
and
no
professor
aronnax
answered
captain
nemo
who
seemed
to
know
his
red
sea
by
heart
to
a
modern
ship
well
rigged
solidly
constructed
and
in
control
of
its
course
thanks
to
obedient
steam
some
conditions
are
no
longer
hazardous
that
offered
all
sorts
of
dangers
to
the
vessels
of
the
ancients
picture
those
early
navigators
venturing
forth
in
sailboats
built
from
planks
lashed
together
with
palmtree
ropes
caulked
with
powdered
resin
and
coated
with
dogfish
grease
they
didnt
even
have
instruments
for
taking
their
bearings
they
went
by
guesswork
in
the
midst
of
currents
they
barely
knew
under
such
conditions
shipwrecks
had
to
be
numerous
but
nowadays
steamers
providing
service
between
suez
and
the
south
seas
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
fury
of
this
gulf
despite
the
contrary
winds
of
its
monsoons
their
captains
and
passengers
no
longer
prepare
for
departure
with
sacrifices
to
placate
the
gods
and
after
returning
they
dont
traipse
in
wreaths
and
gold
ribbons
to
say
thanks
at
the
local
temple
agreed
i
said
and
steam
seems
to
have
killed
off
all
gratitude
in
seamens
hearts
but
since
you
seem
to
have
made
a
special
study
of
this
sea
captain
can
you
tell
me
how
it
got
its
name
many
explanations
exist
on
the
subject
professor
aronnax
would
you
like
to
hear
the
views
of
one
chronicler
in
the
14th
century
gladly
this
fanciful
fellow
claims
the
sea
was
given
its
name
after
the
crossing
of
the
israelites
when
the
pharaoh
perished
in
those
waves
that
came
together
again
at
moses
command
to
mark
that
miraculous
sequel
the
sea
turned
a
red
without
equal
thus
no
other
course
would
do
but
to
name
it
for
its
hue
an
artistic
explanation
captain
nemo
i
replied
but
im
unable
to
rest
content
with
it
so
ill
ask
you
for
your
own
personal
views
here
they
come
to
my
thinking
professor
aronnax
this
red
sea
designation
must
be
regarded
as
a
translation
of
the
hebrew
word
edrom
and
if
the
ancients
gave
it
that
name
it
was
because
of
the
unique
color
of
its
waters
until
now
however
ive
seen
only
clear
waves
without
any
unique
hue
surely
but
as
we
move
ahead
to
the
far
end
of
this
gulf
youll
note
its
odd
appearance
i
recall
seeing
the
bay
of
el
tur
completely
red
like
a
lake
of
blood
and
you
attribute
this
color
to
the
presence
of
microscopic
algae
yes
its
a
purplish
mucilaginous
substance
produced
by
those
tiny
buds
known
by
the
name
trichodesmia
40000
of
which
are
needed
to
occupy
the
space
of
one
square
millimeter
perhaps
youll
encounter
them
when
we
reach
el
tur
hence
captain
nemo
this
isnt
the
first
time
youve
gone
through
the
red
sea
aboard
the
nautilus
no
sir
then
since
youve
already
mentioned
the
crossing
of
the
israelites
and
the
catastrophe
that
befell
the
egyptians
i
would
ask
if
youve
ever
discovered
any
traces
under
the
waters
of
that
great
historic
event
no
professor
and
for
an
excellent
reason
whats
that
its
because
that
same
locality
where
moses
crossed
with
all
his
people
is
now
so
clogged
with
sand
camels
can
barely
get
their
legs
wet
you
can
understand
that
my
nautilus
wouldnt
have
enough
water
for
itself
and
that
locality
is




i
asked
that
locality
lies
a
little
above
suez
in
a
sound
that
used
to
form
a
deep
estuary
when
the
red
sea
stretched
as
far
as
the
bitter
lakes
now
whether
or
not
their
crossing
was
literally
miraculous
the
israelites
did
cross
there
in
returning
to
the
promised
land
and
the
pharaohs
army
did
perish
at
precisely
that
locality
so
i
think
that
excavating
those
sands
would
bring
to
light
a
great
many
weapons
and
tools
of
egyptian
origin
obviously
i
replied
and
for
the
sake
of
archaeology
lets
hope
that
sooner
or
later
such
excavations
do
take
place
once
new
towns
are
settled
on
the
isthmus
after
the
suez
canal
has
been
cut
througha
canal
by
the
way
of
little
use
to
a
ship
such
as
the
nautilus
surely
but
of
great
use
to
the
world
at
large
captain
nemo
said
the
ancients
well
understood
the
usefulness
to
commerce
of
connecting
the
red
sea
with
the
mediterranean
but
they
never
dreamed
of
cutting
a
canal
between
the
two
and
instead
they
picked
the
nile
as
their
link
if
we
can
trust
tradition
it
was
probably
egypts
king
sesostris
who
started
digging
the
canal
needed
to
join
the
nile
with
the
red
sea
whats
certain
is
that
in
615
bc
king
necho
ii
was
hard
at
work
on
a
canal
that
was
fed
by
nile
water
and
ran
through
the
egyptian
plains
opposite
arabia
this
canal
could
be
traveled
in
four
days
and
it
was
so
wide
two
tripletiered
galleys
could
pass
through
it
abreast
its
construction
was
continued
by
darius
the
great
son
of
hystaspes
and
probably
completed
by
king
ptolemy
ii
strabo
saw
it
used
for
shipping
but
the
weakness
of
its
slope
between
its
starting
point
near
bubastis
and
the
red
sea
left
it
navigable
only
a
few
months
out
of
the
year
this
canal
served
commerce
until
the
century
of
romes
antonine
emperors
it
was
then
abandoned
and
covered
with
sand
subsequently
reinstated
by
arabias
caliph
omar
i
and
finally
filled
in
for
good
in
761
or
762
ad
by
caliph
almansur
in
an
effort
to
prevent
supplies
from
reaching
mohammed
ibn
abdullah
who
had
rebelled
against
him
during
his
egyptian
campaign
your
general
napoleon
bonaparte
discovered
traces
of
this
old
canal
in
the
suez
desert
and
when
the
tide
caught
him
by
surprise
he
wellnigh
perished
just
a
few
hours
before
rejoining
his
regiment
at
hadjaroth
the
very
place
where
moses
had
pitched
camp
3300
years
before
him
well
captain
what
the
ancients
hesitated
to
undertake
mr
de
lesseps
is
now
finishing
up
his
joining
of
these
two
seas
will
shorten
the
route
from
cadiz
to
the
east
indies
by
9000
kilometers
and
hell
soon
change
africa
into
an
immense
island
yes
professor
aronnax
and
you
have
every
right
to
be
proud
of
your
fellow
countryman
such
a
man
brings
a
nation
more
honor
than
the
greatest
commanders
like
so
many
others
he
began
with
difficulties
and
setbacks
but
he
triumphed
because
he
has
the
volunteer
spirit
and
its
sad
to
think
that
this
deed
which
should
have
been
an
international
deed
which
would
have
insured
that
any
administration
went
down
in
history
will
succeed
only
through
the
efforts
of
one
man
so
all
hail
to
mr
de
lesseps
yes
all
hail
to
that
great
french
citizen
i
replied
quite
startled
by
how
emphatically
captain
nemo
had
just
spoken
unfortunately
he
went
on
i
cant
take
you
through
that
suez
canal
but
the
day
after
tomorrow
youll
be
able
to
see
the
long
jetties
of
port
said
when
were
in
the
mediterranean
in
the
mediterranean
i
exclaimed
yes
professor
does
that
amaze
you
what
amazes
me
is
thinking
well
be
there
the
day
after
tomorrow
oh
really
yes
captain
although
since
ive
been
aboard
your
vessel
i
should
have
formed
the
habit
of
not
being
amazed
by
anything
but
what
is
it
that
startles
you
the
thought
of
how
hideously
fast
the
nautilus
will
need
to
go
if
its
to
double
the
cape
of
good
hope
circle
around
africa
and
lie
in
the
open
mediterranean
by
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
who
says
it
will
circle
africa
professor
whats
this
talk
about
doubling
the
cape
of
good
hope
but
unless
the
nautilus
navigates
on
dry
land
and
crosses
over
the
isthmus
or
under
it
professor
aronnax
under
it
surely
captain
nemo
replied
serenely
under
that
tongue
of
land
nature
long
ago
made
what
man
today
is
making
on
its
surface
what
theres
a
passageway
yes
an
underground
passageway
that
ive
named
the
arabian
tunnel
it
starts
below
suez
and
leads
to
the
bay
of
pelusium
but
isnt
that
isthmus
only
composed
of
quicksand
to
a
certain
depth
but
at
merely
fifty
meters
one
encounters
a
firm
foundation
of
rock
and
its
by
luck
that
you
discovered
this
passageway
i
asked
more
and
more
startled
luck
plus
logic
professor
and
logic
even
more
than
luck
captain
i
hear
you
but
i
cant
believe
my
ears
oh
sir
the
old
saying
still
holds
good
aures
habent
et
non
audient
not
only
does
this
passageway
exist
but
ive
taken
advantage
of
it
on
several
occasions
without
it
i
wouldnt
have
ventured
today
into
such
a
blind
alley
as
the
red
sea
latin
they
have
ears
but
hear
not
ed
is
it
indiscreet
to
ask
how
you
discovered
this
tunnel
sir
the
captain
answered
me
there
can
be
no
secrets
between
men
who
will
never
leave
each
other
i
ignored
this
innuendo
and
waited
for
captain
nemos
explanation
professor
he
told
me
the
simple
logic
of
the
naturalist
led
me
to
discover
this
passageway
and
i
alone
am
familiar
with
it
id
noted
that
in
the
red
sea
and
the
mediterranean
there
exist
a
number
of
absolutely
identical
species
of
fish
eels
butterfish
greenfish
bass
jewelfish
flying
fish
certain
of
this
fact
i
wondered
if
there
werent
a
connection
between
the
two
seas
if
there
were
its
underground
current
had
to
go
from
the
red
sea
to
the
mediterranean
simply
because
of
their
difference
in
level
so
i
caught
a
large
number
of
fish
in
the
vicinity
of
suez
i
slipped
copper
rings
around
their
tails
and
tossed
them
back
into
the
sea
a
few
months
later
off
the
coast
of
syria
i
recaptured
a
few
specimens
of
my
fish
adorned
with
their
telltale
rings
so
this
proved
to
me
that
some
connection
existed
between
the
two
seas
i
searched
for
it
with
my
nautilus
i
discovered
it
i
ventured
into
it
and
soon
professor
you
also
will
have
cleared
my
arabic
tunnel
chapter
5
arabian
tunnel
the
same
day
i
reported
to
conseil
and
ned
land
that
part
of
the
foregoing
conversation
directly
concerning
them
when
i
told
them
we
would
be
lying
in
mediterranean
waters
within
two
days
conseil
clapped
his
hands
but
the
canadian
shrugged
his
shoulders
an
underwater
tunnel
he
exclaimed
a
connection
between
two
seas
who
ever
heard
of
such
malarkey
ned
my
friend
conseil
replied
had
you
ever
heard
of
the
nautilus
no
yet
here
it
is
so
dont
shrug
your
shoulders
so
blithely
and
dont
discount
something
with
the
feeble
excuse
that
youve
never
heard
of
it
well
soon
see
ned
land
shot
back
shaking
his
head
after
all
id
like
nothing
better
than
to
believe
in
your
captains
little
passageway
and
may
heaven
grant
it
really
does
take
us
to
the
mediterranean
the
same
evening
at
latitude
21
degrees
30
north
the
nautilus
was
afloat
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
drawing
nearer
to
the
arab
coast
i
spotted
jidda
an
important
financial
center
for
egypt
syria
turkey
and
the
east
indies
i
could
distinguish
with
reasonable
clarity
the
overall
effect
of
its
buildings
the
ships
made
fast
along
its
wharves
and
those
bigger
vessels
whose
draft
of
water
required
them
to
drop
anchor
at
the
ports
offshore
mooring
the
sun
fairly
low
on
the
horizon
struck
full
force
on
the
houses
in
this
town
accenting
their
whiteness
outside
the
city
limits
some
wood
or
reed
huts
indicated
the
quarter
where
the
bedouins
lived
soon
jidda
faded
into
the
shadows
of
evening
and
the
nautilus
went
back
beneath
the
mildly
phosphorescent
waters
the
next
day
february
10
several
ships
appeared
running
on
our
opposite
tack
the
nautilus
resumed
its
underwater
navigating
but
at
the
moment
of
our
noon
sights
the
sea
was
deserted
and
the
ship
rose
again
to
its
waterline
with
ned
and
conseil
i
went
to
sit
on
the
platform
the
coast
to
the
east
looked
like
a
slightly
blurred
mass
in
a
damp
fog
leaning
against
the
sides
of
the
skiff
we
were
chatting
of
one
thing
and
another
when
ned
land
stretched
his
hand
toward
a
point
in
the
water
saying
to
me
see
anything
out
there
professor
no
ned
i
replied
but
you
know
i
dont
have
your
eyes
take
a
good
look
ned
went
on
there
ahead
to
starboard
almost
level
with
the
beacon
dont
you
see
a
mass
that
seems
to
be
moving
around
right
i
said
after
observing
carefully
i
can
make
out
something
like
a
long
blackish
object
on
the
surface
of
the
water
a
second
nautilus
conseil
said
no
the
canadian
replied
unless
im
badly
mistaken
thats
some
marine
animal
are
there
whales
in
the
red
sea
conseil
asked
yes
my
boy
i
replied
theyre
sometimes
found
here
thats
no
whale
continued
ned
land
whose
eyes
never
strayed
from
the
object
they
had
sighted
were
old
chums
whales
and
i
and
i
couldnt
mistake
their
little
ways
lets
wait
and
see
conseil
said
the
nautilus
is
heading
that
direction
and
well
soon
know
what
were
in
for
in
fact
that
blackish
object
was
soon
only
a
mile
away
from
us
it
looked
like
a
huge
reef
stranded
in
midocean
what
was
it
i
still
couldnt
make
up
my
mind
oh
its
moving
off
its
diving
ned
land
exclaimed
damnation
what
can
that
animal
be
it
doesnt
have
a
forked
tail
like
baleen
whales
or
sperm
whales
and
its
fins
look
like
sawedoff
limbs
but
in
that
case
i
put
in
good
lord
the
canadian
went
on
its
rolled
over
on
its
back
and
its
raising
its
breasts
in
the
air
its
a
siren
conseil
exclaimed
with
all
due
respect
to
master
its
an
actual
mermaid
that
word
siren
put
me
back
on
track
and
i
realized
that
the
animal
belonged
to
the
order
sirenia
marine
creatures
that
legends
have
turned
into
mermaids
half
woman
half
fish
no
i
told
conseil
thats
no
mermaid
its
an
unusual
creature
of
which
only
a
few
specimens
are
left
in
the
red
sea
thats
a
dugong
order
sirenia
group
pisciforma
subclass
monodelphia
class
mammalia
branch
vertebrata
conseil
replied
and
when
conseil
has
spoken
theres
nothing
else
to
be
said
meanwhile
ned
land
kept
staring
his
eyes
were
gleaming
with
desire
at
the
sight
of
that
animal
his
hands
were
ready
to
hurl
a
harpoon
you
would
have
thought
he
was
waiting
for
the
right
moment
to
jump
overboard
and
attack
the
creature
in
its
own
element
oh
sir
he
told
me
in
a
voice
trembling
with
excitement
ive
never
killed
anything
like
that
his
whole
being
was
concentrated
in
this
last
word
just
then
captain
nemo
appeared
on
the
platform
he
spotted
the
dugong
he
understood
the
canadians
frame
of
mind
and
addressed
him
directly
if
you
held
a
harpoon
mr
land
wouldnt
your
hands
be
itching
to
put
it
to
work
positively
sir
and
just
for
one
day
would
it
displease
you
to
return
to
your
fishermans
trade
and
add
this
cetacean
to
the
list
of
those
youve
already
hunted
down
it
wouldnt
displease
me
one
bit
all
right
you
can
try
your
luck
thank
you
sir
ned
land
replied
his
eyes
ablaze
only
the
captain
went
on
i
urge
you
to
aim
carefully
at
this
animal
in
your
own
personal
interest
is
the
dugong
dangerous
to
attack
i
asked
despite
the
canadians
shrug
of
the
shoulders
yes
sometimes
the
captain
replied
these
animals
have
been
known
to
turn
on
their
assailants
and
capsize
their
longboats
but
with
mr
land
that
danger
isnt
to
be
feared
his
eye
is
sharp
his
arm
is
sure
if
i
recommend
that
he
aim
carefully
at
this
dugong
its
because
the
animal
is
justly
regarded
as
fine
game
and
i
know
mr
land
doesnt
despise
a
choice
morsel
aha
the
canadian
put
in
this
beast
offers
the
added
luxury
of
being
good
to
eat
yes
mr
land
its
flesh
is
actual
red
meat
highly
prized
and
set
aside
throughout
malaysia
for
the
tables
of
aristocrats
accordingly
this
excellent
animal
has
been
hunted
so
bloodthirstily
that
like
its
manatee
relatives
it
has
become
more
and
more
scarce
in
that
case
captain
conseil
said
in
all
seriousness
on
the
offchance
that
this
creature
might
be
the
last
of
its
line
wouldnt
it
be
advisable
to
spare
its
life
in
the
interests
of
science
maybe
the
canadian
answered
it
would
be
better
to
hunt
it
down
in
the
interests
of
mealtime
then
proceed
mr
land
captain
nemo
replied
just
then
as
mute
and
emotionless
as
ever
seven
crewmen
climbed
onto
the
platform
one
carried
a
harpoon
and
line
similar
to
those
used
in
whale
fishing
its
deck
paneling
opened
the
skiff
was
wrenched
from
its
socket
and
launched
to
sea
six
rowers
sat
on
the
thwarts
and
the
coxswain
took
the
tiller
ned
conseil
and
i
found
seats
in
the
stern
arent
you
coming
captain
i
asked
no
sir
but
i
wish
you
happy
hunting
the
skiff
pulled
clear
and
carried
off
by
its
six
oars
it
headed
swiftly
toward
the
dugong
which
by
then
was
floating
two
miles
from
the
nautilus
arriving
within
a
few
cable
lengths
of
the
cetacean
our
longboat
slowed
down
and
the
sculls
dipped
noiselessly
into
the
tranquil
waters
harpoon
in
hand
ned
land
went
to
take
his
stand
in
the
skiffs
bow
harpoons
used
for
hunting
whales
are
usually
attached
to
a
very
long
rope
that
pays
out
quickly
when
the
wounded
animal
drags
it
with
him
but
this
rope
measured
no
more
than
about
ten
fathoms
and
its
end
had
simply
been
fastened
to
a
small
barrel
that
while
floating
would
indicate
the
dugongs
movements
beneath
the
waters
i
stood
up
and
could
clearly
observe
the
canadians
adversary
this
dugongwhich
also
boasts
the
name
halicoreclosely
resembled
a
manatee
its
oblong
body
ended
in
a
very
long
caudal
fin
and
its
lateral
fins
in
actual
fingers
it
differs
from
the
manatee
in
that
its
upper
jaw
is
armed
with
two
long
pointed
teeth
that
form
diverging
tusks
on
either
side
this
dugong
that
ned
land
was
preparing
to
attack
was
of
colossal
dimensions
easily
exceeding
seven
meters
in
length
it
didnt
stir
and
seemed
to
be
sleeping
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
a
circumstance
that
should
have
made
it
easier
to
capture
the
skiff
approached
cautiously
to
within
three
fathoms
of
the
animal
the
oars
hung
suspended
above
their
rowlocks
i
was
crouching
his
body
leaning
slightly
back
ned
land
brandished
his
harpoon
with
expert
hands
suddenly
a
hissing
sound
was
audible
and
the
dugong
disappeared
although
the
harpoon
had
been
forcefully
hurled
it
apparently
had
hit
only
water
damnation
exclaimed
the
furious
canadian
i
missed
it
no
i
said
the
animals
wounded
theres
its
blood
but
your
weapon
didnt
stick
in
its
body
my
harpoon
get
my
harpoon
ned
land
exclaimed
the
sailors
went
back
to
their
sculling
and
the
coxswain
steered
the
longboat
toward
the
floating
barrel
we
fished
up
the
harpoon
and
the
skiff
started
off
in
pursuit
of
the
animal
the
latter
returned
from
time
to
time
to
breathe
at
the
surface
of
the
sea
its
wound
hadnt
weakened
it
because
it
went
with
tremendous
speed
driven
by
energetic
arms
the
longboat
flew
on
its
trail
several
times
we
got
within
a
few
fathoms
of
it
and
the
canadian
hovered
in
readiness
to
strike
but
then
the
dugong
would
steal
away
with
a
sudden
dive
and
it
proved
impossible
to
overtake
the
beast
ill
let
you
assess
the
degree
of
anger
consuming
our
impatient
ned
land
he
hurled
at
the
hapless
animal
the
most
potent
swearwords
in
the
english
language
for
my
part
i
was
simply
distressed
to
see
this
dugong
outwit
our
every
scheme
we
chased
it
unflaggingly
for
a
full
hour
and
id
begun
to
think
it
would
prove
too
difficult
to
capture
when
the
animal
got
the
untimely
idea
of
taking
revenge
on
us
a
notion
it
would
soon
have
cause
to
regret
it
wheeled
on
the
skiff
to
assault
us
in
its
turn
this
maneuver
did
not
escape
the
canadian
watch
out
he
said
the
coxswain
pronounced
a
few
words
in
his
bizarre
language
and
no
doubt
he
alerted
his
men
to
keep
on
their
guard
arriving
within
twenty
feet
of
the
skiff
the
dugong
stopped
sharply
sniffing
the
air
with
its
huge
nostrils
pierced
not
at
the
tip
of
its
muzzle
but
on
its
topside
then
it
gathered
itself
and
sprang
at
us
the
skiff
couldnt
avoid
the
collision
half
overturned
it
shipped
a
ton
or
two
of
water
that
we
had
to
bail
out
but
thanks
to
our
skillful
coxswain
we
were
fouled
on
the
bias
rather
than
broadside
so
we
didnt
capsize
clinging
to
the
stempost
ned
land
thrust
his
harpoon
again
and
again
into
the
gigantic
animal
which
imbedded
its
teeth
in
our
gunwale
and
lifted
the
longboat
out
of
the
water
as
a
lion
would
lift
a
deer
we
were
thrown
on
top
of
each
other
and
i
have
no
idea
how
the
venture
would
have
ended
had
not
the
canadian
still
thirsting
for
the
beasts
blood
finally
pierced
it
to
the
heart
i
heard
its
teeth
grind
on
sheet
iron
and
the
dugong
disappeared
taking
our
harpoon
along
with
it
but
the
barrel
soon
popped
up
on
the
surface
and
a
few
moments
later
the
animals
body
appeared
and
rolled
over
on
its
back
our
skiff
rejoined
it
took
it
in
tow
and
headed
to
the
nautilus
it
took
pulleys
of
great
strength
to
hoist
this
dugong
onto
the
platform
the
beast
weighed
5000
kilograms
it
was
carved
up
in
sight
of
the
canadian
who
remained
to
watch
every
detail
of
the
operation
at
dinner
the
same
day
my
steward
served
me
some
slices
of
this
flesh
skillfully
dressed
by
the
ships
cook
i
found
it
excellent
even
better
than
veal
if
not
beef
the
next
morning

the
nautiluss

was
enriched
by
more
dainty
game

are

speckled
with

by
then
the
nautilus
had
reduced
speed
it
moved
ahead
at
a
saunter
so
to
speak
i
observed
that
the
red
seas
water
was
becoming
less
salty
the
closer
we
got
to
suez
near
five
oclock
in
the
afternoon
we
sighted
cape
ras
mohammed
to
the
north
this
cape
forms
the
tip
of
arabia
petraea
which
lies
between
the
gulf
of
suez
and
the
gulf
of
aqaba
the
nautilus
entered
the
strait
of
jubal
which
leads
to
the
gulf
of
suez
i
could
clearly
make
out
a
high
mountain
crowning
ras
mohammed
between
the
two
gulfs
it
was

always
pictures
as
wreathed
in
lightning
at
six
oclock
sometimes
afloat
and
sometimes
submerged
the
nautilus
passed
well
out
from
el
tur
which
sat
at
the
far
end
of
a
bay
whose
waters
seemed
to
be
dyed
red
as
captain
nemo
had
already
mentioned
then
night
fell
in
the
midst
of
a
heavy
silence
occasionally
broken
by
the
calls
of
pelicans
and
nocturnal
birds
by
the
sound
of
surf
chafing
against
rocks
or
by
the
distant
moan
of
a
steamer
churning
the
waves
of
the
gulf
with
noisy
blades
from
eight
to
nine
oclock
the
nautilus
stayed
a
few
meters
beneath
the
waters
according
to
my
calculations
we
had
to
be
quite
close
to
suez
through
the
panels
in
the
lounge
i
spotted
rocky
bottoms
brightly
lit
by
our
electric
rays
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
strait
was
getting
narrower
and
narrower
at
915
when
our
boat
returned
to
the
surface
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
i
was
quite
impatient
to
clear
captain
nemos
tunnel
couldnt
sit
still
and
wanted
to
breathe
the
fresh
night
air
soon
in
the
shadows
i
spotted
a
pale
signal
light
glimmering
a
mile
away
half
discolored
by
mist
a
floating
lighthouse
said
someone
next
to
me
i
turned
and
discovered
the
captain
thats
the
floating
signal
light
of
suez
he
went
on
it
wont
be
long
before
we
reach
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
it
cant
be
very
easy
to
enter
it
no
sir
accordingly
im
in
the
habit
of
staying
in
the
pilothouse
and
directing
maneuvers
myself
and
now
if
youll
kindly
go
below
professor
aronnax
the
nautilus
is
about
to
sink
beneath
the
waves
and
it
will
only
return
to
the
surface
after
weve
cleared
the
arabian
tunnel
i
followed
captain
nemo
the
hatch
closed
the
ballast
tanks
filled
with
water
and
the
submersible
sank
some
ten
meters
down
just
as
i
was
about
to
repair
to
my
stateroom
the
captain
stopped
me
professor
he
said
to
me
would
you
like
to
go
with
me
to
the
wheelhouse
i
was
afraid
to
ask
i
replied
come
along
then
this
way
youll
learn
the
full
story
about
this
combination
underwater
and
underground
navigating
captain
nemo
led
me
to
the
central
companionway
in
midstair
he
opened
a
door
went
along
the
upper
gangways
and
arrived
at
the
wheelhouse
which
as
you
know
stands
at
one
end
of
the
platform
it
was
a
cabin
measuring
six
feet
square
and
closely
resembling
those
occupied
by
the
helmsmen
of
steamboats
on
the
mississippi
or
hudson
rivers
in
the
center
stood
an
upright
wheel
geared
to
rudder
cables
running
to
the
nautiluss
stern
set
in
the
cabins
walls
were
four
deadlights
windows
of
biconvex
glass
that
enabled
the
man
at
the
helm
to
see
in
every
direction
the
cabin
was
dark
but
my
eyes
soon
grew
accustomed
to
its
darkness
and
i
saw
the
pilot
a
muscular
man
whose
hands
rested
on
the
pegs
of
the
wheel
outside
the
sea
was
brightly
lit
by
the
beacon
shining
behind
the
cabin
at
the
other
end
of
the
platform
now
captain
nemo
said
lets
look
for
our
passageway
electric
wires
linked
the
pilothouse
with
the
engine
room
and
from
this
cabin
the
captain
could
simultaneously
signal
heading
and
speed
to
his
nautilus
he
pressed
a
metal
button
and
at
once
the
propeller
slowed
down
significantly
i
stared
in
silence
at
the
high
sheer
wall
we
were
skirting
just
then
the
firm
base
of
the
sandy
mountains
on
the
coast
for
an
hour
we
went
along
it
in
this
fashion
staying
only
a
few
meters
away
captain
nemo
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
two
concentric
circles
of
the
compass
hanging
in
the
cabin
at
a
mere
gesture
from
him
the
helmsman
would
instantly
change
the
nautiluss
heading
standing
by
the
port
deadlight
i
spotted
magnificent
coral
substructures
zoophytes
algae
and
crustaceans
with
enormous
quivering
claws
that
stretched
forth
from
crevices
in
the
rock
at
1015
captain
nemo
himself
took
the
helm
dark
and
deep
a
wide
gallery
opened
ahead
of
us
the
nautilus
was
brazenly
swallowed
up
strange
rumblings
were
audible
along
our
sides
it
was
the
water
of
the
red
sea
hurled
toward
the
mediterranean
by
the
tunnels
slope
our
engines
tried
to
offer
resistance
by
churning
the
waves
with
propeller
in
reverse
but
the
nautilus
went
with
the
torrent
as
swift
as
an
arrow
along
the
narrow
walls
of
this
passageway
i
saw
only
brilliant
streaks
hard
lines
fiery
furrows
all
scrawled
by
our
speeding
electric
light
with
my
hand
i
tried
to
curb
the
pounding
of
my
heart
at
1035
captain
nemo
left
the
steering
wheel
and
turned
to
me
the
mediterranean
he
told
me
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
swept
along
by
the
torrent
the
nautilus
had
just
cleared
the
isthmus
of
suez
chapter
6
the
greek
islands
at
sunrise
the
next
morning
february
12
the
nautilus
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
i
rushed
onto
the
platform
the
hazy
silhouette
of
pelusium
was
outlined
three
miles
to
the
south
a
torrent
had
carried
us
from
one
sea
to
the
other
but
although
that
tunnel
was
easy
to
descend
going
back
up
must
have
been
impossible
near
seven
oclock
ned
and
conseil
joined
me
those
two
inseparable
companions
had
slept
serenely
utterly
unaware
of
the
nautiluss
feat
well
mr
naturalist
the
canadian
asked
in
a
gently
mocking
tone
and
how
about
that
mediterranean
were
floating
on
its
surface
ned
my
friend
what
conseil
put
in
last
night




yes
last
night
in
a
matter
of
minutes
we
cleared
that
insuperable
isthmus
i
dont
believe
a
word
of
it
the
canadian
replied
and
youre
in
the
wrong
mr
land
i
went
on
that
flat
coastline
curving
southward
is
the
coast
of
egypt
tell
it
to
the
marines
sir
answered
the
stubborn
canadian
but
if
master
says
so
conseil
told
him
then
so
be
it
whats
more
ned
i
said
captain
nemo
himself
did
the
honors
in
his
tunnel
and
i
stood
beside
him
in
the
pilothouse
while
he
steered
the
nautilus
through
that
narrow
passageway
you
hear
ned
conseil
said
and
you
ned
who
have
such
good
eyes
i
added
you
can
spot
the
jetties
of
port
said
stretching
out
to
sea
the
canadian
looked
carefully
correct
he
said
youre
right
professor
and
your
captains
a
superman
were
in
the
mediterranean
fine
so
now
lets
have
a
chat
about
our
little
doings
if
you
please
but
in
such
a
way
that
nobody
overhears
i
could
easily
see
what
the
canadian
was
driving
at
in
any
event
i
thought
it
best
to
let
him
have
his
chat
and
we
all
three
went
to
sit
next
to
the
beacon
where
we
were
less
exposed
to
the
damp
spray
from
the
billows
now
ned
were
all
ears
i
said
what
have
you
to
tell
us
what
ive
got
to
tell
you
is
very
simple
the
canadian
replied
were
in
europe
and
before
captain
nemos
whims
take
us
deep
into
the
polar
seas
or
back
to
oceania
i
say
we
should
leave
this
nautilus
i
confess
that
such
discussions
with
the
canadian
always
baffled
me
i
didnt
want
to
restrict
my
companions
freedom
in
any
way
and
yet
i
had
no
desire
to
leave
captain
nemo
thanks
to
him
and
his
submersible
i
was
finishing
my
undersea
research
by
the
day
and
i
was
rewriting
my
book
on
the
great
ocean
depths
in
the
midst
of
its
very
element
would
i
ever
again
have
such
an
opportunity
to
observe
the
oceans
wonders
absolutely
not
so
i
couldnt
entertain
this
idea
of
leaving
the
nautilus
before
completing
our
course
of
inquiry
ned
my
friend
i
said
answer
me
honestly
are
you
bored
with
this
ship
are
you
sorry
that
fate
has
cast
you
into
captain
nemos
hands
the
canadian
paused
for
a
short
while
before
replying
then
crossing
his
arms
honestly
he
said
im
not
sorry
about
this
voyage
under
the
seas
ill
be
glad
to
have
done
it
but
in
order
to
have
done
it
it
has
to
finish
thats
my
feeling
it
will
finish
ned
where
and
when
where
i
dont
know
when
i
cant
say
or
rather
i
suppose
it
will
be
over
when
these
seas
have
nothing
more
to
teach
us
everything
that
begins
in
this
world
must
inevitably
come
to
an
end
i
think
as
master
does
conseil
replied
and
its
extremely
possible
that
after
crossing
every
sea
on
the
globe
captain
nemo
will
bid
the
three
of
us
a
fond
farewell
bid
us
a
fond
farewell
the
canadian
exclaimed
you
mean
beat
us
to
a
faretheewell
lets
not
exaggerate
mr
land
i
went
on
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
captain
but
neither
do
i
share
conseils
views
were
privy
to
the
nautiluss
secrets
and
i
dont
expect
that
its
commander
just
to
set
us
free
will
meekly
stand
by
while
we
spread
those
secrets
all
over
the
world
but
in
that
case
what
do
you
expect
the
canadian
asked
that
well
encounter
advantageous
conditions
for
escaping
just
as
readily
in
six
months
as
now
great
scott
ned
land
put
in
and
where
if
you
please
will
we
be
in
six
months
mr
naturalist
perhaps
here
perhaps
in
china
you
know
how
quickly
the
nautilus
moves
it
crosses
oceans
like
swallows
cross
the
air
or
express
trains
continents
it
doesnt
fear
heavily
traveled
seas
who
can
say
it
wont
hug
the
coasts
of
france
england
or
america
where
an
escape
attempt
could
be
carried
out
just
as
effectively
as
here
professor
aronnax
the
canadian
replied
your
arguments
are
rotten
to
the
core
you
talk
way
off
in
the
future
well
be
here
well
be
there
me
im
talking
about
right
now
we
are
here
and
we
must
take
advantage
of
it
i
was
hard
pressed
by
ned
lands
common
sense
and
i
felt
myself
losing
ground
i
no
longer
knew
what
arguments
to
put
forward
on
my
behalf
sir
ned
went
on
lets
suppose
that
by
some
impossibility
captain
nemo
offered
your
freedom
to
you
this
very
day
would
you
accept
i
dont
know
i
replied
and
suppose
he
adds
that
this
offer
hes
making
you
today
wont
ever
be
repeated
then
would
you
accept
i
did
not
reply
and
what
thinks
our
friend
conseil
ned
land
asked
your
friend
conseil
the
fine
lad
replied
serenely
has
nothing
to
say
for
himself
hes
a
completely
disinterested
party
on
this
question
like
his
master
like
his
comrade
ned
hes
a
bachelor
neither
wife
parents
nor
children
are
waiting
for
him
back
home
hes
in
masters
employ
he
thinks
like
master
he
speaks
like
master
and
much
to
his
regret
he
cant
be
counted
on
to
form
a
majority
only
two
persons
face
each
other
here
master
on
one
side
ned
land
on
the
other
that
said
your
friend
conseil
is
listening
and
hes
ready
to
keep
score
i
couldnt
help
smiling
as
conseil
wiped
himself
out
of
existence
deep
down
the
canadian
must
have
been
overjoyed
at
not
having
to
contend
with
him
then
sir
ned
land
said
since
conseil
is
no
more
well
have
this
discussion
between
just
the
two
of
us
ive
talked
youve
listened
whats
your
reply
it
was
obvious
that
the
matter
had
to
be
settled
and
evasions
were
distasteful
to
me
ned
my
friend
i
said
heres
my
reply
you
have
right
on
your
side
and
my
arguments
cant
stand
up
to
yours
it
will
never
do
to
count
on
captain
nemos
benevolence
the
most
ordinary
good
sense
would
forbid
him
to
set
us
free
on
the
other
hand
good
sense
decrees
that
we
take
advantage
of
our
first
opportunity
to
leave
the
nautilus
fine
professor
aronnax
thats
wisely
said
but
one
proviso
i
said
just
one
the
opportunity
must
be
the
real
thing
our
first
attempt
to
escape
must
succeed
because
if
it
misfires
we
wont
get
a
second
chance
and
captain
nemo
will
never
forgive
us
thats
also
well
put
the
canadian
replied
but
your
proviso
applies
to
any
escape
attempt
whether
it
happens
in
two
years
or
two
days
so
this
is
still
the
question
if
a
promising
opportunity
comes
up
we
have
to
grab
it
agreed
and
now
ned
will
you
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
a
promising
opportunity
one
that
leads
the
nautilus
on
a
cloudy
night
within
a
short
distance
of
some
european
coast
and
youll
try
to
get
away
by
swimming
yes
if
were
close
enough
to
shore
and
the
ships
afloat
on
the
surface
no
if
were
well
out
and
the
ships
navigating
under
the
waters
and
in
that
event
in
that
event
ill
try
to
get
hold
of
the
skiff
i
know
how
to
handle
it
well
stick
ourselves
inside
undo
the
bolts
and
rise
to
the
surface
without
the
helmsman
in
the
bow
seeing
a
thing
fine
ned
stay
on
the
lookout
for
such
an
opportunity
but

now
ned
would
you
like
to
know
my
overall
thinking
on
your
plan
gladly
professor
aronnax
well
then
i
thinkand
i
dont
mean
i
hopethat
your
promising
opportunity
wont
ever
arise
why
not
because
captain
nemo
recognizes
that
we
havent
given
up
all
hope
of
recovering
our
freedom
and
hell
keep
on
his
guard
above
all
in
seas
within
sight
of
the
coasts
of
europe

of
masters
opinion
conseil
said
well
soon
see
ned
land
replied
shaking
his
head
with
a
determined
expression
and
now
ned
land
i
added
lets
leave
it
at
that
not
another
word
on
any
of
this
the
day
youre
ready
alert
us
and
were
with
you
i
turn
it
all
over
to
you
thats
how
we
ended
this
conversation
which
later
was
to
have
such
serious
consequences
at
first
i
must
say
events
seemed
to
confirm
my
forecasts
much
to
the
canadians
despair
did
captain
nemo
view
us
with
distrust
in
these
heavily
traveled
seas
or
did
he
simply
want
to
hide
from
the
sight
of
those
ships
of
every
nation
that
plowed
the
mediterranean
i
have
no
idea
but
usually
he
stayed
in
midwater
and
well
out
from
any
coast
either
the
nautilus
surfaced
only
enough
to
let
its
pilothouse
emerge
or
it
slipped
away
to
the
lower
depths
although
between
the
greek
islands
and
asia
minor
we
didnt
find
bottom
even
at
2000
meters
down
accordingly
i
became
aware
of
the
isle
of
karpathos
one
of
the
sporades
islands
only
when
captain
nemo
placed
his
finger
over
a
spot
on
the
world
map
and
quoted
me
this
verse
from
virgil
est
in
carpathio
neptuni
gurgite
vates
caeruleus
proteus



latin
there
in
king
neptunes
domain
by
karpathos
his
spokesman

is
azurehued
proteus




ed
it
was
indeed
that
bygone
abode
of
proteus
the
old
shepherd
of
king
neptunes
flocks
an
island
located
between
rhodes
and
crete
which
greeks
now
call
karpathos
italians
scarpanto
through
the
lounge
window
i
could
see
only
its
granite
bedrock
the
next
day
february
14
i
decided
to
spend
a
few
hours
studying
the
fish
of
this
island
group
but
for
whatever
reason
the
panels
remained
hermetically
sealed
after
determining
the
nautiluss
heading
i
noted
that
it
was
proceeding
toward
the
ancient
island
of
crete
also
called
candia
at
the
time
i
had
shipped
aboard
the
abraham
lincoln
this
whole
island
was
in
rebellion
against
its
tyrannical
rulers
the
ottoman
empire
of
turkey
but
since
then
i
had
absolutely
no
idea
what
happened
to
this
revolution
and
captain
nemo
deprived
of
all
contact
with
the
shore
was
hardly
the
man
to
keep
me
informed
so
i
didnt
allude
to
this
event
when
that
evening
i
chanced
to
be
alone
with
the
captain
in
the
lounge
besides
he
seemed
silent
and
preoccupied
then
contrary
to
custom
he
ordered
that
both
panels
in
the
lounge
be
opened
and
going
from
the
one
to
the
other
he
carefully
observed
the
watery
mass
for
what
purpose
i
hadnt
a
guess
and
for
my
part
i
spent
my
time
studying
the
fish
that
passed
before
my
eyes
among
others
i
noted
that
sand
goby
mentioned
by
aristotle
and
commonly
known
by
the
name
sea
loach
which
is
encountered
exclusively
in
the
salty
waters
next
to
the
nile
delta
near
them
some
semiphosphorescent
red
porgy
rolled
by
a
variety
of
gilthead
that
the
egyptians
ranked
among
their
sacred
animals
lauding
them
in
religious
ceremonies
when
their
arrival
in
the
rivers
waters
announced
the
fertile
flood
season
i
also
noticed
some
wrasse
known
as
the
tapiro
three
decimeters
long
bony
fish
with
transparent
scales
whose
bluish
gray
color
is
mixed
with
red
spots
theyre
enthusiastic
eaters
of
marine
vegetables
which
gives
them
an
exquisite
flavor
hence
these
tapiro
were
much
in
demand
by
the
epicures
of
ancient
rome
and
their
entrails
were
dressed
with
brains
of
peacock
tongue
of
flamingo
and
testes
of
moray
to
make
that
divine
platter
that
so
enraptured
the
roman
emperor
vitellius
another
resident
of
these
seas
caught
my
attention
and
revived
all
my
memories
of
antiquity
this
was
the
remora
which
travels
attached
to
the
bellies
of
sharks
as
the
ancients
tell
it
when
these
little
fish
cling
to
the
undersides
of
a
ship
they
can
bring
it
to
a
halt
and
by
so
impeding
mark
antonys
vessel
during
the
battle
of
actium
one
of
them
facilitated
the
victory
of
augustus
caesar
from
such
slender
threads
hang
the
destinies
of
nations
i
also
observed
some
wonderful
snappers
belonging
to
the
order
lutianida
sacred
fish
for
the
greeks
who
claimed
they
could
drive
off
sea
monsters
from
the
waters
they
frequent
their
greek
name
anthias
means
flower
and
they
live
up
to
it
in
the
play
of
their
colors
and
in
those
fleeting
reflections
that
turn
their
dorsal
fins
into
watered
silk
their
hues
are
confined
to
a
gamut
of
reds
from
the
pallor
of
pink
to
the
glow
of
ruby
i
couldnt
take
my
eyes
off
these
marine
wonders
when
i
was
suddenly
jolted
by
an
unexpected
apparition
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
a
man
appeared
a
diver
carrying
a
little
leather
bag
at
his
belt
it
was
no
corpse
lost
in
the
waves
it
was
a
living
man
swimming
vigorously
sometimes
disappearing
to
breathe
at
the
surface
then
instantly
diving
again
i
turned
to
captain
nemo
and
in
an
agitated
voice
a
man
a
castaway
i
exclaimed
we
must
rescue
him
at
all
cost
the
captain
didnt
reply
but
went
to
lean
against
the
window
the
man
drew
near
and
gluing
his
face
to
the
panel
he
stared
at
us
to
my
deep
astonishment
captain
nemo
gave
him
a
signal
the
diver
answered
with
his
hand
immediately
swam
up
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
didnt
reappear
dont
be
alarmed
the
captain
told
me
thats
nicolas
from
cape
matapan
nicknamed
il
pesce
hes
well
known
throughout
the
cyclades
islands
a
bold
diver
water
is
his
true
element
and
he
lives
in
the
sea
more
than
on
shore
going
constantly
from
one
island
to
another
even
to
crete
italian
the
fish
ed
you
know
him
captain
why
not
professor
aronnax
this
said
captain
nemo
went
to
a
cabinet
standing
near
the
lounges
left
panel
next
to
this
cabinet
i
saw
a
chest
bound
with
hoops
of
iron
its
lid
bearing
a
copper
plaque
that
displayed
the
nautiluss
monogram
with
its
motto
mobilis
in
mobili
just
then
ignoring
my
presence
the
captain
opened
this
cabinet
a
sort
of
safe
that
contained
a
large
number
of
ingots
they
were
gold
ingots
and
they
represented
an
enormous
sum
of
money
where
had
this
precious
metal
come
from
how
had
the
captain
amassed
this
gold
and
what
was
he
about
to
do
with
it
i
didnt
pronounce
a
word
i
gaped
captain
nemo
took
out
the
ingots
one
by
one
and
arranged
them
methodically
inside
the
chest
filling
it
to
the
top
at
which
point
i
estimate
that
it
held
more
than
1000
kilograms
of
gold
in
other
words
close
to
5000000
francs
after
securely
fastening
the
chest
captain
nemo
wrote
an
address
on
its
lid
in
characters
that
must
have
been
modern
greek
this
done
the
captain
pressed
a
button
whose
wiring
was
in
communication
with
the
crews
quarters
four
men
appeared
and
not
without
difficulty
pushed
the
chest
out
of
the
lounge
then
i
heard
them
hoist
it
up
the
iron
companionway
by
means
of
pulleys
just
then
captain
nemo
turned
to
me
you
were
saying
professor
he
asked
me
i
wasnt
saying
a
thing
captain
then
sir
with
your
permission
ill
bid
you
good
evening
and
with
that
captain
nemo
left
the
lounge
i
reentered
my
stateroom
very
puzzled
as
you
can
imagine
i
tried
in
vain
to
fall
asleep
i
kept
searching
for
a
relationship
between
the
appearance
of
the
diver
and
that
chest
filled
with
gold
soon
from
certain
rolling
and
pitching
movements
i
sensed
that
the
nautilus
had
left
the
lower
strata
and
was
back
on
the
surface
of
the
water
then
i
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
platform
i
realized
that
the
skiff
was
being
detached
and
launched
to
sea
for
an
instant
it
bumped
the
nautiluss
side
then
all
sounds
ceased
two
hours
later
the
same
noises
the
same
comings
and
goings
were
repeated
hoisted
on
board
the
longboat
was
readjusted
into
its
socket
and
the
nautilus
plunged
back
beneath
the
waves
so
those
millions
had
been
delivered
to
their
address
at
what
spot
on
the
continent
who
was
the
recipient
of
captain
nemos
gold
the
next
day
i
related
the
nights
events
to
conseil
and
the
canadian
events
that
had
aroused
my
curiosity
to
a
fever
pitch
my
companions
were
as
startled
as
i
was
but
where
does
he
get
those
millions
ned
land
asked
to
this
no
reply
was
possible
after
breakfast
i
made
my
way
to
the
lounge
and
went
about
my
work
i
wrote
up
my
notes
until
five
oclock
in
the
afternoon
just
thenwas
it
due
to
some
personal
indispositioni
felt
extremely
hot
and
had
to
take
off
my
jacket
made
of
fan
mussel
fabric
a
perplexing
circumstance
because
we
werent
in
the
low
latitudes
and
besides
once
the
nautilus
was
submerged
it
shouldnt
be
subject
to
any
rise
in
temperature
i
looked
at
the
pressure
gauge
it
marked
a
depth
of
sixty
feet
a
depth
beyond
the
reach
of
atmospheric
heat
i
kept
on
working
but
the
temperature
rose
to
the
point
of
becoming
unbearable
could
there
be
a
fire
on
board
i
wondered
i
was
about
to
leave
the
lounge
when
captain
nemo
entered
he
approached
the
thermometer
consulted
it
and
turned
to
me
42
degrees
centigrade
he
said
ive
detected
as
much
captain
i
replied
and
if
it
gets
even
slightly
hotter
we
wont
be
able
to
stand
it
oh
professor
it
wont
get
any
hotter
unless
we
want
it
to
you
mean
you
can
control
this
heat
no
but
i
can
back
away
from
the
fireplace
producing
it
so
its
outside
surely
were
cruising
in
a
current
of
boiling
water
it
cant
be
i
exclaimed
look
the
panels
had
opened
and
i
could
see
a
completely
white
sea
around
the
nautilus
steaming
sulfurous
fumes
uncoiled
in
the
midst
of
waves
bubbling
like
water
in
a
boiler
i
leaned
my
hand
against
one
of
the
windows
but
the
heat
was
so
great
i
had
to
snatch
it
back
where
are
we
i
asked
near
the
island
of
santorini
professor
the
captain
answered
me
and
right
in
the
channel
that
separates
the
volcanic
islets
of
nea
kameni
and
palea
kameni
i
wanted
to
offer
you
the
unusual
sight
of
an
underwater
eruption
i
thought
i
said
that
the
formation
of
such
new
islands
had
come
to
an
end
nothing
ever
comes
to
an
end
in
these
volcanic
waterways
captain
nemo
replied
and
thanks
to
its
underground
fires
our
globe
is
continuously
under
construction
in
these
regions
according
to
the
latin
historians
cassiodorus
and
pliny
by
the
year
19
of
the
christian
era
a
new
island
the
divine
thera
had
already
appeared
in
the
very
place
these
islets
have
more
recently
formed
then
thera
sank
under
the
waves
only
to
rise
and
sink
once
more
in
the
year
69
ad
from
that
day
to
this
such
plutonic
construction
work
has
been
in
abeyance
but
on
february
3
1866
a
new
islet
named
george
island
emerged
in
the
midst
of
sulfurous
steam
near
nea
kameni
and
was
fused
to
it
on
the
6th
of
the
same
month
seven
days
later
on
february
13
the
islet
of
aphroessa
appeared
leaving
a
tenmeter
channel
between
itself
and
nea
kameni
i
was
in
these
seas
when
that
phenomenon
occurred
and
i
was
able
to
observe
its
every
phase
the
islet
of
aphroessa
was
circular
in
shape
measuring
300
feet
in
diameter
and
thirty
feet
in
height
it
was
made
of
black
glassy
lava
mixed
with

a
smaller
islet
called
reka
appeared
next
to
nea
kameni
and
since
then
these
three
islets
have
fused
to
form
one
single
selfsame
island
what
about
this
channel
were
in
right
now
i
asked
here
it
is
captain
nemo
replied
showing
me
a
chart
of
the
greek
islands
you
observe
that
ive
entered
the
new
islets
in
their
place
but
will
this
channel
fill
up
one
day
very
likely
professor
aronnax
because
since
1866
eight
little
lava
islets
have
surged
up
in
front
of
the
port
of
st
nicolas
on
palea
kameni
so
its
obvious
that
nea
and
palea
will
join
in
days
to
come
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
tiny
infusoria
build
continents
but
here
theyre
built
by
volcanic
phenomena
look
sir
look
at
the
construction
work
going
on
under
these
waves
i
returned
to
the
window
the
nautilus
was
no
longer
moving
the
heat
had
become
unbearable
from
the
white
it
had
recently
been
the
sea
was
turning
red
a
coloration
caused
by
the
presence
of
iron
salts
although
the
lounge
was
hermetically
sealed
it
was
filling
with
an
intolerable
stink
of
sulfur
and
i
could
see
scarlet
flames
of
such
brightness
they
overpowered
our
electric
light
i
was
swimming
in
perspiration
i
was
stifling
i
was
about
to
be
cooked
yes
i
felt
myself
cooking
in
actual
fact
we
cant
stay
any
longer
in
this
boiling
water
i
told
the
captain
no
it
wouldnt
be
advisable
replied
nemo
the
emotionless
he
gave
an
order
the
nautilus
tacked
about
and
retreated
from
this
furnace
it
couldnt
brave
with
impunity
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
were
breathing
fresh
air
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
it
then
occurred
to
me
that
if
ned
had
chosen
these
waterways
for
our
escape
attempt
we
wouldnt
have
come
out
alive
from
this
sea
of
fire
the
next
day
february
16
we
left
this
basin
which
tallies
depths
of
3000
meters
between
rhodes
and
alexandria
and
passing
well
out
from
cerigo
island
after
doubling

the

continuously
under

this

where
neptune

struggle

here
on

says
the

michelet
a
man
is
revived
by
one
of
the
most
invigorating
climates
in
the
world
latin
our
sea
ed
but
as
beautiful
as
it
was
i
could
get
only
a
quick
look
at
this
basin
whose
surface
area
comprises
2000000
square
kilometers
even
captain
nemos
personal
insights
were
denied
me
because
that
mystifying
individual
didnt
appear
one
single
time
during
our
highspeed
crossing
i
estimate
that
the
nautilus
covered
a
track
of
some
600
leagues
under
the
waves
of
this
sea
and
this
voyage
was
accomplished
in
just
twentyfour
hours
times
two
departing
from
the
waterways
of
greece
on
the
morning
of
february
16
we
cleared
the
strait
of
gibraltar
by
sunrise
on
the
18th
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
this
mediterranean
pinned
in
the
middle
of
those
shores
he
wanted
to
avoid
gave
captain
nemo
no
pleasure
its
waves
and
breezes
brought
back
too
many
memories
if
not
too
many
regrets
here
he
no
longer
had
the
ease
of
movement
and
freedom
of
maneuver
that
the
oceans
allowed
him
and
his
nautilus
felt
cramped
so
close
to
the
coasts
of
both
africa
and
europe
accordingly
our
speed
was
twentyfive
miles
that
is
twelve
fourkilometer
leagues
per
hour
needless
to
say
ned
land
had
to
give
up
his
escape
plans
much
to
his
distress
swept
along
at
the
rate
of
twelve
to
thirteen
meters
per
second
he
could
hardly
make
use
of
the
skiff
leaving
the
nautilus
under
these
conditions
would
have
been
like
jumping
off
a
train
racing
at
this
speed
a
rash
move
if
there
ever
was
one
moreover
to
renew
our
air
supply
the
submersible
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
only
at
night
and
relying
solely
on
compass
and
log
it
steered
by
dead
reckoning
inside
the
mediterranean
then
i
could
catch
no
more
of
its
fastpassing
scenery
than
a
traveler
might
see
from
an
express
train
in
other
words
i
could
view
only
the
distant
horizons
because
the
foregrounds
flashed
by
like
lightning
but
conseil
and
i
were
able
to
observe
those
mediterranean
fish
whose
powerful
fins
kept
pace
for
a
while
in
the
nautiluss
waters
we
stayed
on
watch
before
the
lounge
windows
and
our
notes
enable
me
to
reconstruct
in
a
few
words
the
ichthyology
of
this
sea
among
the
various
fish
inhabiting
it
some
i
viewed
others
i
glimpsed
and
the
rest
i
missed
completely
because
of
the
nautiluss
speed
kindly
allow
me
to
sort
them
out
using
this
whimsical
system
of
classification
it
will
at
least
convey
the
quickness
of
my
observations
in
the
midst
of
the
watery
mass
brightly
lit
by
our
electric
beams
there
snaked
past
those
onemeter
lampreys
that
are
common
to
nearly
every
clime
a
type
of
ray
from
the
genus
oxyrhynchus
five
feet
wide
had
a
white
belly
with
a
spotted
ashgray
back
and
was
carried
along
by
the
currents
like
a
huge
wideopen
shawl
other
rays
passed
by
so
quickly
i
couldnt
tell
if
they
deserved
that
name
eagle

coined
by
the
ancient
greeks
or
those
designations
of
rat

that
modern

have
inflicted
on
them

as

in

which
contrasted
with
the
dark
color
of
their

fish
sacred
to
the
goddess
venus
their
eyes
set
in

that
patronizes
all
waters
fresh

equally
at

in

and
oceans
living
in
every

their

prehistoric
times

preserving
all
its

from
those
faroff
days
magnificent
sturgeons
nine

ten
meters
long
and
extremely
fast

their
powerful
tails
against
the
glass
of
our
panels
showing
bluish
backs
with
small
brown
spots
they
resemble
sharks
without
equaling
their
strength
and
are
encountered
in
every
sea
in
the
spring
they
delight
in
swimming
up
the
great
rivers
fighting
the

of
the
volga

po

while
feeding
on
herring
mackerel
salmon
and
codfish
although
they
belong
to
the
class
of
cartilaginous
fish
they
rate
as
a
delicacy
theyre
eaten
fresh
dried
marinated
or
saltpreserved
and
in
olden
times
they
were
borne
in
triumph
to
the
table
of
the
roman
epicure
lucullus
but
whenever
the
nautilus
drew
near
the
surface
those
denizens
of
the
mediterranean
i
could
observe
most
productively
belonged
to
the
sixtythird
genus
of
bony
fish
these
were
tuna
from
the
genus
scomber
blueblack
on
top
silver
on
the
belly
armor
their
dorsal
stripes
giving
off
a
golden
gleam
they
are
said
to
follow
ships
in
search
of
refreshing
shade
from
the
hot
tropical
sun
and
they
did
just
that
with
the
nautilus
as
they
had
once
done
with
the
vessels
of
the
count
de
la
prouse
for
long
hours
they
competed
in
speed
with
our
submersible
i
couldnt
stop
marveling
at
these
animals
so
perfectly
cut
out
for
racing
their
heads
small
their
bodies
sleek
spindleshaped
and
in
some
cases
over
three
meters
long
their
pectoral
fins
gifted
with
remarkable
strength
their
caudal
fins
forked
like
certain
flocks
of
birds
whose
speed
they
equal
these
tuna
swim
in
triangle
formation
which
prompted
the
ancients
to
say
theyd
boned
up
on
geometry
and
military
strategy
and
yet
they
cant
escape
the
provenal
fishermen
who
prize
them
as
highly
as
did
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
turkey
and
italy
and
these
valuable
animals
as
oblivious
as
if
they
were
deaf
and
blind
leap
right
into
the
marseilles
tuna
nets
and
perish
by
the
thousands
just
for
the
record
ill
mention
those
mediterranean
fish
that
conseil
and
i
barely
glimpsed
there
were
whitish
eels
of
the
species
gymnotus
fasciatus
that
passed
like
elusive
wisps
of
steam
conger
eels
three
to
four
meters
long
that
were
tricked
out
in
green
blue
and
yellow
threefoot
hake
with
a
liver
that
makes
a
dainty
morsel
wormfish
drifting
like
thin
seaweed
sea
robins
that
poets
call
lyrefish
and

and
whose
snouts
have
two
jagged
triangular
plates
shaped
like
old
homers
lyre
swallowfish
swimming
as
fast
as
the
bird
theyre
named
after
redheaded
groupers
whose
dorsal
fins
are
trimmed
with
filaments
some
shad
spotted
with
black
gray
brown
blue
yellow
and
green
that
actually
respond
to
tinkling
handbells
splendid
diamondshaped
turbot
that
were
like
aquatic
pheasants
with
yellowish
fins
stippled
in
brown
and
the
left
topside
mostly
marbled
in
brown
and
yellow
finally
schools
of
wonderful
red
mullet
real
oceanic
birds
of
paradise
that
ancient
romans
bought
for
as
much
as
10000
sesterces
apiece
and
which
they
killed
at
the
table
so
they
could
heartlessly
watch
it
change
color
from
cinnabar
red
when
alive
to
pallid
white
when
dead
and
as
for
other
fish
common
to
the
atlantic
and
mediterranean
i
was
unable
to
observe
miralets
triggerfish

seahorses
jewelfish
trumpetfish
blennies
gray
mullet
wrasse

chief
representatives
of
the
order
pleuronecta
such
as
sole
flounder
plaice
dab
and
brill
simply
because
of
the
dizzying
speed
with
which
the
nautilus
hustled
through
these
opulent
waters
as
for
marine
mammals
on
passing
by
the
mouth
of
the
adriatic
sea
i
thought
i
recognized
two
or
three
sperm
whales
equipped
with
the
single
dorsal
fin
denoting
the
genus
physeter
some
pilot
whales
from
the
genus
globicephalus
exclusive
to
the
mediterranean
the
forepart
of
the
head
striped
with
small
distinct
lines
and
also
a
dozen
seals
with
white
bellies
and
black
coats
known
by
the
name
monk
seals
and
just
as
solemn
as
if
they
were
threemeter
dominicans
for
his
part
conseil
thought
he
spotted
a
turtle
six
feet
wide
and
adorned
with
three
protruding
ridges
that
ran
lengthwise
i
was
sorry
to
miss
this
reptile
because
from
conseils
description
i
believe
i
recognized
the
leatherback
turtle
a
pretty
rare
species
for
my
part
i
noted
only
some
loggerhead
turtles
with
long
carapaces
as
for
zoophytes
for
a
few
moments
i
was
able
to
marvel
at
a
wonderful
orangehued
hydra
from
the
genus
galeolaria
that
clung
to
the
glass
of
our
port
panel
it
consisted
of
a
long
lean
filament
that
spread
out
into
countless
branches
and
ended
in
the
most
delicate
lace
ever
spun
by
the
followers
of
arachne
unfortunately
i
couldnt
fish
up
this
wonderful
specimen
and
surely
no
other
mediterranean
zoophytes
would
have
been
offered
to
my
gaze
if
on
the
evening
of
the
16th
the
nautilus
hadnt
slowed
down
in
an
odd
fashion
this
was
the
situation
by
then
we
were
passing
between
sicily
and
the
coast
of
tunisia
in
the
cramped
space
between
cape
bon
and
the
strait
of
messina
the
sea
bottom
rises
almost
all
at
once
it
forms
an
actual
ridge
with
only
seventeen
meters
of
water
remaining
above
it
while
the
depth
on
either
side
is
170
meters
consequently
the
nautilus
had
to
maneuver
with
caution
so
as
not
to
bump
into
this
underwater
barrier
i
showed
conseil
the
position
of
this
long
reef
on
our
chart
of
the
mediterranean
but
with
all
due
respect
to
master
conseil
ventured
to
observe
its
like
an
actual
isthmus
connecting
europe
to
africa
yes
my
boy
i
replied
it
cuts
across
the
whole
strait
of
sicily
and
smiths
soundings
prove
that
in
the
past
these
two
continents
were
genuinely
connected
between
cape
boeo
and
cape
farina
i
can
easily
believe
it
conseil
said
i
might
add
i
went
on
that
theres
a
similar
barrier
between
gibraltar
and
ceuta
and
in
prehistoric
times
it
closed
off
the
mediterranean
completely
gracious
conseil
put
in
suppose
one
day
some
volcanic
upheaval
raises
these
two
barriers
back
above
the
waves
thats
most
unlikely
conseil
if
master
will
allow
me
to
finish
i
mean
that
if
this
phenomenon
occurs
it
might
prove
distressing
to
mr
de
lesseps
who
has
gone
to
such
pains
to
cut
through
his
isthmus
agreed
but
i
repeat
conseil
such
a
phenomenon
wont
occur
the
intensity
of
these
underground
forces
continues
to
diminish
volcanoes
were
quite
numerous
in
the
worlds
early
days
but
theyre
going
extinct
one
by
one
the
heat
inside
the
earth
is
growing
weaker
the
temperature
in
the
globes
lower
strata
is
cooling
appreciably
every
century
and
to
our
globes
detriment
because
its
heat
is
its
life
but
the
sun
the
sun
isnt
enough
conseil
can
it
restore
heat
to
a
corpse
not
that
ive
heard
well
my
friend
someday
the
earth
will
be
just
such
a
cold
corpse
like
the
moon
which
long
ago
lost
its
vital
heat
our
globe
will
become
lifeless
and
unlivable
in
how
many
centuries

has
very
appropriately
divided
them
into
six
classes
three
of
which
belong
to
the
marine
world
these
classes
are
the
crustacea
cirripedia
and
annelida
crustaceans
are
subdivided
into
nine
orders
and
the
first
of
these
consists
of
the
decapods
in
other
words
animals
whose
head
and
thorax
are
usually
fused
whose
cheekandmouth
mechanism
is
made
up
of
several
pairs
of
appendages
and
whose
thorax
has
four
five
or
six
pairs
of
walking
legs
conseil
used
the
methods
of
our
mentor
professor
milneedwards
who
puts
the
decapods
in
three
divisions
brachyura
macrura
and
anomura
these
names
may
look
a
tad
fierce
but
theyre
accurate
and
appropriate
among
the
brachyura
conseil
mentions
some
amanthia
crabs
whose
fronts
were
armed
with
two
big
diverging

they
usually

among
the

which
are
subdivided
into
five
families
hardshells
burrowers
crayfish
prawns
and
ghost
crabs
conseil
mentions
some
common
spiny
lobsters
whose
females
supply
a
meat
highly
prized
slipper
lobsters
or
common
shrimp
waterside
gebia
shrimp
and
all
sorts
of
edible
species
but
he
says
nothing
of
the
crayfish
subdivision
that
includes
the
true
lobster
because
spiny
lobsters
are
the
only
type
in
the
mediterranean
finally
among
the
anomura
he
saw
common
drocina
crabs
dwelling
inside
whatever
abandoned
seashells
they
could
take
over
homola
crabs

spiny
fronts

etc
there
conseils
work
came
to
a
halt
he
didnt
have
time
to
finish
off
the
class
crustacea
through
an
examination
of
its
stomatopods
amphipods
homopods
isopods
trilobites
branchiopods
ostracods
and
entomostraceans
and
in
order
to
complete
his
study
of
marine
articulates
he
needed
to
mention
the
class
cirripedia
which
contains
water
fleas
and
carp
lice
plus
the
class
annelida
which
he
would
have
divided
without
fail
into
tubifex
worms
and
dorsibranchian
worms
but
having
gone
past
the
shallows
of
the
strait
of
sicily
the
nautilus
resumed
its
usual
deepwater
speed
from
then
on
no
more

no
more

no
more

just
a
few
large
fish
sweeping
by
like
shadows
during
the
night
of
february
1617
we
entered
the
second
mediterranean
basin
whose
maximum
depth
we
found
at
3000
meters
the
nautilus
driven
downward
by
its
propeller
and
slanting
fins
descended
to
the
lowest
strata
of
this
sea
there
in
place
of
natural
wonders
the
watery
mass
offered
some
thrilling
and
dreadful
scenes
to
my
eyes
in
essence
we
were
then
crossing
that
part
of
the
whole
mediterranean
so
fertile
in
casualties
from
the
coast
of
algiers
to
the
beaches
of
provence
how
many
ships
have
wrecked
how
many
vessels
have
vanished
compared
to
the
vast
liquid
plains
of
the
pacific
the
mediterranean
is
a
mere
lake
but
its
an
unpredictable
lake
with
fickle
waves
today
kindly
and
affectionate
to
those
frail
singlemasters
drifting
between
a
double
ultramarine
of
sky
and
water
tomorrow
badtempered
and
turbulent
agitated
by
the
winds
demolishing
the
strongest
ships
beneath
sudden
waves
that
smash
down
with
a
headlong
wallop
so
in
our
swift
cruise
through
these
deep
strata
how
many
vessels
i
saw
lying
on
the
seafloor
some
already
caked
with
coral
others
clad
only
in
a
layer
of
rust
plus
anchors
cannons
shells
iron
fittings
propeller
blades
parts
of
engines
cracked
cylinders
stavedin
boilers
then
hulls
floating
in
midwater
here
upright
there
overturned
some
of
these
wrecked
ships
had
perished
in
collisions
others
from
hitting
granite
reefs
i
saw
a
few
that
had
sunk
straight
down
their
masting
still
upright
their
rigging
stiffened
by
the
water
they
looked
like
they
were
at
anchor
by
some
immense
open
offshore
mooring
where
they
were
waiting
for
their
departure
time
when
the
nautilus
passed
between
them
covering
them
with
sheets
of
electricity
they
seemed
ready
to
salute
us
with
their
colors
and
send
us
their
serial
numbers
but
no
nothing
but
silence
and
death
filled
this
field
of
catastrophes
i
observed
that
these
mediterranean
depths
became
more
and
more
cluttered
with
such
gruesome
wreckage
as
the
nautilus
drew
nearer
to
the
strait
of
gibraltar
by
then
the
shores
of
africa
and
europe
were
converging
and
in
this
narrow
space
collisions
were
commonplace
there
i
saw
numerous
iron
undersides
the
phantasmagoric
ruins
of
steamers
some
lying
down
others
rearing
up
like
fearsome
animals
one
of
these
boats
made
a
dreadful
first
impression

torn
open
funnel
bent
paddle

stripped
to
the
mountings
rudder
separated
from
the

and
still
hanging
from
an
iron
chain
the
board
on
its
stern
eaten
away
by
marine
salts
how
many
lives
were
dashed
in
this
shipwreck
how
many
victims
were
swept
under
the
waves
had
some
sailor
on
board
lived
to
tell
the
story
of
this
dreadful
disaster
or
do
the
waves
still
keep
this
casualty
a
secret
it
occurred
to
me
lord
knows
why
that
this
boat
buried
under
the
sea
might
have
been
the
atlas
lost
with
all
hands
some
twenty
years
ago
and
never
heard
from
again
oh
what
a
gruesome
tale
these
mediterranean
depths
could
tell
this
huge
boneyard
where
so
much
wealth
has
been
lost
where
so
many
victims
have
met
their
deaths
meanwhile
briskly
unconcerned
the
nautilus
ran
at
full
propeller
through
the
midst
of
these
ruins
on
february
18
near
three
oclock
in
the
morning
it
hove
before
the
entrance
to
the
strait
of
gibraltar
there
are
two
currents
here
an
upper
current
long
known
to
exist
that
carries
the
oceans
waters
into
the
mediterranean
basin
then
a
lower
countercurrent
the
only
presentday
proof
of
its
existence
being
logic
in
essence
the
mediterranean
receives
a
continual
influx
of
water
not
only
from
the
atlantic
but
from
rivers
emptying
into
it
since
local
evaporation
isnt
enough
to
restore
the
balance
the
total
amount
of
added
water
should
make
this
seas
level
higher
every
year
yet
this
isnt
the
case
and
were
naturally
forced
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
some
lower
current
that
carries
the
mediterraneans
surplus
through
the
strait
of
gibraltar
and
into
the
atlantic
basin
and
so
it
turned
out
the
nautilus
took
full
advantage
of
this
countercurrent
it
advanced
swiftly
through
this
narrow
passageway
for
an
instant
i
could
glimpse
the
wonderful
ruins
of
the
temple
of
hercules
buried
undersea
as
pliny

have
mentioned
together
with
the

stand

a

later
we

where
were
we
heading
now
and
what
did
the
future
have
in
store
for
us
emerging
from
the
strait
of
gibraltar
the
nautilus
took
to
the
high
seas
it
returned
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
so
our
daily
strolls
on
the
platform
were
restored
to
us
i
climbed
onto
it
instantly
ned
land
and
conseil
along
with
me
twelve
miles
away
cape
st
vincent
was
hazily
visible
the
southwestern
tip
of
the
hispanic
peninsula
the
wind
was
blowing
a
pretty
strong
gust
from
the
south
the
sea
was
swelling
and
surging
its
waves
made
the
nautilus
roll
and
jerk
violently
it
was
nearly
impossible
to
stand
up
on
the
platform
which
was
continuously
buffeted
by
this
enormously
heavy
sea
after
inhaling
a
few
breaths
of
air
we
went
below
once
more
i
repaired
to
my
stateroom
conseil
returned
to
his
cabin
but
the
canadian
looking
rather
worried
followed
me
our
quick
trip
through
the
mediterranean
hadnt
allowed
him
to
put
his
plans
into
execution
and
he
could
barely
conceal
his
disappointment
after
the
door
to
my
stateroom
was
closed
he
sat
and
stared
at
me
silently
ned
my
friend
i
told
him
i
know
how
you
feel
but
you
mustnt
blame
yourself
given
the
way
the
nautilus
was
navigating
it
would
have
been
sheer
insanity
to
think
of
escaping
ned
land
didnt
reply
his
pursed
lips
and
frowning
brow
indicated
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
his
monomania
look
here
i
went
on
as
yet
theres
no
cause
for
despair
were
going
up
the
coast
of
portugal
france
and
england
arent
far
off
and
there
well
easily
find
refuge
oh
i
grant
you
if
the
nautilus
had
emerged
from
the
strait
of
gibraltar
and
made
for
that
cape
in
the
south
if
it
were
taking
us
toward
those
regions
that
have
no
continents
then
id
share
your
alarm
but
we
now
know
that
captain
nemo
doesnt
avoid
the
seas
of
civilization
and
in
a
few
days
i
think
we
can
safely
take
action
ned
land
stared
at
me
still
more
intently
and
finally
unpursed
his
lips
well
do
it
this
evening
he
said
i
straightened
suddenly
i
admit
that
i
was
less
than
ready
for
this
announcement
i
wanted
to
reply
to
the
canadian
but
words
failed
me
we
agreed
to
wait
for
the
right
circumstances
ned
land
went
on
now
weve
got
those
circumstances
this
evening
well
be
just
a
few
miles
off
the
coast
of
spain
itll
be
cloudy
tonight
the
winds
blowing
toward
shore
you
gave
me
your
promise
professor
aronnax
and
im
counting
on
you
since
i
didnt
say
anything
the
canadian
stood
up
and
approached
me
well
do
it
this
evening
at
nine
oclock
he
said
ive
alerted
conseil
by
that
time
captain
nemo
will
be
locked
in
his
room
and
probably
in
bed
neither
the
mechanics
or
the
crewmen
will
be
able
to
see
us
conseil
and
i
will
go
to
the
central
companionway
as
for
you
professor
aronnax
youll
stay
in
the
library
two
steps
away
and
wait
for
my
signal
the
oars
mast
and
sail
are
in
the
skiff
ive
even
managed
to
stow
some
provisions
inside
ive
gotten
hold
of
a
monkey
wrench
to
unscrew
the
nuts
bolting
the
skiff
to
the
nautiluss
hull
so
everythings
ready
ill
see
you
this
evening
the
sea
is
rough
i
said
admitted
the
canadian
replied
but
weve
got
to
risk
it
freedom
is
worth
paying
for
besides
the
longboats
solidly
built
and
a
few
miles
with
the
wind
behind
us
is
no
big
deal
by
tomorrow
who
knows
if
this
ship
wont
be
100
leagues
out
to
sea
if
circumstances
are
in
our
favor
between
ten
and
eleven
this
evening
well
be
landing
on
some
piece
of
solid
ground
or
well
be
dead
so
were
in
gods
hands
and
ill
see
you
this
evening
this
said
the
canadian
withdrew
leaving
me
close
to
dumbfounded
i
had
imagined
that
if
it
came
to
this
i
would
have
time
to
think
about
it
to
talk
it
over
my
stubborn
companion
hadnt
granted
me
this
courtesy
but
after
all
what
would
i
have
said
to
him
ned
land
was
right
a
hundred
times
over
these
were
nearideal
circumstances
and
he
was
taking
full
advantage
of
them
in
my
selfish
personal
interests
could
i
go
back
on
my
word
and
be
responsible
for
ruining
the
future
lives
of
my
companions
tomorrow
might
not
captain
nemo
take
us
far
away
from
any
shore
just
then
a
fairly
loud
hissing
told
me
that
the
ballast
tanks
were
filling
and
the
nautilus
sank
beneath
the
waves
of
the
atlantic
i
stayed
in
my
stateroom
i
wanted
to
avoid
the
captain
to
hide
from
his
eyes
the
agitation
overwhelming
me
what
an
agonizing
day
i
spent
torn
between
my
desire
to
regain
my
free
will
and
my
regret
at
abandoning
this
marvelous
nautilus
leaving
my
underwater
research
incomplete
how
could
i
relinquish
this
oceanmy
own
atlantic
as
i
liked
to
call
itwithout
observing
its
lower
strata
without
wresting
from
it
the
kinds
of
secrets
that
had
been
revealed
to
me
by
the
seas
of
the
east
indies
and
the
pacific
i
was
putting
down
my
novel
half
read
i
was
waking
up
as
my
dream
neared
its
climax
how
painfully
the
hours
passed
as
i
sometimes
envisioned
myself
safe
on
shore
with
my
companions
or
despite
my
better
judgment
as
i
sometimes
wished
that
some
unforeseen
circumstances
would
prevent
ned
land
from
carrying
out
his
plans
twice
i
went
to
the
lounge
i
wanted
to
consult
the
compass
i
wanted
to
see
if
the
nautiluss
heading
was
actually
taking
us
closer
to
the
coast
or
spiriting
us
farther
away
but
no
the
nautilus
was
still
in
portuguese
waters
heading
north
it
was
cruising
along
the
oceans
beaches
so
i
had
to
resign
myself
to
my
fate
and
get
ready
to
escape
my
baggage
wasnt
heavy
my
notes
nothing
more
as
for
captain
nemo
i
wondered
what
he
would
make
of
our
escaping
what
concern
or
perhaps
what
distress
it
might
cause
him
and
what
he
would
do
in
the
twofold
event
of
our
attempt
either
failing
or
being
found
out
certainly
i
had
no
complaints
to
register
with
him
on
the
contrary
never
was
hospitality
more
wholehearted
than
his
yet
in
leaving
him
i
couldnt
be
accused
of
ingratitude
no
solemn
promises
bound
us
to
him
in
order
to
keep
us
captive
he
had
counted
only
on
the
force
of
circumstances
and
not
on
our
word
of
honor
but
his
avowed
intention
to
imprison
us
forever
on
his
ship
justified
our
every
effort
i
hadnt
seen
the
captain
since
our
visit
to
the
island
of
santorini
would
fate
bring
me
into
his
presence
before
our
departure
i
both
desired
and
dreaded
it
i
listened
for
footsteps
in
the
stateroom
adjoining
mine
not
a
sound
reached
my
ear
his
stateroom
had
to
be
deserted
then
i
began
to
wonder
if
this
eccentric
individual
was
even
on
board
since
that
night
when
the
skiff
had
left
the
nautilus
on
some
mysterious
mission
my
ideas
about
him
had
subtly
changed
in
spite
of
everything
i
thought
that
captain
nemo
must
have
kept
up
some
type
of
relationship
with
the
shore
did
he
himself
never
leave
the
nautilus
whole
weeks
had
often
gone
by
without
my
encountering
him
what
was
he
doing
all
the
while
during
all
those
times
id
thought
he
was
convalescing
in
the
grip
of
some
misanthropic
fit
was
he
instead
far
away
from
the
ship
involved
in
some
secret
activity
whose
nature
still
eluded
me
all
these
ideas
and
a
thousand
others
assaulted
me
at
the
same
time
in
these
strange
circumstances
the
scope
for
conjecture
was
unlimited
i
felt
an
unbearable
queasiness
this
day
of
waiting
seemed
endless
the
hours
struck
too
slowly
to
keep
up
with
my
impatience
as
usual
dinner
was
served
me
in
my
stateroom
full
of
anxiety
i
ate
little
i
left
the
table
at
seven
oclock
120
minutesi
was
keeping
track
of
themstill
separated
me
from
the
moment
i
was
to
rejoin
ned
land
my
agitation
increased
my
pulse
was
throbbing
violently
i
couldnt
stand
still
i
walked
up
and
down
hoping
to
calm
my
troubled
mind
with
movement
the
possibility
of
perishing
in
our
reckless
undertaking
was
the
least
of
my
worries
my
heart
was
pounding
at
the
thought
that
our
plans
might
be
discovered
before
we
had
left
the
nautilus
at
the
thought
of
being
hauled
in
front
of
captain
nemo
and
finding
him
angered
or
worse
saddened
by
my
deserting
him
i
wanted
to
see
the
lounge
one
last
time
i
went
down
the
gangways
and
arrived
at
the
museum
where
i
had
spent
so
many
pleasant
and
productive
hours
i
stared
at
all
its
wealth
all
its
treasures
like
a
man
on
the
eve
of
his
eternal
exile
a
man
departing
to
return
no
more
for
so
many
days
now
these
natural
wonders
and
artistic
masterworks
had
been
central
to
my
life
and
i
was
about
to
leave
them
behind
forever
i
wanted
to
plunge
my
eyes
through
the
lounge
window
and
into
these
atlantic
waters
but
the
panels
were
hermetically
sealed
and
a
mantle
of
sheet
iron
separated
me
from
this
ocean
with
which
i
was
still
unfamiliar
crossing
through
the
lounge
i
arrived
at
the
door
contrived
in
one
of
the
canted
corners
that
opened
into
the
captains
stateroom
much
to
my
astonishment
this
door
was
ajar
i
instinctively
recoiled
if
captain
nemo
was
in
his
stateroom
he
might
see
me
but
not
hearing
any
sounds
i
approached
the
stateroom
was
deserted
i
pushed
the
door
open
i
took
a
few
steps
inside
still
the
same
austere
monastic
appearance
just
then
my
eye
was
caught
by
some
etchings
hanging
on
the
wall
which
i
hadnt
noticed
during
my
first
visit
they
were
portraits
of
great
men
of
history
who
had
spent
their
lives
in
perpetual
devotion
to
a
great
human
ideal
thaddeus
kosciusko
the
hero
whose
dying
words
had
been
finis
poloniae
markos
botzaris
for
modern
greece
the
reincarnation
of
spartas
king
leonidas
daniel
oconnell
irelands
defender
george
washington
founder
of
the
american
union
daniele
manin
the
italian
patriot
abraham
lincoln
dead
from
the
bullet
of
a
believer
in
slavery
and
finally
that
martyr
for
the
redemption
of
the
black
race
john
brown
hanging
from
his
gallows
as
victor
hugos
pencil
has
so
terrifyingly
depicted
latin
save
polands
borders
ed
what
was
the
bond
between
these
heroic
souls
and
the
soul
of
captain
nemo
from
this
collection
of
portraits
could
i
finally
unravel
the
mystery
of
his
existence
was
he
a
fighter
for
oppressed
peoples
a
liberator
of
enslaved
races
had
he
figured
in
the
recent
political
or
social
upheavals
of
this
century
was
he
a
hero
of
that
dreadful
civil
war
in
america
a
war
lamentable
yet
forever
glorious




suddenly
the
clock
struck
eight
the
first
stroke
of
its
hammer
on
the
chime
snapped
me
out
of
my
musings
i
shuddered
as
if
some
invisible
eye
had
plunged
into
my
innermost
thoughts
and
i
rushed
outside
the
stateroom
there
my
eyes
fell
on
the
compass
our
heading
was
still
northerly
the
log
indicated
a
moderate
speed
the
pressure
gauge
a
depth
of
about
sixty
feet
so
circumstances
were
in
favor
of
the
canadians
plans
i
stayed
in
my
stateroom
i
dressed
warmly
fishing
boots
otter
cap
coat
of
fanmussel
fabric
lined
with
sealskin
i
was
ready
i
was
waiting
only
the
propellers
vibrations
disturbed
the
deep
silence
reigning
on
board
i
cocked
an
ear
and
listened
would
a
sudden
outburst
of
voices
tell
me
that
ned
lands
escape
plans
had
just
been
detected
a
ghastly
uneasiness
stole
through
me
i
tried
in
vain
to
recover
my
composure
a
few
minutes
before
nine
oclock
i
glued
my
ear
to
the
captains
door
not
a
sound
i
left
my
stateroom
and
returned
to
the
lounge
which
was
deserted
and
plunged
in
near
darkness
i
opened
the
door
leading
to
the
library
the
same
inadequate
light
the
same
solitude
i
went
to
man
my
post
near
the
door
opening
into
the
well
of
the
central
companionway
i
waited
for
ned
lands
signal
at
this
point
the
propellers
vibrations
slowed
down
appreciably
then
they
died
out
altogether
why
was
the
nautilus
stopping
whether
this
layover
would
help
or
hinder
ned
lands
schemes
i
couldnt
have
said
the
silence
was
further
disturbed
only
by
the
pounding
of
my
heart
suddenly
i
felt
a
mild
jolt
i
realized
the
nautilus
had
come
to
rest
on
the
ocean
floor
my
alarm
increased
the
canadians
signal
hadnt
reached
me
i
longed
to
rejoin
ned
land
and
urge
him
to
postpone
his
attempt
i
sensed
that
we
were
no
longer
navigating
under
normal
conditions
just
then
the
door
to
the
main
lounge
opened
and
captain
nemo
appeared
he
saw
me
and
without
further
preamble
ah
professor
he
said
in
an
affable
tone
ive
been
looking
for
you
do
you
know
your
spanish
history
even
if
he
knew
it
by
heart
a
man
in
my
disturbed
befuddled
condition
couldnt
have
quoted
a
syllable
of
his
own
countrys
history
well
captain
nemo
went
on
did
you
hear
my
question
do
you
know
the
history
of
spain
very
little
of
it
i
replied
the
most
learned
men
the
captain
said
still
have
much
to
learn
have
a
seat
he
added
and
ill
tell
you
about
an
unusual
episode
in
this
body
of
history
the
captain
stretched
out
on
a
couch
and
i
mechanically
took
a
seat
near
him
but
half
in
the
shadows
professor
he
said
listen
carefully
this
piece
of
history
concerns
you
in
one
definite
respect
because
it
will
answer
a
question
youve
no
doubt
been
unable
to
resolve
im
listening
captain
i
said
not
knowing
what
my
partner
in
this
dialogue
was
driving
at
and
wondering
if
this
incident
related
to
our
escape
plans
professor
captain
nemo
went
on
if
youre
amenable
well
go
back
in
time
to
1702
youre
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
those
days
your
king
louis
xiv
thought
an
imperial
gesture
would
suffice
to
humble
the
pyrenees
in
the
dust
so
he
inflicted
his
grandson
the
duke
of
anjou
on
the
spaniards
reigning
more
or
less
poorly
under
the
name
king
philip
v
this
aristocrat
had
to
deal
with
mighty
opponents
abroad
in
essence
the
year
before
the
royal
houses
of
holland
austria
and
england
had
signed
a
treaty
of
alliance
at
the
hague
aiming
to
wrest
the
spanish
crown
from
king
philip
v
and
to
place
it
on
the
head
of
an
archduke
whom
they
prematurely
dubbed
king
charles
iii
spain
had
to
withstand
these
allies
but
the
country
had
practically
no
army
or
navy
yet
it
wasnt
short
of
money
provided
that
its
galleons
laden
with
gold
and
silver
from
america
could
enter
its
ports
now
then
late
in
1702
spain
was
expecting
a
rich
convoy
which
france
ventured
to
escort
with
a
fleet
of
twentythree
vessels
under
the
command
of
admiral
de
chateaurenault
because
by
that
time
the
allied
navies
were
roving
the
atlantic
this
convoy
was
supposed
to
put
into
cadiz
but
after
learning
that
the
english
fleet
lay
across
those
waterways
the
admiral
decided
to
make
for
a
french
port
the
spanish
commanders
in
the
convoy
objected
to
this
decision
they
wanted
to
be
taken
to
a
spanish
port
if
not
to
cadiz
then
to
the
bay
of
vigo
located
on
spains
northwest
coast
and
not
blockaded
admiral
de
chateaurenault
was
so
indecisive
as
to
obey
this
directive
and
the
galleons
entered
the
bay
of
vigo
unfortunately
this
bay
forms
an
open
offshore
mooring
thats
impossible
to
defend
so
it
was
essential
to
hurry
and
empty
the
galleons
before
the
allied
fleets
arrived
and
there
would
have
been
ample
time
for
this
unloading
if
a
wretched
question
of
trade
agreements
hadnt
suddenly
come
up
are
you
clear
on
the
chain
of
events
captain
nemo
asked
me
perfectly
clear
i
said
not
yet
knowing
why
i
was
being
given
this
history
lesson
then
ill
continue
heres
what
came
to
pass
the
tradesmen
of
cadiz
had
negotiated
a
charter
whereby
they
were
to
receive
all
merchandise
coming
from
the
west
indies
now
then
unloading
the
ingots
from
those
galleons
at
the
port
of
vigo
would
have
been
a
violation
of
their
rights
so
they
lodged
a
complaint
in
madrid
and
they
obtained
an
order
from
the
indecisive
king
philip
v
without
unloading
the
convoy
would
stay
in
custody
at
the
offshore
mooring
of
vigo
until
the
enemy
fleets
had
retreated
now
then
just
as
this
decision
was
being
handed
down
english
vessels
arrived
in
the
bay
of
vigo
on
october
22
1702
despite
his
inferior
forces
admiral
de
chateaurenault
fought
courageously
but
when
he
saw
that
the
convoys
wealth
was
about
to
fall
into
enemy
hands
he
burned
and
scuttled
the
galleons
which
went
to
the
bottom
with
their
immense
treasures
captain
nemo
stopped
i
admit
it
i
still
couldnt
see
how
this
piece
of
history
concerned
me
well
i
asked
him
well
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
answered
me
were
actually
in
that
bay
of
vigo
and
all
thats
left
is
for
you
to
probe
the
mysteries
of
the
place
the
captain
stood
up
and
invited
me
to
follow
him
id
had
time
to
collect
myself
i
did
so
the
lounge
was
dark
but
the
seas
waves
sparkled
through
the
transparent
windows
i
stared
around
the
nautilus
for
a
halfmile
radius
the
waters
seemed
saturated
with
electric
light
the
sandy
bottom
was
clear
and
bright
dressed
in
diving
suits
crewmen
were
busy
clearing
away
halfrotted
barrels
and
disemboweled
trunks
in
the
midst
of
the
dingy
hulks
of
ships
out
of
these
trunks
and
kegs
spilled
ingots
of
gold
and
silver
cascades
of
jewels
pieces
of
eight
the
sand
was
heaped
with
them
then
laden
with
these
valuable
spoils
the
men
returned
to
the
nautilus
dropped
off
their
burdens
inside
and
went
to
resume
this
inexhaustible
fishing
for
silver
and
gold
i
understood
this
was
the
setting
of
that
battle
on
october
22
1702
here
in
this
very
place
those
galleons
carrying
treasure
to
the
spanish
government
had
gone
to
the
bottom
here
whenever
he
needed
captain
nemo
came
to
withdraw
these
millions
to
ballast
his
nautilus
it
was
for
him
for
him
alone
that
america
had
yielded
up
its
precious
metals
he
was
the
direct
sole
heir
to
these
treasures
wrested
from
the
incas
and
those
peoples
conquered
by
hernando
cortez
did
you
know
professor
he
asked
me
with
a
smile
that
the
sea
contained
such
wealth
i
know
its
estimated
i
replied
that
there
are
2000000
metric
tons
of
silver
held
in
suspension
in
seawater
surely
but
in
extracting
that
silver
your
expenses
would
outweigh
your
profits
here
by
contrast
i
have
only
to
pick
up
what
other
men
have
lost
and
not
only
in
this
bay
of
vigo
but
at
a
thousand
other
sites
where
ships
have
gone
down
whose
positions
are
marked
on
my
underwater
chart
do
you
understand
now
that
im
rich
to
the
tune
of
billions
i
understand
captain
nevertheless
allow
me
to
inform
you
that
by
harvesting
this
very
bay
of
vigo
youre
simply
forestalling
the
efforts
of
a
rival
organization
what
organization
a
company
chartered
by
the
spanish
government
to
search
for
these
sunken
galleons
the
companys
investors
were
lured
by
the
bait
of
enormous
gains
because
this
scuttled
treasure
is
estimated
to
be
worth
500000000
francs
it
was
500000000
francs
captain
nemo
replied
but
no
more
right
i
said
hence
a
timely
warning
to
those
investors
would
be
an
act
of
charity
yet
who
knows
if
it
would
be
well
received
usually
what
gamblers
regret
the
most
isnt
the
loss
of
their
money
so
much
as
the
loss
of
their
insane
hopes
but
ultimately
i
feel
less
sorry
for
them
than
for
the
thousands
of
unfortunate
people
who
would
have
benefited
from
a
fair
distribution
of
this
wealth
whereas
now
it
will
be
of
no
help
to
them
no
sooner
had
i
voiced
this
regret
than
i
felt
it
must
have
wounded
captain
nemo
no
help
he
replied
with
growing
animation
sir
what
makes
you
assume
this
wealth
goes
to
waste
when
im
the
one
amassing
it
do
you
think
i
toil
to
gather
this
treasure
out
of
selfishness
who
says
i
dont
put
it
to
good
use
do
you
think
im
unaware
of
the
suffering
beings
and
oppressed
races
living
on
this
earth
poor
people
to
comfort
victims
to
avenge
dont
you
understand




captain
nemo
stopped
on
these
last
words
perhaps
sorry
that
he
had
said
too
much
but
i
had
guessed
whatever
motives
had
driven
him
to
seek
independence
under
the
seas
he
remained
a
human
being
before
all
else
his
heart
still
throbbed
for
suffering
humanity
and
his
immense
philanthropy
went
out
both
to
downtrodden
races
and
to
individuals
and
now
i
knew
where
captain
nemo
had
delivered
those
millions
when
the
nautilus
navigated
the
waters
where
crete
was
in
rebellion
against
the
ottoman
empire
chapter
9
a
lost
continent
the
next
morning
february
19
i
beheld
the
canadian
entering
my
stateroom
i
was
expecting
this
visit
he
wore
an
expression
of
great
disappointment
well
sir
he
said
to
me
well
ned
the
fates
were
against
us
yesterday
yes
that
damned
captain
had
to
call
a
halt
just
as
we
were
going
to
escape
from
his
boat
yes
ned
he
had
business
with
his
bankers
his
bankers
or
rather
his
bank
vaults
by
which
i
mean
this
ocean
where
his
wealth
is
safer
than
in
any
national
treasury
i
then
related
the
evenings
incidents
to
the
canadian
secretly
hoping
he
would
come
around
to
the
idea
of
not
deserting
the
captain
but
my
narrative
had
no
result
other
than
neds
voicing
deep
regret
that
he
hadnt
strolled
across
the
vigo
battlefield
on
his
own
behalf
anyhow
he
said
its
not
over
yet
my
first
harpoon
missed
thats
all
well
succeed
the
next
time
and
as
soon
as
this
evening
if
need
be



whats
the
nautiluss
heading
i
asked
ive
no
idea
ned
replied
all
right
at
noon
well
find
out
what
our
position
is
the
canadian
returned
to
conseils
side
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
i
went
into
the
lounge
the
compass
wasnt
encouraging
the
nautiluss
course
was
southsouthwest
we
were
turning
our
backs
on
europe
i
could
hardly
wait
until
our
position
was
reported
on
the
chart
near
1130
the
ballast
tanks
emptied
and
the
submersible
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
i
leaped
onto
the
platform
ned
land
was
already
there
no
more
shore
in
sight
nothing
but
the
immenseness
of
the
sea
a
few
sails
were
on
the
horizon
no
doubt
ships
going
as
far
as
cape
so
roque
to
find
favorable
winds
for
doubling
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
sky
was
overcast
a
squall
was
on
the
way
furious
ned
tried
to
see
through
the
mists
on
the
horizon
he
still
hoped
that
behind
all
that
fog
there
lay
those
shores
he
longed
for
at
noon
the
sun
made
a
momentary
appearance
taking
advantage
of
this
rift
in
the
clouds
the
chief
officer
took
the
orbs
altitude
then
the
sea
grew
turbulent
we
went
below
again
and
the
hatch
closed
once
more
when
i
consulted
the
chart
an
hour
later
i
saw
that
the
nautiluss
position
was
marked
at
longitude
16
degrees
17
and
latitude
33
degrees
22
a
good
150
leagues
from
the
nearest
coast
it
wouldnt
do
to
even
dream
of
escaping
and
ill
let
the
reader
decide
how
promptly
the
canadian
threw
a
tantrum
when
i
ventured
to
tell
him
our
situation
as
for
me
i
wasnt
exactly
griefstricken
i
felt
as
if
a
heavy
weight
had
been
lifted
from
me
and
i
was
able
to
resume
my
regular
tasks
in
a
state
of
comparative
calm
near
eleven
oclock
in
the
evening
i
received
a
most
unexpected
visit
from
captain
nemo
he
asked
me
very
graciously
if
i
felt
exhausted
from
our
vigil
the
night
before
i
said
no
then
professor
aronnax
i
propose
an
unusual
excursion
propose
away
captain
so
far
youve
visited
the
ocean
depths
only
by
day
and
under
sunlight
would
you
like
to
see
these
depths
on
a
dark
night
very
much
i
warn
you
this
will
be
an
exhausting
stroll
well
need
to
walk
long
hours
and
scale
a
mountain
the
roads
arent
terribly
well
kept
up
everything
you
say
captain
just
increases
my
curiosity
im
ready
to
go
with
you
then
come
along
professor
and
well
go
put
on
our
diving
suits
arriving
at
the
wardrobe
i
saw
that
neither
my
companions
nor
any
crewmen
would
be
coming
with
us
on
this
excursion
captain
nemo
hadnt
even
suggested
my
fetching
ned
or
conseil
in
a
few
moments
we
had
put
on
our
equipment
air
tanks
abundantly
charged
were
placed
on
our
backs
but
the
electric
lamps
were
not
in
readiness
i
commented
on
this
to
the
captain
theyll
be
useless
to
us
he
replied
i
thought
i
hadnt
heard
him
right
but
i
couldnt
repeat
my
comment
because
the
captains
head
had
already
disappeared
into
its
metal
covering
i
finished
harnessing
myself
i
felt
an
alpenstock
being
placed
in
my
hand
and
a
few
minutes
later
after
the
usual
procedures
we
set
foot
on
the
floor
of
the
atlantic
300
meters
down
midnight
was
approaching
the
waters
were
profoundly
dark
but
captain
nemo
pointed
to
a
reddish
spot
in
the
distance
a
sort
of
wide
glow
shimmering
about
two
miles
from
the
nautilus
what
this
fire
was
what
substances
fed
it
how
and
why
it
kept
burning
in
the
liquid
mass
i
couldnt
say
anyhow
it
lit
our
way
although
hazily
but
i
soon
grew
accustomed
to
this
unique
gloom
and
in
these
circumstances
i
understood
the
uselessness
of
the
ruhmkorff
device
side
by
side
captain
nemo
and
i
walked
directly
toward
this
conspicuous
flame
the
level
seafloor
rose
imperceptibly
we
took
long
strides
helped
by
our
alpenstocks
but
in
general
our
progress
was
slow
because
our
feet
kept
sinking
into
a
kind
of
slimy
mud
mixed
with
seaweed
and
assorted
flat
stones
as
we
moved
forward
i
heard
a
kind
of
pitterpatter
above
my
head
sometimes
this
noise
increased
and
became
a
continuous
crackle
i
soon
realized
the
cause
it
was
a
heavy
rainfall
rattling
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
instinctively
i
worried
that
i
might
get
soaked
by
water
in
the
midst
of
water
i
couldnt
help
smiling
at
this
outlandish
notion
but
to
tell
the
truth
wearing
these
heavy
diving
suits
you
no
longer
feel
the
liquid
element
you
simply
think
youre
in
the
midst
of
air
a
little
denser
than
air
on
land
thats
all
after
half
an
hour
of
walking
the
seafloor
grew
rocky
jellyfish
microscopic
crustaceans
and
seapen
coral
lit
it
faintly
with
their
phosphorescent
glimmers
i
glimpsed
piles
of
stones
covered
by
a
couple
million
zoophytes
and
tangles
of
algae
my
feet
often
slipped
on
this
viscous
seaweed
carpet
and
without
my
alpenstock
i
would
have
fallen
more
than
once
when
i
turned
around
i
could
still
see
the
nautiluss
whitish
beacon
which
was
starting
to
grow
pale
in
the
distance
those
piles
of
stones
just
mentioned
were
laid
out
on
the
ocean
floor
with
a
distinct
but
inexplicable
symmetry
i
spotted
gigantic
furrows
trailing
off
into
the
distant
darkness
their
length
incalculable
there
also
were
other
peculiarities
i
couldnt
make
sense
of
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
heavy
lead
soles
were
crushing
a
litter
of
bones
that
made
a
dry
crackling
noise
so
what
were
these
vast
plains
we
were
now
crossing
i
wanted
to
ask
the
captain
but
i
still
didnt
grasp
that
sign
language
that
allowed
him
to
chat
with
his
companions
when
they
went
with
him
on
his
underwater
excursions
meanwhile
the
reddish
light
guiding
us
had
expanded
and
inflamed
the
horizon
the
presence
of
this
furnace
under
the
waters
had
me
extremely
puzzled
was
it
some
sort
of
electrical
discharge
was
i
approaching
some
natural
phenomenon
still
unknown
to
scientists
on
shore
or
rather
and
this
thought
did
cross
my
mind
had
the
hand
of
man
intervened
in
that
blaze
had
human
beings
fanned
those
flames
in
these
deep
strata
would
i
meet
up
with
more
of
captain
nemos
companions
friends
he
was
about
to
visit
who
led
lives
as
strange
as
his
own
would
i
find
a
whole
colony
of
exiles
down
here
men
tired
of
the
worlds
woes
men
who
had
sought
and
found
independence
in
the
oceans
lower
depths
all
these
insane
inadmissible
ideas
dogged
me
and
in
this
frame
of
mind
continually
excited
by
the
series
of
wonders
passing
before
my
eyes
i
wouldnt
have
been
surprised
to
find
on
this
sea
bottom
one
of
those
underwater
towns
captain
nemo
dreamed
about
our
path
was
getting
brighter
and
brighter
the
red
glow
had
turned
white
and
was
radiating
from
a
mountain
peak
about
800
feet
high
but
what
i
saw
was
simply
a
reflection
produced
by
the
crystal
waters
of
these
strata
the
furnace
that
was
the
source
of
this
inexplicable
light
occupied
the
far
side
of
the
mountain
in
the
midst
of
the
stone
mazes
furrowing
this
atlantic
seafloor
captain
nemo
moved
forward
without
hesitation
he
knew
this
dark
path
no
doubt
he
had
often
traveled
it
and
was
incapable
of
losing
his
way
i
followed
him
with
unshakeable
confidence
he
seemed
like
some
spirit
of
the
sea
and
as
he
walked
ahead
of
me
i
marveled
at
his
tall
figure
which
stood
out
in
black
against
the
glowing
background
of
the
horizon
it
was
one
oclock
in
the
morning
we
arrived
at
the
mountains
lower
gradients
but
in
grappling
with
them
we
had
to
venture
up
difficult
trails
through
a
huge
thicket
yes
a
thicket
of
dead
trees
trees
without
leaves
without
sap
turned
to
stone
by
the
action
of
the
waters
and
crowned
here
and
there
by
gigantic
pines
it
was
like
a
stillerect
coalfield
its
roots
clutching
broken
soil
its
boughs
clearly
outlined
against
the
ceiling
of
the
waters
like
thin
black
paper
cutouts
picture
a
forest
clinging
to
the
sides
of
a
peak
in
the
harz
mountains
but
a
submerged
forest
the
trails
were
cluttered
with
algae
and
fucus
plants
hosts
of
crustaceans
swarming
among
them
i
plunged
on
scaling
rocks
straddling
fallen
tree
trunks
snapping
marine
creepers
that
swayed
from
one
tree
to
another
startling
the
fish
that
flitted
from
branch
to
branch
carried
away
i
didnt
feel
exhausted
any
more
i
followed
a
guide
who
was
immune
to
exhaustion
what
a
sight
how
can
i
describe
it
how
can
i
portray
these
woods
and
rocks
in
this
liquid
setting
their
lower
parts
dark
and
sullen
their
upper
parts
tinted
red
in
this
light
whose
intensity
was
doubled
by
the
reflecting
power
of
the
waters
we
scaled
rocks
that
crumbled
behind
us
collapsing
in
enormous
sections
with
the
hollow
rumble
of
an
avalanche
to
our
right
and
left
there
were
carved
gloomy
galleries
where
the
eye
lost
its
way
huge
glades
opened
up
seemingly
cleared
by
the
hand
of
man
and
i
sometimes
wondered
whether
some
residents
of
these
underwater
regions
would
suddenly
appear
before
me
but
captain
nemo
kept
climbing
i
didnt
want
to
fall
behind
i
followed
him
boldly
my
alpenstock
was
a
great
help
one
wrong
step
would
have
been
disastrous
on
the
narrow
paths
cut
into
the
sides
of
these
chasms
but
i
walked
along
with
a
firm
tread
and
without
the
slightest
feeling
of
dizziness
sometimes
i
leaped
over
a
crevasse
whose
depth
would
have
made
me
recoil
had
i
been
in
the
midst
of
glaciers
on
shore
sometimes
i
ventured
out
on
a
wobbling
tree
trunk
fallen
across
a
gorge
without
looking
down
having
eyes
only
for
marveling
at
the
wild
scenery
of
this
region
there
leaning
on
erratically
cut
foundations
monumental
rocks
seemed
to
defy
the
laws
of
balance
from
between
their
stony
knees
trees
sprang
up
like
jets
under
fearsome
pressure
supporting
other
trees
that
supported
them
in
turn
next
natural
towers
with
wide
steeply
carved
battlements
leaned
at
angles
that
on
dry
land
the
laws
of
gravity
would
never
have
authorized
and
i
too
could
feel
the
difference
created
by
the
waters
powerful
densitydespite
my
heavy
clothing
copper
headpiece
and
metal
soles
i
climbed
the
most
impossibly
steep
gradients
with
all
the
nimbleness
i
swear
it
of
a
chamois
or
a
pyrenees
mountain
goat
as
for
my
account
of
this
excursion
under
the
waters
im
well
aware
that
it
sounds
incredible
im
the
chronicler
of
deeds
seemingly
impossible
and
yet
incontestably
real
this
was
no
fantasy
this
was
what
i
saw
and
felt
two
hours
after
leaving
the
nautilus
we
had
cleared
the
timberline
and
100
feet
above
our
heads
stood
the
mountain
peak
forming
a
dark
silhouette
against
the
brilliant
glare
that
came
from
its
far
slope
petrified
shrubs
rambled
here
and
there
in
sprawling
zigzags
fish
rose
in
a
body
at
our
feet
like
birds
startled
in
tall
grass
the
rocky
mass
was
gouged
with
impenetrable
crevices
deep
caves
unfathomable
holes
at
whose
far
ends
i
could
hear
fearsome
things
moving
around
my
blood
would
curdle
as
i
watched
some
enormous
antenna
bar
my
path
or
saw
some
frightful
pincer
snap
shut
in
the
shadow
of
some
cavity
a
thousand
specks
of
light
glittered
in
the
midst
of
the
gloom
they
were
the
eyes
of
gigantic
crustaceans
crouching
in
their
lairs
giant
lobsters
rearing
up
like
spear
carriers
and
moving
their
claws
with
a
scrapiron
clanking
titanic
crabs
aiming
their
bodies
like
cannons
on
their
carriages
and
hideous
devilfish
intertwining
their
tentacles
like
bushes
of
writhing
snakes
what
was
this
astounding
world
that
i
didnt
yet
know
in
what
order
did
these
articulates
belong
these
creatures
for
which
the
rocks
provided
a
second
carapace
where
had
nature
learned
the
secret
of
their
vegetating
existence
and
for
how
many
centuries
had
they
lived
in
the
oceans
lower
strata
but
i
couldnt
linger
captain
nemo
on
familiar
terms
with
these
dreadful
animals
no
longer
minded
them
we
arrived
at
a
preliminary
plateau
where
still
other
surprises
were
waiting
for
me
there
picturesque
ruins
took
shape
betraying
the
hand
of
man
not
our
creator
they
were
huge
stacks
of
stones
in
which
you
could
distinguish
the
indistinct
forms
of
palaces
and
temples
now
arrayed
in
hosts
of
blossoming
zoophytes
and
over
it
all
not
ivy
but
a
heavy
mantle
of
algae
and
fucus
plants
but
what
part
of
the
globe
could
this
be
this
land
swallowed
by
cataclysms
who
had
set
up
these
rocks
and
stones
like
the
dolmens
of
prehistoric
times
where
was
i
where
had
captain
nemos
fancies
taken
me
i
wanted
to
ask
him
unable
to
i
stopped
him
i
seized
his
arm
but
he
shook
his
head
pointed
to
the
mountains
topmost
peak
and
seemed
to
tell
me
come
on
come
with
me
come
higher
i
followed
him
with
one
last
burst
of
energy
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
had
scaled
the
peak
which
crowned
the
whole
rocky
mass
by
some
ten
meters
i
looked
back
down
the
side
we
had
just
cleared
there
the
mountain
rose
only
700
to
800
feet
above
the
plains
but
on
its
far
slope
it
crowned
the
receding
bottom
of
this
part
of
the
atlantic
by
a
height
twice
that
my
eyes
scanned
the
distance
and
took
in
a
vast
area
lit
by
intense
flashes
of
light
in
essence
this
mountain
was
a
volcano
fifty
feet
below
its
peak
amid
a
shower
of
stones
and
slag
a
wide
crater
vomited
torrents
of
lava
that
were
dispersed
in
fiery
cascades
into
the
heart
of
the
liquid
mass
so
situated
this
volcano
was
an
immense
torch
that
lit
up
the
lower
plains
all
the
way
to
the
horizon
as
i
said
this
underwater
crater
spewed
lava
but
not
flames
flames
need
oxygen
from
the
air
and
are
unable
to
spread
underwater
but
a
lava
flow
which
contains
in
itself
the
principle
of
its
incandescence
can
rise
to
a

in

there
beneath

was
a

in

demolished

laid

in

down

its

you
could
still
detect
the
solid
proportions
of
a
sort
of
tuscan
architecture
farther
off
the
remains
of
a
gigantic
aqueduct
here
the
caked
heights
of
an
acropolis
along
with
the
fluid
forms
of
a
parthenon
there
the
remnants
of
a

as
if
some
bygone

long

harbored

came
over
and
stopped
me
with
a
gesture
then
picking
up
a
piece
of
chalky
stone
he
advanced
to
a

scrawled

atlantis
that
ancient
land
of

the

as

who
entered
its

the

under

furnishing
its
own
unimpeachable
evidence
of
the
catastrophe
that
had
overtaken
it

this
was
the

existed
outside

with

in
the

already
8000
years
of

documented
by
the
annals
engraved
on
the
sacred
walls
of
its
temples
one
of
these
elders
related
the
history
of
another
town
1000
years
older
still
this
original
city
of
athens
ninety
centuries

had
been
invaded
and

destroyed
by

they

to

they
had
to
retreat

centuries
passed
a
cataclysm

earthquakes
a
single
night

were

madeira
the
azores
the
canaries
the
cape

still
emerge
above
the

these
were
the
historical
memories
that
captain
nemos
scrawl
sent
rushing
through
my
mind
thus
led
by
the
strangest
of
fates
i
was
treading
underfoot
one
of
the
mountains
of
that
continent
my
hands
were
touching
ruins
many
thousands
of
years
old
contemporary
with
prehistoric
times
i
was
walking
in
the
very
place
where
contemporaries
of
early
man
had
walked
my
heavy
soles
were
crushing
the
skeletons
of
animals
from
the
age
of
fable
animals
that
used
to
take
cover
in
the
shade
of
these
trees
now
turned
to
stone
oh
why
was
i
so
short
of
time
i
would
have
gone
down
the
steep
slopes
of
this
mountain
crossed
this
entire
immense
continent
which
surely
connects
africa
with
america
and
visited
its
great
prehistoric
cities
under
my
eyes
there
perhaps
lay
the
warlike
town
of
makhimos
or
the
pious
village
of
eusebes
whose
gigantic
inhabitants
lived
for
whole
centuries
and
had
the
strength
to
raise
blocks
of
stone
that
still
withstood
the
action
of
the
waters
one
day
perhaps
some
volcanic
phenomenon
will
bring
these
sunken
ruins
back
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
numerous
underwater
volcanoes
have
been
sighted
in
this
part
of
the
ocean
and
many
ships
have
felt
terrific
tremors
when
passing
over
these
turbulent
depths
a
few
have
heard
hollow
noises
that
announced
some
struggle
of
the
elements
far
below
others
have
hauled
in
volcanic
ash
hurled
above
the
waves
as
far
as
the
equator
this
whole
seafloor
is
still
under
construction
by
plutonic
forces
and
in
some
remote
epoch
built
up
by
volcanic
disgorgings
and
successive
layers
of
lava
who
knows
whether
the
peaks
of
these
firebelching
mountains
may
reappear
above
the
surface
of
the
atlantic
as
i
mused
in
this
way
trying
to
establish
in
my
memory
every
detail
of
this
impressive
landscape
captain
nemo
was
leaning
his
elbows
on
a
mosscovered
monument
motionless
as
if
petrified
in
some
mute
trance
was
he
dreaming
of
those
lost
generations
asking
them
for
the
secret
of
human
destiny
was
it
here
that
this
strange
man
came
to
revive
himself
basking
in
historical
memories
reliving
that
bygone
life
he
who
had
no
desire
for
our
modern
one
i
would
have
given
anything
to
know
his
thoughts
to
share
them
understand
them
we
stayed
in
this
place
an
entire
hour
contemplating
its
vast
plains
in
the
lavas
glow
which
sometimes
took
on
a
startling
intensity
inner
boilings
sent
quick
shivers
running
through
the
mountains
crust
noises
from
deep
underneath
clearly
transmitted
by
the
liquid
medium
reverberated
with
majestic
amplitude
just
then
the
moon
appeared
for
an
instant
through
the
watery
mass
casting
a
few
pale
rays
over
this
submerged
continent
it
was
only
a
fleeting
glimmer
but
its
effect
was
indescribable
the
captain
stood
up
and
took
one
last
look
at
these
immense
plains
then
his
hand
signaled
me
to
follow
him
we
went
swiftly
down
the
mountain
once
past
the
petrified
forest
i
could
see
the
nautiluss
beacon
twinkling
like
a
star
the
captain
walked
straight
toward
it
and
we
were
back
on
board
just
as
the
first
glimmers
of
dawn
were
whitening
the
surface
of
the
ocean

exhausted
from
the
night

i
didnt

up
until
eleven
oclock
i

and

meters
conseil
entered
i
described
our
nocturnal
excursion
to
him
and
since
the
panels
were
open
he
could
still
catch
a
glimpse
of
this
submerged
continent
in
fact
the
nautilus
was
skimming
only
ten
meters
over
the
soil
of
these
atlantis
plains
the
ship
scudded
along
like
an
air
balloon
borne
by
the
wind
over
some
prairie
on
land
but
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
we
sat
in
the
lounge
as
if
we
were
riding
in
a
coach
on
an
express
train
as
for
the
foregrounds
passing
before
our
eyes
they
were
fantastically
carved
rocks
forests
of
trees
that
had
crossed
over
from
the
vegetable
kingdom
into
the
mineral
kingdom
their
motionless
silhouettes
sprawling
beneath
the
waves
there
also
were
stony
masses
buried
beneath
carpets
of
axidia
and
sea
anemone
bristling
with
long
vertical
water
plants
then
strangely
contoured
blocks
of
lava
that
testified
to
all
the
fury
of
those
plutonic
developments
while
this
bizarre
scenery
was
glittering
under
our
electric
beams
i
told
conseil
the
story
of
the
atlanteans
who
had
inspired
the
old
french
scientist
jean
bailly
to
write
so
many
entertainingalbeit
utterly
fictitiouspages
i
told
the
lad
about
the
wars
of
these
heroic
people
i
discussed
the
question
of
atlantis
with
the
fervor
of
a
man
who
no
longer
had
any
doubts
but
conseil
was
so
distracted
he
barely
heard
me
and
his
lack
of
interest
in
any
commentary
on
this
historical
topic
was
soon
explained
bailly
believed
that
atlantis
was
located
at
the
north
pole
ed
in
essence
numerous
fish
had
caught
his
eye
and
when
fish
pass
by
conseil
vanishes
into
his
world
of
classifying
and
leaves
real
life
behind
in
which
case
i
could
only
tag
along
and
resume
our
ichthyological
research
even
so
these
atlantic
fish
were
not
noticeably
different
from
those
we
had
observed
earlier
there
were
rays
of

and
with

from

like

but
while
observing
these
different
specimens
of
marine
fauna
i
didnt
stop
examining
the
long
plains
of
atlantis
sometimes
an
unpredictable
irregularity
in
the
seafloor
would
force
the
nautilus
to
slow
down
and
then
it
would
glide
into
the
narrow
channels
between
the
hills
with
a
cetaceans
dexterity
if
the
labyrinth
became
hopelessly
tangled
the
submersible
would
rise
above
it
like
an
airship
and
after
clearing
the
obstacle
it
would
resume
its
speedy
course
just
a
few
meters
above
the
ocean
floor
it
was
an
enjoyable
and
impressive
way
of
navigating
that
did
indeed
recall
the
maneuvers
of
an
airship
ride
with
the
major
difference
that
the
nautilus
faithfully
obeyed
the
hands
of
its
helmsman
the
terrain
consisted
mostly
of
thick
slime
mixed
with
petrified
branches
but
it
changed
little
by
little
near
four
oclock
in
the
afternoon
it
grew
rockier
and
seemed
to
be
strewn
with
pudding
stones
and
a
basaltic
gravel
called
tuff
together
with
bits
of
lava
and
sulfurous
obsidian
i
expected
these
long
plains
to
change
into
mountain
regions
and
in
fact
as
the
nautilus
was
executing
certain
turns
i
noticed
that
the
southerly
horizon
was
blocked
by
a
high
wall
that
seemed
to
close
off
every
exit
its
summit
obviously
poked
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
it
had
to
be
a
continent
or
at
least
an
island
either
one
of
the
canaries
or
one
of
the
cape
verde
islands
our
bearings
hadnt
been
marked
on
the
chartperhaps
deliberatelyand
i
had
no
idea
what
our
position
was
in
any
case
this
wall
seemed
to
signal
the
end
of
atlantis
of
which
all
in
all
we
had
crossed
only
a
small
part
nightfall
didnt
interrupt
my
observations
i
was
left
to
myself
conseil
had
repaired
to
his
cabin
the
nautilus
slowed
down
hovering
above
the
muddled
masses
on
the
seafloor
sometimes
grazing
them
as
if
wanting
to
come
to
rest
sometimes
rising
unpredictably
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
then
i
glimpsed
a
few
bright
constellations
through
the
crystal
waters
specifically
five
or
six
of
those
zodiacal
stars
trailing
from
the
tail
end
of
orion
i
would
have
stayed
longer
at
my
window
marveling
at
these
beauties
of
sea
and
sky
but
the
panels
closed
just
then
the
nautilus
had
arrived
at
the
perpendicular
face
of
that
high
wall
how
the
ship
would
maneuver
i
hadnt
a
guess
i
repaired
to
my
stateroom
the
nautilus
did
not
stir
i
fell
asleep
with
the
firm
intention
of
waking
up
in
just
a
few
hours
but
it
was
eight
oclock
the
next
day
when
i
returned
to
the
lounge
i
stared
at
the
pressure
gauge
it
told
me
that
the
nautilus
was
afloat
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
furthermore
i
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
platform
yet
there
were
no
rolling
movements
to
indicate
the
presence
of
waves
undulating
above
me
i
climbed
as
far
as
the
hatch
it
was
open
but
instead
of
the
broad
daylight
i
was
expecting
i
found
that
i
was
surrounded
by
total
darkness
where
were
we
had
i
been
mistaken
was
it
still
night
no
not
one
star
was
twinkling
and
nighttime
is
never
so
utterly
black
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
when
a
voice
said
to
me
is
that
you
professor
ah
captain
nemo
i
replied
where
are
we
underground
professor
underground
i
exclaimed
and
the
nautilus
is
still
floating
it
always
floats
but
i
dont
understand
wait
a
little
while
our
beacon
is
about
to
go
on
and
if
you
want
some
light
on
the
subject
youll
be
satisfied
i
set
foot
on
the
platform
and
waited
the
darkness
was
so
profound
i
couldnt
see
even
captain
nemo
however
looking
at
the
zenith
directly
overhead
i
thought
i
caught
sight
of
a
feeble
glimmer
a
sort
of
twilight
filtering
through
a
circular
hole
just
then
the
beacon
suddenly
went
on
and
its
intense
brightness
made
that
hazy
light
vanish
this
stream
of
electricity
dazzled
my
eyes
and
after
momentarily
shutting
them
i
looked
around
the
nautilus
was
stationary
it
was
floating
next
to
an
embankment
shaped
like
a
wharf
as
for
the
water
now
buoying
the
ship
it
was
a
lake
completely
encircled
by
an
inner
wall
about
two
miles
in
diameter
hence
six
miles
around
its
levelas
indicated
by
the
pressure
gaugewould
be
the
same
as
the
outside
level
because
some
connection
had
to
exist
between
this
lake
and
the
sea
slanting
inward
over
their
base
these
high
walls
converged
to
form
a
vault
shaped
like
an
immense
upsidedown
funnel
that
measured
500
or
600
meters
in
height
at
its
summit
there
gaped
the
circular
opening
through
which
i
had
detected
that
faint
glimmer
obviously
daylight
before
more
carefully
examining
the
interior
features
of
this
enormous
cavern
and
before
deciding
if
it
was
the
work
of
nature
or
humankind
i
went
over
to
captain
nemo
where
are
we
i
said
in
the
very
heart
of
an
extinct
volcano
the
captain
answered
me
a
volcano
whose
interior
was
invaded
by
the
sea
after
some
convulsion
in
the
earth
while
you
were
sleeping
professor
the
nautilus
entered
this
lagoon
through
a
natural
channel
that
opens
ten
meters
below
the
surface
of
the
ocean
this
is
our
home
port
secure
convenient
secret
and
sheltered
against
winds
from
any
direction
along
the
coasts
of
your
continents
or
islands
show
me
any
offshore
mooring
that
can
equal
this
safe
refuge
for
withstanding
the
fury
of
hurricanes
indeed
i
replied
here
youre
in
perfect
safety
captain
nemo
who
could
reach
you
in
the
heart
of
a
volcano
but
dont
i
see
an
opening
at
its
summit
yes
its
crater
a
crater
formerly
filled
with
lava
steam
and
flames
but
which
now
lets
in
this
lifegiving
air
were
breathing
but
which
volcanic
mountain
is
this
i
asked
its
one
of
the
many
islets
with
which
this
sea
is
strewn
for
ships
a
mere
reef
for
us
an
immense
cavern
i
discovered
it
by
chance
and
chance
served
me
well
but
couldnt
someone
enter
through
the
mouth
of
its
crater
no
more
than
i
could
exit
through
it
you
can
climb
about
100
feet
up
the
inner
base
of
this
mountain
but
then
the
walls
overhang
they
lean
too
far
in
to
be
scaled
i
can
see
captain
that
nature
is
your
obedient
servant
any
time
or
any
place
youre
safe
on
this
lake
and
nobody
else
can
visit
its
waters
but
whats
the
purpose
of
this
refuge
the
nautilus
doesnt
need
a
harbor
no
professor
but
it
needs
electricity
to
run
batteries
to
generate
its
electricity
sodium
to
feed
its
batteries
coal
to
make
its
sodium
and
coalfields
from
which
to
dig
its
coal
now
then
right
at
this
spot
the
sea
covers
entire
forests
that
sank
underwater
in
prehistoric
times
today
turned
to
stone
transformed
into
carbon
fuel
they
offer
me
inexhaustible
coal
mines
so
captain
your
men
practice
the
trade
of
miners
here
precisely
these
mines
extend
under
the
waves
like
the
coalfields
at
newcastle
here
dressed
in
diving
suits
pick
and
mattock
in
hand
my
men
go
out
and
dig
this
carbon
fuel
for
which
i
dont
need
a
single
mine
on
land
when
i
burn
this
combustible
to
produce
sodium
the
smoke
escaping
from
the
mountains
crater
gives
it
the
appearance
of
a
stillactive
volcano
and
will
we
see
your
companions
at
work
no
at
least
not
this
time
because
im
eager
to
continue
our
underwater
tour
of
the
world
accordingly
ill
rest
content
with
drawing
on
my
reserve
stock
of
sodium
well
stay
here
long
enough
to
load
it
on
board
in
other
words
a
single
workday
then
well
resume
our
voyage
so
professor
aronnax
if
youd
like
to
explore
this
cavern
and
circle
its
lagoon
seize
the
day
i
thanked
the
captain
and
went
to
look
for
my
two
companions
who
hadnt
yet
left
their
cabin
i
invited
them
to
follow
me
not
telling
them
where
we
were
they
climbed
onto
the
platform
conseil
whom
nothing
could
startle
saw
it
as
a
perfectly
natural
thing
to
fall
asleep
under
the
waves
and
wake
up
under
a
mountain
but
ned
land
had
no
idea
in
his
head
other
than
to
see
if
this
cavern
offered
some
way
out
after
breakfast
near
ten
oclock
we
went
down
onto
the
embankment
so
here
we
are
back
on
shore
conseil
said
id
hardly
call
this
shore
the
canadian
replied
and
besides
we
arent
on
it
but
under
it
a
sandy
beach
unfolded
before
us
measuring
500
feet
at
its
widest
point
between
the
waters
of
the
lake
and
the
foot
of
the
mountains
walls
via
this
strand
you
could
easily
circle
the
lake
but
the
base
of
these
high
walls
consisted
of
broken
soil
over
which
there
lay
picturesque
piles
of
volcanic
blocks
and
enormous
pumice
stones
all
these
crumbling
masses
were
covered
with
an
enamel
polished
by
the
action
of
underground
fires
and
they
glistened
under
the
stream
of
electric
light
from
our
beacon
stirred
up
by
our
footsteps
the
micarich
dust
on
this
beach
flew
into
the
air
like
a
cloud
of
sparks
the
ground
rose
appreciably
as
it
moved
away
from
the
sand
flats
by
the
waves
and
we
soon
arrived
at
some
long
winding
gradients
genuinely
steep
paths
that
allowed
us
to
climb
little
by
little
but
we
had
to
tread
cautiously
in
the
midst
of
pudding
stones
that
werent
cemented
together
and
our
feet
kept
skidding
on
glassy
trachyte
made
of
feldspar
and
quartz
crystals
the
volcanic
nature
of
this
enormous
pit
was
apparent
all
around
us
i
ventured
to
comment
on
it
to
my
companions
can
you
picture
i
asked
them
what
this
funnel
must
have
been
like
when
it
was
filled
with
boiling
lava
and
the
level
of
that
incandescent
liquid
rose
right
to
the
mountains
mouth
like
cast
iron
up
the
insides
of
a
furnace
i
can
picture
it
perfectly
conseil
replied
but
will
master
tell
me
why
this
huge
smelter
suspended
operations
and
how
it
is
that
an
oven
was
replaced
by
the
tranquil
waters
of
a
lake
in
all
likelihood
conseil
because
some
convulsion
created
an
opening
below
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
opening
that
serves
as
a
passageway
for
the
nautilus
then
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
rushed
inside
the
mountain
there
ensued
a
dreadful
struggle
between
the
elements
of
fire
and
water
a
struggle
ending
in
king
neptunes
favor
but
many
centuries
have
passed
since
then
and
this
submerged
volcano
has
changed
into
a
peaceful
cavern
thats
fine
ned
land
answered
i
accept
the
explanation
but
in
our
personal
interests
im
sorry
this
opening
the
professor
mentions
wasnt
made
above
sea
level
but
ned
my
friend
conseil
answered
if
it
werent
an
underwater
passageway
the
nautilus
couldnt
enter
it
and
i
might
add
mr
land
i
said
that
the
waters
wouldnt
have
rushed
under
the
mountain
and
the
volcano
would
still
be
a
volcano
so
you
have
nothing
to
be
sorry
about
our
climb
continued
the
gradients
got
steeper
and
narrower
sometimes
they
were
cut
across
by
deep
pits
that
had
to
be
cleared
masses
of
overhanging
rock
had
to
be
gotten
around
you
slid
on
your
knees
you
crept
on
your
belly
but
helped
by
the
canadians
strength
and
conseils
dexterity
we
overcame
every
obstacle
at
an
elevation
of
about
thirty
meters
the
nature
of
the
terrain
changed
without
becoming
any
easier
pudding
stones
and
trachyte
gave
way
to
black
basaltic
rock
here
lying
in
slabs
all
swollen
with
blisters
there
shaped
like
actual
prisms
and
arranged
into
a
series
of
columns
that
supported
the
springings
of
this
immense
vault
a
wonderful
sample
of
natural
architecture
then
among
this
basaltic
rock
there
snaked
long
hardened
lava
flows
inlaid
with
veins
of
bituminous
coal
and
in
places
covered
by
wide
carpets
of
sulfur
the
sunshine
coming
through
the
crater
had
grown
stronger
shedding
a
hazy
light
over
all
the
volcanic
waste
forever
buried
in
the
heart
of
this
extinct
mountain
but
when
we
had
ascended
to
an
elevation
of
about
250
feet
we
were
stopped
by
insurmountable
obstacles
the
converging
inside
walls
changed
into
overhangs
and
our
climb
into
a
circular
stroll
at
this
topmost
level
the
vegetable
kingdom
began
to
challenge
the
mineral
kingdom
shrubs
and
even
a
few
trees
emerged
from
crevices
in
the
walls
i
recognized
some
spurges
that
let
their
caustic
purgative
sap
trickle
out
there
were
heliotropes
very
remiss
at
living
up
to
their
sunworshipping
reputations
since
no
sunlight
ever
reached
them
their
clusters
of
flowers
drooped
sadly
their
colors
and
scents
were
faded
here
and
there
chrysanthemums
sprouted
timidly
at
the
feet
of
aloes
with
long
sad
sickly
leaves
but
between
these
lava
flows
i
spotted
little
violets
that
still
gave
off
a
subtle
fragrance
and
i
confess
that
i
inhaled
it
with
delight
the
soul
of
a
flower
is
its
scent
and
those
splendid
water
plants
flowers
of
the
sea
have
no
souls
we
had
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
sturdy
clump
of
dragon
trees
which
were
splitting
the
rocks
with
exertions
of
their
muscular
roots
when
ned
land
exclaimed
oh
sir
a
hive
a
hive
i
answered
with
a
gesture
of
utter
disbelief
yes
a
hive
the
canadian
repeated
with
bees
buzzing
around
i
went
closer
and
was
forced
to
recognize
the
obvious
at
the
mouth
of
a
hole
cut
in
the
trunk
of
a
dragon
tree
there
swarmed
thousands
of
these
ingenious
insects
so
common
to
all
the
canary
islands
where
their
output
is
especially
prized
naturally
enough
the
canadian
wanted
to
lay
in
a
supply
of
honey
and
it
would
have
been
illmannered
of
me
to
say
no
he
mixed
sulfur
with
some
dry
leaves
set
them
on
fire
with
a
spark
from
his
tinderbox
and
proceeded
to
smoke
the
bees
out
little
by
little
the
buzzing
died
down
and
the
disemboweled
hive
yielded
several
pounds
of
sweet
honey
ned
land
stuffed
his
haversack
with
it
when
ive
mixed
this
honey
with
our
breadfruit
batter
he
told
us
ill
be
ready
to
serve
you
a
delectable
piece
of
cake
but
of
course
conseil
put
in
it
will
be
gingerbread
im
all
for
gingerbread
i
said
but
lets
resume
this
fascinating
stroll
at
certain
turns
in
the
trail
we
were
going
along
the
lake
appeared
in
its
full
expanse
the
ships
beacon
lit
up
that
whole
placid
surface
which
experienced
neither
ripples
nor
undulations
the
nautilus
lay
perfectly
still
on
its
platform
and
on
the
embankment
crewmen
were
bustling
around
black
shadows
that
stood
out
clearly
in
the
midst
of
the
luminous
air
just
then
we
went
around
the
highest
ridge
of
these
rocky
foothills
that
supported
the
vault
then
i
saw
that
bees
werent

kingdoms
only
representatives
inside
this
volcano
here
and
in
the
shadows
birds
of
prey
soared
and
whirled
flying
away
from
nests
perched
on
tips
of
rock
there
were
sparrow
hawks
with
white
bellies
and
screeching
kestrels
with
all
the
speed
their
stiltlike
legs
could
muster
fine
fat
bustards
scampered
over
the
slopes
ill
let
the
reader
decide
whether
the
canadians
appetite
was
aroused
by
the
sight
of
this
tasty
game
and
whether
he
regretted
having
no
rifle
in
his
hands
he
tried
to
make
stones
do
the
work
of
bullets
and
after
several
fruitless
attempts
he
managed
to
wound
one
of
these
magnificent
bustards
to
say
he
risked
his
life
twenty
times
in
order
to
capture
this
bird
is
simply
the
unadulterated
truth
but
he
fared
so
well
the
animal
went
into
his
sack
to
join
the
honeycombs
by
then
we
were
forced
to
go
back
down
to
the
beach
because
the
ridge
had
become
impossible
above
us
the
yawning
crater
looked
like
the
wide
mouth
of
a
well
from
where
we
stood
the
sky
was
pretty
easy
to
see
and
i
watched
clouds
race
by
disheveled
by
the
west
wind
letting
tatters
of
mist
trail
over
the
mountains
summit
proof
positive
that
those
clouds
kept
at
a
moderate
altitude
because
this
volcano
didnt
rise
more
than
1800
feet
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
half
an
hour
after
the
canadians
latest
exploits
we
were
back
on
the
inner
beach
there
the
local
flora
was
represented
by
a
wide
carpet
of
samphire
a
small
umbelliferous
plant
that
keeps
quite
nicely
which
also
boasts
the
names
glasswort
saxifrage
and
sea
fennel
conseil
picked
a
couple
bunches
as
for
the
local
fauna
it
included
thousands
of
crustaceans
of
every
type
lobsters
hermit
crabs
prawns
mysid
shrimps
daddy
longlegs
rock
crabs
and
a
prodigious
number
of
seashells
such
as
cowries
murex
snails
and
limpets
in
this
locality
there
gaped
the
mouth
of
a
magnificent
cave
my
companions
and
i
took
great
pleasure
in
stretching
out
on
its
finegrained
sand
fire
had
polished
the
sparkling
enamel
of
its
inner
walls
sprinkled
all
over
with
micarich
dust
ned

tapped
these
walls
and
tried
to
probe
their
thickness
i
couldnt
help
smiling
our
conversation
then
turned
to
his
everlasting
escape
plans
and
without
going
too
far
i
felt
i
could
offer
him
this
hope
captain
nemo
had
gone
down
south
only
to
replenish
his
sodium
supplies
so
i
hoped
he
would
now
hug
the
coasts
of
europe
and
america
which
would
allow
the
canadian
to
try
again
with
a
greater
chance
of
success
we
were
stretched
out
in
this
delightful
cave
for
an
hour
our
conversation
lively
at
the
outset
then
languished
a
definite
drowsiness
overcame
us
since
i
saw
no
good
reason
to
resist
the
call
of
sleep
i
fell
into
a
heavy
doze
i
dreamedone
doesnt
choose

dreamsthat
my
life
had
been
reduced
to
the
vegetating
existence
of
a
simple
mollusk
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
cave
made
up
my

startled

the

what
is
it
i
asked
in
a
sitting
position
the
waters
coming
up
to
us
i
got
back
on
my
feet
like
a
torrent
the
sea
was
rushing
into
our
retreat
and
since
we
definitely
were
not
mollusks
we
had
to
clear
out
in
a
few
seconds
we
were
safe
on
top
of
the
cave
what
happened

asked
some
new
phenomenon
not
quite
my

i
replied
it
was
the
tide
merely
the
tide
which
wellnigh
caught
us
by
surprise
just
as
it
did

the

by

perfectly
natural

the

of

threequarters
of
an
hour
later
we
had
completed
our
circular
stroll
and
were
back
on
board
just
then
the
crewmen
finished
loading
the
sodium
supplies
and
the
nautilus
could
have
departed
immediately
but
captain
nemo
gave
no
orders
would
he
wait
for
nightfall
and
exit
through
his
underwater
passageway
in
secrecy
perhaps
be
that
as
it
may
by
the
next
day
the
nautilus
had
left
its
home
port
and
was
navigating
well
out
from
any
shore

few
meters
beneath

the

we

to
set
aside
any

captain

kept
his

pointing
south
where
was

taking
us
i
was
afraid
to
guess
that
day
the
nautilus
crossed
an
odd
part
of
the
atlantic
ocean
no
one
is
unaware
of
the
existence
of
that
great
warmwater
current
known
by
name
as
the
gulf
stream
after
emerging
from
channels
off
florida
it
heads
toward
spitzbergen
but
before
entering
the
gulf
of
mexico
near
latitude
44
degrees
north
this
current
divides
into
two
arms
its
chief
arm
makes
for
the
shores
of
ireland
and
norway
while
the
second
flexes
southward
at
the
level
of
the
azores
then
it
hits
the
coast
of
africa
sweeps
in
a
long
oval
and
returns
to
the
caribbean

a

of
warm
water
around
a
section
of
cool
tranquil
motionless
ocean
called
the
sargasso
sea
this
is
an
actual
lake
in
the
open
atlantic
and
the
great
currents

take
at
least
three
years
to
circle
it
properly
speaking
the
sargasso
sea
covers
every
submerged
part
of
atlantis
certain
authors
have
even
held
that
the
many
weeds
strewn
over
this
sea
were
torn
loose
from
the
prairies
of
that
ancient
continent
but
its
more
likely
that
these
grasses
algae
and
fucus
plants
were
carried
off
from
the
beaches
of
europe
and
america
then
taken
as
far
as
this
zone
by
the
gulf
stream
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
christopher
columbus
assumed
the
existence
of
a
new
world
when
the
ships
of
that
bold
investigator
arrived
in
the
sargasso
sea
they
had
great
difficulty
navigating
in
the
midst
of
these
weeds
which
much
to
their
crews
dismay
slowed
them
down
to
a
halt
and
they
wasted
three
long
weeks
crossing
this
sector
such
was
the
region
our
nautilus
was
visiting
just
then
a
genuine
prairie
a
tightly
woven
carpet
of
algae
gulfweed
and
bladder
wrack
so
dense
and
compact
a
crafts
stempost
couldnt
tear
through
it
without
difficulty
accordingly
not
wanting
to
entangle
his
propeller
in
this
weedchoked
mass
captain
nemo
stayed
at
a
depth
some
meters
below
the
surface
of
the
waves
the
name
sargasso
comes
from
the
spanish
word
sargazo
meaning
gulfweed
this
gulfweed
the
swimming
gulfweed
or
berry
carrier
is
the
chief
substance
making
up
this
immense
shoal
and
heres
why
these
water
plants
collect
in
this
placid
atlantic
basin
according
to
the
expert
on
the
subject
commander
maury
author
of
the
physical
geography
of
the
sea
the
explanation
he
gives
seems
to
entail
a
set
of
conditions
that
everybody
knows
now
maury
says
if
bits
of
cork
or
chaff
or
any
floating
substance
be
put
into
a
basin
and
a
circular
motion
be
given
to
the
water
all
the
light
substances
will
be
found
crowding
together
near
the
center
of
the
pool
where
there
is
the
least
motion
just
such
a
basin
is
the
atlantic
ocean
to
the
gulf
stream
and
the
sargasso
sea
is
the
center
of
the
whirl
i
share
maurys
view
and
i
was
able
to
study
the
phenomenon
in
this
exclusive
setting
where
ships
rarely
go
above
us
huddled
among
the
brown
weeds
there
floated
objects
originating
from
all
over
tree
trunks
ripped
from
the
rocky
mountains
or
the
andes
and
sent
floating
down
the
amazon
or
the
mississippi
numerous
pieces
of
wreckage
remnants
of
keels
or
undersides
bulwarks
staved
in
and
so
weighed
down
with
seashells
and
barnacles
they
couldnt
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
and
the
passing
years
will
someday
bear
out
maurys
other
view
that
by
collecting
in
this
way
over
the
centuries
these
substances
will
be
turned
to
stone
by
the
action
of
the
waters
and
will
then
form
inexhaustible
coalfields
valuable
reserves
prepared
by
farseeing
nature
for
that
time
when
man
will
have
exhausted
his
mines
on
the
continents
in
the
midst
of
this
hopelessly
tangled
fabric
of
weeds
and
fucus
plants
i
noted
some
delightful
pinkcolored
starshaped
alcyon
coral
sea
anemone
trailing
the
long
tresses
of
their
tentacles
some
green
red
and
blue
jellyfish
and
especially
those
big
rhizostome
jellyfish
that
cuvier
described
whose
bluish
parasols
are
trimmed
with
violet
festoons
we
spent
the
whole
day
of
february
22
in
the
sargasso
sea
where
fish
that
dote
on
marine
plants
and
crustaceans
find
plenty
to
eat
the
next
day
the
ocean
resumed
its
usual
appearance
from
this
moment
on
for
nineteen
days
from
february
23
to
march
12
the
nautilus
stayed
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
hustling
us
along
at
a
constant
speed
of
100
leagues
every
twentyfour
hours
it
was
obvious
that
captain
nemo
wanted
to
carry
out
his
underwater
program
and
i
had
no
doubt
that
he
intended
after
doubling
cape
horn
to
return
to
the
pacific
south
seas
so
ned
land
had
good
reason
to
worry
in
these
wide
seas
empty
of
islands
it
was
no
longer
feasible
to
jump
ship
nor
did
we
have
any
way
to
counter
captain
nemos
whims
we
had
no
choice
but
to
acquiesce
but
if
we
couldnt
attain
our
end
through
force
or
cunning
i
liked
to
think
we
might
achieve
it
through
persuasion
once
this
voyage
was
over
might
not
captain
nemo
consent
to
set
us
free
in
return
for
our
promise
never
to
reveal
his
existence
our
word
of
honor
which
we
sincerely
would
have
kept
however
this
delicate
question
would
have
to
be
negotiated
with
the
captain
but
how
would
he
receive
our
demands
for
freedom
at
the
very
outset
and
in
no
uncertain
terms
hadnt
he
declared
that
the
secret
of
his
life
required
that
we
be
permanently
imprisoned
on
board
the
nautilus
wouldnt
he
see
my
fourmonth
silence
as
a
tacit
acceptance
of
this
situation
would
my
returning
to
this
subject
arouse
suspicions
that
could
jeopardize
our
escape
plans
if
we
had
promising
circumstances
for
trying
again
later
on
i
weighed
all
these
considerations
turned
them
over
in
my
mind
submitted
them
to
conseil
but
he
was
as
baffled
as
i
was
in
short
although
im
not
easily
discouraged
i
realized
that
my
chances
of
ever
seeing
my
fellow
men
again
were
shrinking
by
the
day
especially
at
a
time
when
captain
nemo
was
recklessly
racing
toward
the
south
atlantic
during
those
nineteen
days
just
mentioned
no
unique
incidents
distinguished
our
voyage
i
saw
little
of
the
captain
he
was
at
work
in
the
library
i
often
found
books
he
had
left
open
especially
books
on
natural
history
he
had
thumbed
through
my
work
on
the
great
ocean
depths
and
the
margins
were
covered
with
his
notes
which
sometimes
contradicted
my
theories
and
formulations
but
the
captain
remained
content
with
this
method
of
refining
my
work
and
he
rarely
discussed
it
with
me
sometimes
i
heard
melancholy
sounds
reverberating
from
the
organ
which
he
played
very
expressively
but
only
at
night
in
the
midst
of
the
most
secretive
darkness
while
the
nautilus
slumbered
in
the
wilderness
of
the
ocean
during
this
part
of
our
voyage
we
navigated
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
for
entire
days
the
sea
was
nearly
deserted
a
few
sailing
ships
laden
for
the
east
indies
were
heading
toward
the
cape
of
good
hope
one
day
we
were
chased
by
the
longboats
of
a
whaling
vessel
which
undoubtedly
viewed
us
as
some
enormous
baleen
whale
of
great
value
but
captain
nemo
didnt
want
these
gallant
gentlemen
wasting
their
time
and
energy
so
he
ended
the
hunt
by
diving
beneath
the
waters
this
incident
seemed
to
fascinate
ned
land
intensely
im
sure
the
canadian
was
sorry
that
these
fishermen
couldnt
harpoon
our
sheetiron
cetacean
and
mortally
wound
it
during
this
period
the
fish
conseil
and
i
observed
differed
little
from
those
we
had
already
studied
in
other
latitudes
chief
among
them
were
specimens
of
that
dreadful
cartilaginous
genus
thats
divided
into
three
subgenera
numbering
at
least
thirtytwo
species
striped
sharks
five
meters
long
the
head
squat
and
wider
than
the
body
the
caudal
fin
curved
the
back
with
seven
big
black
parallel
lines
running
lengthwise
then
perlon
sharks
ash
gray
pierced
with
seven
gill
openings
furnished
with
a
single
dorsal
fin
placed
almost
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
body
some
big
dogfish
also
passed
by
a
voracious
species
of
shark
if
there
ever
was
one
with
some
justice
fishermens
yarns
arent
to
be
trusted
but
heres
what
a
few
of
them
relate
inside
the
corpse
of
one
of
these
animals
there
were
found
a
buffalo
head
and
a
whole
calf
in
another
two
tuna
and
a
sailor
in
uniform
in
yet
another
a
soldier
with
his
saber
in
another
finally
a
horse
with
its
rider
in
candor
none
of
these
sounds
like
divinely
inspired
truth
but
the
fact
remains
that
not
a
single
dogfish
let
itself
get
caught
in
the
nautiluss
nets
so
i
cant
vouch
for
their
voracity
schools
of
elegant
playful
dolphin
swam
alongside
for
entire
days
they
went
in
groups
of
five
or
six
hunting
in
packs
like
wolves
over
the
countryside
moreover
theyre
just
as
voracious
as
dogfish
if
i
can
believe
a
certain
copenhagen
professor
who
says
that
from
one
dolphins
stomach
he
removed
thirteen
porpoises
and
fifteen
seals
true
it
was
a
killer
whale
belonging
to
the
biggest
known
species
whose
length
sometimes
exceeds
twentyfour
feet
the
family
delphinia
numbers
ten
genera
and
the
dolphins
i
saw
were
akin
to
the
genus
delphinorhynchus
remarkable
for
an
extremely
narrow
muzzle
four
times
as
long
as
the
cranium
measuring
three
meters
their
bodies
were
black
on
top
underneath
a
pinkish
white
strewn
with
small
very
scattered
spots
from
these
seas
ill
also
mention
some
unusual
specimens
of
croakers
fish
from
the
order
acanthopterygia
family
scienidea
some
authorsmore
artistic
than
scientificclaim
that
these
fish
are
melodious
singers
that
their
voices
in
unison
put
on
concerts
unmatched
by
human
choristers
i
dont
say
nay
but
to
my
regret
these
croakers
didnt
serenade
us
as
we
passed
finally
to
conclude
conseil
classified
a
large
number
of
flying
fish
nothing
could
have
made
a
more
unusual
sight
than
the
marvelous
timing
with
which
dolphins
hunt
these
fish
whatever
the
range
of
its
flight
however
evasive
its
trajectory
even
up
and
over
the
nautilus
the
hapless
flying
fish
always
found
a
dolphin
to
welcome
it
with
open
mouth
these
were
either
flying
gurnards
or
kitelike
sea
robins
whose
lips
glowed
in
the
dark
at
night
scrawling
fiery
streaks
in
the
air
before
plunging
into
the
murky
waters
like
so
many
shooting
stars
our
navigating
continued
under
these
conditions
until
march
13
that
day
the
nautilus
was
put
to
work
in
some
depthsounding
experiments
that
fascinated
me
deeply
by
then
we
had
fared
nearly
13000
leagues
from
our
starting
point
in
the
pacific
high
seas
our
position
fix
placed
us
in
latitude
45
degrees
37
south
and
longitude
37
degrees
53
west
these
were
the
same
waterways
where
captain
denham
aboard
the
herald
payed
out
14000
meters
of
sounding
line
without
finding
bottom
it
was
here
too
that
lieutenant
parker
aboard
the
american
frigate
congress
was
unable
to
reach
the
underwater
soil
at
15149
meters
captain
nemo
decided
to
take
his
nautilus
down
to
the
lowest
depths
in
order
to
doublecheck
these
different
soundings
i
got
ready
to
record
the
results
of
this
experiment
the
panels
in
the
lounge
opened
and
maneuvers
began
for
reaching
those
strata
so
prodigiously
far
removed
it
was
apparently
considered
out
of
the
question
to
dive
by
filling
the
ballast
tanks
perhaps
they
wouldnt
sufficiently
increase
the
nautiluss
specific
gravity
moreover
in
order
to
come
back
up
it
would
be
necessary
to
expel
the
excess
water
and
our
pumps
might
not
have
been
strong
enough
to
overcome
the
outside
pressure
captain
nemo
decided
to
make
for
the
ocean
floor
by
submerging
on
an
appropriately
gradual
diagonal
with
the
help
of
his
side
fins
which
were
set
at
a
45
degrees
angle
to
the
nautiluss
waterline
then
the
propeller
was
brought
to
its
maximum
speed
and
its
four
blades
churned
the
waves
with
indescribable
violence
under
this
powerful
thrust
the
nautiluss
hull
quivered
like
a
resonating
chord
and
the
ship
sank
steadily
under
the
waters
stationed
in
the
lounge
the
captain
and
i
watched
the
needle
swerving
swiftly
over
the
pressure
gauge
soon
we
had
gone
below
the
livable
zone
where
most
fish
reside
some
of
these
animals
can
thrive
only
at
the
surface
of
seas
or
rivers
but
a
minority
can
dwell
at
fairly
great
depths
among
the
latter
i
observed
a
species
of
dogfish
called
the
cow
shark
thats
equipped
with
six
respiratory
slits
the
telescope
fish
with
its
enormous
eyes
the
armored
gurnard
with
gray
thoracic
fins
plus
black
pectoral
fins
and
a
breastplate
protected
by
pale
red
slabs
of
bone
then
finally
the
grenadier
living
at
a
depth
of
1200
meters
by
that
point
tolerating
a
pressure
of
120
atmospheres
i
asked
captain
nemo
if
he
had
observed
any
fish
at
more
considerable
depths
fish
rarely
he
answered
me
but
given
the
current
state
of
marine
science
who
are
we
to
presume
what
do
we
really
know
of
these
depths
just
this
captain
in
going
toward
the
oceans
lower
strata
we
know
that
vegetable
life
disappears
more
quickly
than
animal
life
we
know
that
moving
creatures
can
still
be
encountered
where
water
plants
no
longer
grow
we
know
that
oysters
and
pilgrim
scallops
live
in
2000
meters
of
water
and
that
admiral
mcclintock
englands
hero
of
the
polar
seas
pulled
in
a
live
sea
star
from
a
depth
of
2500
meters
we
know
that
the
crew
of
the
royal
navys
bulldog
fished
up
a
starfish
from
2620
fathoms
hence
from
a
depth
of
more
than
one
vertical
league
would
you
still
say
captain
nemo
that
we
really
know
nothing
no
professor
the
captain
replied
i
wouldnt
be
so
discourteous
yet
ill
ask
you
to
explain
how
these
creatures
can
live
at
such
depths
i
explain
it
on
two
grounds
i
replied
in
the
first
place
because
vertical
currents
which
are
caused
by
differences
in
the
waters
salinity
and
density
can
produce
enough
motion
to
sustain
the
rudimentary
lifestyles
of
sea
lilies
and
starfish
true
the
captain
put
in
in
the
second
place
because
oxygen
is
the
basis
of
life
and
we
know
that
the
amount
of
oxygen
dissolved
in
salt
water
increases
rather
than
decreases
with
depth
that
the
pressure
in
these
lower
strata
helps
to
concentrate
their
oxygen
content
oho
we
know
that
do
we
captain
nemo
replied
in
a
tone
of
mild
surprise
well
professor
we
have
good
reason
to
know
it
because
its
the
truth
i
might
add
in
fact
that
the
air
bladders
of
fish
contain
more
nitrogen
than
oxygen
when
these
animals
are
caught
at
the
surface
of
the
water
and
conversely
more
oxygen
than
nitrogen
when
theyre
pulled
up
from
the
lower
depths
which
bears
out
your
formulation
but
lets
continue
our
observations
my
eyes
flew
back
to
the
pressure
gauge
the
instrument
indicated
a
depth
of
6000
meters
our
submergence
had
been
going
on
for
an
hour
the
nautilus
slid
downward
on
its
slanting
fins
still
sinking
these
deserted
waters
were
wonderfully
clear
with
a
transparency
impossible
to
convey
an
hour
later
we
were
at
13000
metersabout
three
and
a
quarter
vertical
leaguesand
the
ocean
floor
was
nowhere
in
sight
however
at
14000
meters
i
saw
blackish
peaks
rising
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
but
these
summits
could
have
belonged
to
mountains
as
high
or
even
higher
than
the
himalayas
or
mt
blanc
and
the
extent
of
these
depths
remained
incalculable
despite
the
powerful
pressures
it
was
undergoing
the
nautilus
sank
still
deeper
i
could
feel
its
sheetiron
plates
trembling
down
to
their
riveted
joins
metal
bars
arched
bulkheads
groaned
the
lounge
windows
seemed
to
be
warping
inward
under
the
waters
pressure
and
this
whole
sturdy
mechanism
would
surely
have
given
way
if
as
its
captain
had
said
it
werent
capable
of
resisting
like
a
solid
block
while
grazing
these
rocky
slopes
lost
under
the
waters
i
still
spotted
some
seashells
tube
worms
lively
annelid
worms
from
the
genus
spirorbis
and
certain
starfish
specimens
but
soon
these
last
representatives
of
animal
life
vanished
and
three
vertical
leagues
down
the
nautilus
passed
below
the
limits
of
underwater
existence
just
as
an
air
balloon
rises
above
the
breathable
zones
in
the
sky
we
reached
a
depth
of
16000
metersfour
vertical
leaguesand
by
then
the
nautiluss
plating
was
tolerating
a
pressure
of
1600
atmospheres
in
other
words
1600
kilograms
per
each
square
centimeter
on
its
surface
what
an
experience
i
exclaimed
traveling
these
deep
regions
where
no
man
has
ever
ventured
before
look
captain
look
at
these
magnificent
rocks
these
uninhabited
caves
these
last
global
haunts
where
life
is
no
longer
possible
what
unheardof
scenery
and
why
are
we
reduced
to
preserving
it
only
as
a
memory
would
you
like
captain
nemo
asked
me
to
bring
back
more
than
just
a
memory
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
nothing
could
be
easier
than
taking
a
photograph
of
this
underwater
region
before
i
had
time
to
express
the
surprise
this
new
proposition
caused
me
a
camera
was
carried
into
the
lounge
at
captain
nemos
request
the
liquid
setting
electrically
lit
unfolded
with
perfect
clarity
through
the
wideopen
panels
no
shadows
no
blurs
thanks
to
our
artificial
light
not
even
sunshine
could
have
been
better
for
our
purposes
with
the
thrust
of
its
propeller
curbed
by
the
slant
of
its
fins
the
nautilus
stood
still
the
camera
was
aimed
at
the
scenery
on
the
ocean
floor
and
in
a
few
seconds
we
had
a
perfect
negative
i
attach
a
print
of
the
positive
in
it
you
can
view
these
primordial
rocks
that
have
never
seen
the
light
of
day
this
nether
granite
that
forms
the
powerful
foundation
of
our
globe
the
deep
caves
cut
into
the
stony
mass
the
outlines
of
incomparable
distinctness
whose
far
edges
stand
out
in
black
as
if
from
the
brush
of
certain
flemish
painters
in
the
distance
is
a
mountainous
horizon
a
wondrously
undulating
line
that
makes
up
the
background
of
this
landscape
the
general
effect
of
these
smooth
rocks
is
indescribable
black
polished
without
moss
or
other
blemish
carved
into
strange
shapes
sitting
firmly
on
a
carpet
of
sand
that
sparkled
beneath
our
streams
of
electric
light
meanwhile
his
photographic
operations
over
captain
nemo
told
me
lets
go
back
up
professor
we
mustnt
push
our
luck
and
expose
the
nautilus
too
long
to
these
pressures
lets
go
back
up
i
replied
hold
on
tight
before
i
had
time
to
realize
why
the
captain
made
this
recommendation
i
was
hurled
to
the
carpet
its
fins
set
vertically
its
propeller
thrown
in
gear
at
the
captains
signal
the
nautilus
rose
with
lightning
speed
shooting
upward
like
an
air
balloon
into
the
sky
vibrating
resonantly
it
knifed
through
the
watery
mass
not
a
single
detail
was
visible
in
four
minutes
it
had
cleared
the
four
vertical
leagues
separating
it
from
the
surface
of
the
ocean
and
after
emerging
like
a
flying
fish
it
fell
back
into
the
sea
making
the
waves
leap
to
prodigious
heights

and
baleen
whales
during
the
night
of
march
1314
the
nautilus
resumed
its
southward
heading
once
it
was
abreast
of
cape
horn
i
thought
it
would
strike
west
of
the
cape
make
for
pacific
seas
and
complete
its
tour
of
the
world
it
did
nothing
of
the
sort
and
kept
moving
toward
the
southernmost
regions
so
where
was
it
bound
the
pole
that
was
insanity
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
the
captains
recklessness
more
than
justified
ned
lands
worst
fears
for
a
good
while
the
canadian
had
said
nothing
more
to
me
about
his
escape
plans
he
had
become
less
sociable
almost
sullen
i
could
see
how
heavily
this
protracted
imprisonment
was
weighing
on
him
i
could
feel
the
anger
building
in
him
whenever
he
encountered
the
captain
his
eyes
would
flicker
with
dark
fire
and
i
was
in
constant
dread
that
his
natural
vehemence
would
cause
him
to
do
something
rash
that
day
march
14
he
and
conseil
managed
to
find
me
in
my
stateroom
i
asked
them
the
purpose
of
their
visit
to
put
a
simple
question
to
you
sir
the
canadian
answered
me
go
on
ned
how
many
men
do
you
think
are
on
board
the
nautilus
im
unable
to
say
my
friend
it
seems
to
me
ned
land
went
on
that
it
wouldnt
take
much
of
a
crew
to
run
a
ship
like
this
one
correct
i
replied
under
existing
conditions
some
ten
men
at
the
most
should
be
enough
to
operate
it
all
right
the
canadian
said
then
why
should
there
be
any
more
than
that
why
i
answered
i
stared
at
ned
land
whose
motives
were
easy
to
guess
because
i
said
if
i
can
trust
my
hunches
if
i
truly
understand
the
captains
way
of
life
his
nautilus
isnt
simply
a
ship
its
meant
to
be
a
refuge
for
people
like
its
commander
people
who
have
severed
all
ties
with
the
shore
perhaps
conseil
said
but
in
a
nutshell
the
nautilus
can
hold
only
a
certain
number
of
men
so
couldnt
master
estimate
their
maximum
how
conseil
by
calculating
it
master
is
familiar
with
the
ships
capacity
hence
the
amount
of
air
it
contains
on
the
other
hand
master
knows
how
much
air
each
man
consumes
in
the
act
of
breathing
and
he
can
compare
this
data
with
the
fact
that
the
nautilus
must
rise
to
the
surface
every
twentyfour
hours



conseil
didnt
finish
his
sentence
but
i
could
easily
see
what
he
was
driving
at
i
follow
you
i
said
but
while
theyre
simple
to
do
such
calculations
can
give
only
a
very
uncertain
figure
no
problem
the
canadian
went
on
insistently
then
heres
how
to
calculate
it
i
replied
in
one
hour
each
man
consumes
the
oxygen
contained
in
100
liters
of
air
hence
during
twentyfour
hours
the
oxygen
contained
in
2400
liters
therefore
we
must
look
for
the
multiple
of
2400
liters
of
air
that
gives
us
the
amount
found
in
the
nautilus
precisely
conseil
said
now
then
i
went
on
the
nautiluss
capacity
is
1500
metric
tons
and
that
of
a
ton
is
1000
liters
so
the
nautilus
holds
1500000
liters
of
air
which
divided
by
2400



i
did
a
quick
pencil
calculation



gives
us
the
quotient
of
625
which
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
the
air
contained
in
the
nautilus
would
be
exactly
enough
for
625
men
over
twentyfour
hours
625
ned
repeated
but
rest
assured
i
added
that
between
passengers
seamen
or
officers
we
dont
total
onetenth
of
that
figure
which
is
still
too
many
for
three
men
conseil
muttered
so
my
poor
ned
i
can
only
counsel
patience
and
conseil
replied
even
more
than
patience
resignation
conseil
had
said
the
true
word
even
so
he
went
on
captain
nemo
cant
go
south
forever
hell
surely
have
to
stop
if
only
at
the
ice
bank
and
hell
return
to
the
seas
of
civilization
then
it
will
be
time
to
resume
ned
lands
plans
the
canadian
shook
his
head
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
made
no
reply
and
left
us
with
masters
permission
ill
make
an
observation
to
him
conseil
then
told
me
our
poor
ned
broods
about
all
the
things
he
cant
have
hes
haunted
by
his
former
life
he
seems
to
miss
everything
thats
denied
us
hes
obsessed
by
his
old
memories
and
its
breaking
his
heart
we
must
understand
him
what
does
he
have
to
occupy
him
here
nothing
he
isnt
a
scientist
like
master
and
he
doesnt
share
our
enthusiasm
for
the
seas
wonders
he
would
risk
anything
just
to
enter
a
tavern
in
his
own
country
to
be
sure
the
monotony
of
life
on
board
must
have
seemed
unbearable
to
the
canadian
who
was
accustomed
to
freedom
and
activity
it
was
a
rare
event
that
could
excite
him
that
day
however
a
development
occurred
that
reminded
him
of
his
happy
years
as
a
harpooner
near
eleven
oclock
in
the
morning
while
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
nautilus
fell
in
with
a
herd
of
baleen
whales
this
encounter
didnt
surprise
me
because
i
knew
these
animals
were
being
hunted
so
relentlessly
that
they
took
refuge
in
the
ocean
basins
of
the
high
latitudes
in
the
maritime
world
and
in
the
realm
of
geographic
exploration
whales
have
played
a
major
role
this
is
the
animal
that
first
dragged
the
basques
in
its
wake
then
asturian
spaniards
englishmen
and
dutchmen
emboldening
them
against
the
oceans
perils
and
leading
them
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
baleen
whales
like
to
frequent
the
southernmost
and
northernmost
seas
old
legends
even
claim
that
these
cetaceans
led
fishermen
to
within
a
mere
seven
leagues
of
the
north
pole
although
this
feat
is
fictitious
it
will
someday
come
true
because
its
likely
that
by
hunting
whales
in
the
arctic
or
antarctic
regions
man
will
finally
reach
this
unknown
spot
on
the
globe
we
were
seated
on
the
platform
next
to
a
tranquil
sea
the
month
of
march
since
its
the
equivalent
of
october
in
these
latitudes
was
giving
us
some
fine
autumn
days
it
was
the
canadianon
this
topic
he
was
never
mistakenwho
sighted
a
baleen
whale
on
the
eastern
horizon
if
you
looked
carefully
you
could
see
its
blackish
back
alternately
rise
and
fall
above
the
waves
five
miles
from
the
nautilus
wow
ned
land
exclaimed
if
i
were
on
board
a
whaler
theres
an
encounter
that
would
be
great
fun
thats
one
big
animal
look
how
high
its
blowholes
are
spouting
all
that
air
and
steam
damnation
why
am
i
chained
to
this
hunk
of
sheet
iron
why
ned
i
replied
you
still
arent
over
your
old
fishing
urges
how
could
a
whale
fisherman
forget
his
old
trade
sir
who
could
ever
get
tired
of
such
exciting
hunting
youve
never
fished
these
seas
ned
never
sir
just
the
northernmost
seas
equally
in
the
bering
strait
and
the
davis
strait
so
the
southern
right
whale
is
still
unknown
to
you
until
now
its
the
bowhead
whale
youve
hunted
and
it
wont
risk
going
past
the
warm
waters
of
the
equator
oh
professor
what
are
you
feeding
me
the
canadian
answered
in
a
tolerably
skeptical
tone
im
feeding
you
the
facts
by
thunder
in
65
just
two
and
a
half
years
ago
i
to
whom
you
speak
i
myself
stepped
onto
the
carcass
of
a
whale
near
greenland
and
its
flank
still
carried
the
marked
harpoon
of
a
whaling
ship
from
the
bering
sea
now
i
ask
you
after
it
had
been
wounded
west
of
america
how
could
this
animal
be
killed
in
the
east
unless
it
had
cleared
the
equator
and
doubled
cape
horn
or
the
cape
of
good
hope
i
agree
with
our
friend
ned
conseil
said
and
im
waiting
to
hear
how
master
will
reply
to
him
master
will
reply
my
friends
that
baleen
whales
are
localized
according
to
species
within
certain
seas
that
they
never
leave
and
if
one
of
these
animals
went
from
the
bering
strait
to
the
davis
strait
its
quite
simply
because
theres
some
passageway
from
the
one
sea
to
the
other
either
along
the
coasts
of
canada
or
siberia
you
expect
us
to
fall
for
that
the
canadian
asked
tipping
me
a
wink
if
master
says
so
conseil
replied
which
means
the
canadian
went
on
since
ive
never
fished
these
waterways
i
dont
know
the
whales
that
frequent
them
thats
what
ive
been
telling
you
ned
all
the
more
reason
to
get
to
know
them
conseil
answered
look
look
the
canadian
exclaimed
his
voice
full
of
excitement
its
approaching
its
coming
toward
us
its
thumbing
its
nose
at
me
it
knows
i
cant
do
a
blessed
thing
to
it
ned
stamped
his
foot
brandishing
an
imaginary
harpoon
his
hands
positively
trembled
these
cetaceans
he
asked
are
they
as
big
as
the
ones
in
the
northernmost
seas
pretty
nearly
ned
because
ive
seen
big
baleen
whales
sir
whales
measuring
up
to
100
feet
long
ive
even
heard
that
those
rorqual
whales
off
the
aleutian
islands
sometimes
get
over
150
feet
that
strikes
me
as
exaggerated
i
replied
those
animals
are
only
members
of
the
genus
balaenoptera
furnished
with
dorsal
fins
and
like
sperm
whales
theyre
generally
smaller
than
the
bowhead
whale
oh
exclaimed
the
canadian
whose
eyes
hadnt
left
the
ocean
its
getting
closer
its
coming
into
the
nautiluss
waters
then
going
on
with
his
conversation
you
talk
about
sperm
whales
he
said
as
if
they
were
little
beasts
but
there
are
stories
of
gigantic
sperm
whales
theyre
shrewd
cetaceans
i
hear
that
some
will
cover
themselves
with
algae
and
fucus
plants
people
mistake
them
for
islets
they
pitch
camp
on
top
make
themselves
at
home
light
a
fire
build
houses
conseil
said
yes
funny
man
ned
land
replied
then
one
fine
day
the
animal
dives
and
drags
all
its
occupants
down
into
the
depths
like
in
the
voyages
of
sinbad
the
sailor
i
answered
laughing
oh
mr
land
youre
addicted
to
tall
tales
what
sperm
whales
youre
handing
us
i
hope
you
dont
really
believe
in
them
mr
naturalist
the
canadian
replied
in
all
seriousness
when
it
comes
to
whales
you
can
believe
anything
look
at
that
one
move
look
at
it
stealing
away
people
claim
these
animals
can
circle
around
the
world
in
just
fifteen
days
i
dont
say
nay
but
what
you
undoubtedly
dont
know
professor
aronnax
is
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
world
whales
traveled
even
quicker
oh
really
ned
and
why
so
because
in
those
days
their
tails
moved
side
to
side
like
those
on
fish
in
other
words
their
tails
were
straight
up
thrashing
the
water
from
left
to
right
right
to
left
but
spotting
that
they
swam
too
fast
our
creator
twisted
their
tails
and
ever
since
theyve
been
thrashing
the
waves
up
and
down
at
the
expense
of
their
speed
fine
ned
i
said
then
resurrected
one
of
the
canadians
expressions
you
expect
us
to
fall
for
that
not
too
terribly
ned
land
replied
and
no
more
than
if
i
told
you
there
are
whales
that
are
300
feet
long
and
weigh
1000000
pounds
thats
indeed
considerable
i
said
but
you
must
admit
that
certain
cetaceans
do
grow
to
significant
size
since
theyre
said
to
supply
as
much
as
120
metric
tons
of
oil
that
ive
seen
the
canadian
said
i
can
easily
believe
it
ned
just
as
i
can
believe
that
certain
baleen
whales
equal
100
elephants
in
bulk
imagine
the
impact
of
such
a
mass
if
it
were
launched
at
full
speed
is
it
true
conseil
asked
that
they
can
sink
ships
ships
i
doubt
it
i
replied
however
they
say
that
in
1820
right
in
these
southern
seas
a
baleen
whale
rushed
at
the
essex
and
pushed
it
backward
at
a
speed
of
four
meters
per
second
its
stern
was
flooded
and
the
essex
went
down
fast
ned
looked
at
me
with
a
bantering
expression
speaking
for
myself
he
said
i
once
got
walloped
by
a
whales
tailin
my
longboat
needless
to
say
my
companions
and
i
were
launched
to
an
altitude
of
six
meters
but
next
to
the
professors
whale
mine
was
just
a
baby
do
these
animals
live
a
long
time
conseil
asked
a
thousand
years
the
canadian
replied
without
hesitation
and
how
ned
i
asked
do
you
know
thats
so
because
people
say
so
and
why
do
people
say
so
because
people
know
so
no
ned
people
dont
know
so
they
suppose
so
and
heres
the
logic
with
which
they
back
up
their
beliefs
when
fishermen
first
hunted
whales
400
years
ago
these
animals
grew
to
bigger
sizes
than
they
do
today
reasonably
enough
its
assumed
that
todays
whales
are
smaller
because
they
havent
had
time
to
reach
their
full
growth
thats
why
the
count
de
buffons
encyclopedia
says
that
cetaceans
can
live
and
even
must
live
for
a
thousand
years
you
understand
ned
land
didnt
understand
he
no
longer
even
heard
me
that
baleen
whale
kept
coming
closer
his
eyes
devoured
it
oh
he
exclaimed
its
not
just
one
whale
its
ten
twenty
a
whole
gam
and
i
cant
do
a
thing
im
tied
hand
and
foot
but
ned
my
friend
conseil
said
why
not
ask
captain
nemo
for
permission
to
hunt
before
conseil
could
finish
his
sentence
ned
land
scooted
down
the
hatch
and
ran
to
look
for
the
captain
a
few
moments
later
the
two
of
them
reappeared
on
the
platform
captain
nemo
observed
the
herd
of
cetaceans
cavorting
on
the
waters
a
mile
from
the
nautilus
theyre
southern
right
whales
he
said
there
goes
the
fortune
of
a
whole
whaling
fleet
well
sir
the
canadian
asked
couldnt
i
hunt
them
just
so
i
dont
forget
my
old
harpooning
trade
hunt
them
what
for
captain
nemo
replied
simply
to
destroy
them
we
have
no
use
for
whale
oil
on
this
ship
but
sir
the
canadian
went
on
in
the
red
sea
you
authorized
us
to
chase
a
dugong
there
it
was
an
issue
of
obtaining
fresh
meat
for
my
crew
here
it
would
be
killing
for
the
sake
of
killing
im
well
aware
thats
a
privilege
reserved
for
mankind
but
i
dont
allow
such
murderous
pastimes
when
your
peers
mr
land
destroy
decent
harmless
creatures
like
the
southern
right
whale
or
the
bowhead
whale
they
commit
a
reprehensible
offense
thus
theyve
already
depopulated
all
of
baffin
bay
and
theyll
wipe
out
a
whole
class
of
useful
animals
so
leave
these
poor
cetaceans
alone
they
have
quite
enough
natural
enemies
such
as
sperm
whales
swordfish
and
sawfish
without
you
meddling
with
them
ill
let
the
reader
decide
what
faces
the
canadian
made
during
this
lecture
on
hunting
ethics
furnishing
such
arguments
to
a
professional
harpooner
was
a
waste
of
words
ned
land
stared
at
captain
nemo
and
obviously
missed
his
meaning
but
the
captain
was
right
thanks
to
the
mindless
barbaric
bloodthirstiness
of
fishermen
the
last
baleen
whale
will
someday
disappear
from
the
ocean
ned
land
whistled
yankee
doodle
between
his
teeth
stuffed
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
turned
his
back
on
us
meanwhile
captain
nemo
studied
the
herd
of
cetaceans
then
addressed
me
i
was
right
to
claim
that
baleen
whales
have
enough
natural
enemies
without
counting
man
these
specimens
will
soon
have
to
deal
with
mighty
opponents
eight
miles
to
leeward
professor
aronnax
can
you
see
those
blackish
specks
moving
about
yes
captain
i
replied
those
are
sperm
whales
dreadful
animals
that
ive
sometimes
encountered
in
herds
of
200
or
300
as
for
them
theyre
cruel
destructive
beasts
and
they
deserve
to
be
exterminated
the
canadian
turned
swiftly
at
these
last
words
well
captain
i
said
on
behalf
of
the
baleen
whales
theres
still
time
its
pointless
to
run
any
risks
professor
the
nautilus
will
suffice
to
disperse
these
sperm
whales
its
armed
with
a
steel
spur
quite
equal
to
mr
lands
harpoon
i
imagine
the
canadian
didnt
even
bother
shrugging
his
shoulders
attacking
cetaceans
with
thrusts
from
a
spur
who
ever
heard
of
such
malarkey
wait
and
see
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
said
well
show
you
a
style
of
hunting
with
which
you
arent
yet
familiar
well
take
no
pity
on
these
ferocious
cetaceans
theyre
merely
mouth
and
teeth
mouth
and
teeth
theres
no
better
way
to
describe
the
longskulled
sperm
whale
whose
length
sometimes
exceeds
twentyfive
meters
the
enormous
head
of
this
cetacean
occupies
about
a
third
of
its
body
better
armed
than
a
baleen
whale
whose
upper
jaw
is
adorned
solely
with
whalebone
the
sperm
whale
is
equipped
with
twentyfive
huge
teeth
that
are
twenty
centimeters
high
have
cylindrical
conical
summits
and
weigh
two
pounds
each
in
the
top
part
of
this
enormous
head
inside
big
cavities
separated
by
cartilage
youll
find
300
to
400
kilograms
of
that
valuable
oil
called
spermaceti
the
sperm
whale
is
an
awkward
animal
more
tadpole
than
fish
as
professor
frdol
has
noted
its
poorly
constructed
being
defective
so
to
speak
over
the
whole
left
side
of
its
frame
with
good
eyesight
only
in
its
right
eye
meanwhile
that
monstrous
herd
kept
coming
closer
it
had
seen
the
baleen
whales
and
was
preparing
to
attack
you
could
tell
in
advance
that
the
sperm
whales
would
be
victorious
not
only
because
they
were
better
built
for
fighting
than
their
harmless
adversaries
but
also
because
they
could
stay
longer
underwater
before
returning
to
breathe
at
the
surface
there
was
just
time
to
run
to
the
rescue
of
the
baleen
whales
the
nautilus
proceeded
to
midwater
conseil
ned
and
i
sat
in
front
of
the
lounge
windows
captain
nemo
made
his
way
to
the
helmsmans
side
to
operate
his
submersible
as
an
engine
of
destruction
soon
i
felt
the
beats
of
our
propeller
getting
faster
and
we
picked
up
speed
the
battle
between
sperm
whales
and
baleen
whales
had
already
begun
when
the
nautilus
arrived
it
maneuvered
to
cut
into
the
herd
of
longskulled
predators
at
first
the
latter
showed
little
concern
at
the
sight
of
this
new
monster
meddling
in
the
battle
but
they
soon
had
to
sidestep
its
thrusts
what
a
struggle
ned
land
quickly
grew
enthusiastic
and
even
ended
up
applauding
brandished
in
its
captains
hands
the
nautilus
was
simply
a
fearsome
harpoon
he
hurled
it
at
those
fleshy
masses
and
ran
them
clean
through
leaving
behind
two
squirming
animal
halves
as
for
those
daunting
strokes
of
the
tail
hitting
our
sides
the
ship
never
felt
them
no
more
than
the
collisions
it
caused
one
sperm
whale
exterminated
it
ran
at
another
tacked
on
the
spot
so
as
not
to
miss
its
prey
went
ahead
or
astern
obeyed
its
rudder
dived
when
the
cetacean
sank
to
deeper
strata
rose
with
it
when
it
returned
to
the
surface
struck
it
headon
or
slantwise
hacked
at
it
or
tore
it
and
from
every
direction
and
at
any
speed
skewered
it
with
its
dreadful
spur
what
bloodshed
what
a
hubbub
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
what
sharp
hisses
and
snorts
unique
to
these
frightened
animals
their
tails
churned
the
normally
peaceful
strata
into
actual
billows
this
homeric
slaughter
dragged
on
for
an
hour
and
the
longskulled
predators
couldnt
get
away
several
times
ten
or
twelve
of
them
teamed
up
trying
to
crush
the
nautilus
with
their
sheer
mass
through
the
windows
you
could
see
their
enormous
mouths
paved
with
teeth
their
fearsome
eyes
losing
all
selfcontrol
ned
land
hurled
threats
and
insults
at
them
you
could
feel
them
clinging
to
the
submersible
like
hounds
atop
a
wild
boar
in
the
underbrush
but
by
forcing
the
pace
of
its
propeller
the
nautilus
carried
them
off
dragged
them
under
or
brought
them
back
to
the
upper
level
of
the
waters
untroubled
by
their
enormous
weight
or
their
powerful
grip
finally
this
mass
of
sperm
whales
thinned
out
the
waves
grew
tranquil
again
i
felt
us
rising
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
hatch
opened
and
we
rushed
onto
the
platform
the
sea
was
covered
with
mutilated
corpses
a
fearsome
explosion
couldnt
have
slashed
torn
or
shredded
these
fleshy
masses
with
greater
violence
we
were
floating
in
the
midst
of
gigantic
bodies
bluish
on
the
back
whitish
on
the
belly
and
all
deformed
by
enormous
protuberances
a
few
frightened
sperm
whales
were
fleeing
toward
the
horizon
the
waves
were
dyed
red
over
an
area
of
several
miles
and
the
nautilus
was
floating
in
the
middle
of
a
sea
of
blood
captain
nemo
rejoined
us
well
mr
land
he
said
well
sir
replied
the
canadian
whose
enthusiasm
had
subsided
its
a
dreadful
sight
for
sure
but
im
a
hunter
not
a
butcher
and
this
is
plain
butchery
it
was
a
slaughter
of
destructive
animals
the
captain
replied
and
the
nautilus
is
no
butcher
knife
i
prefer
my
harpoon
the
canadian
answered
to
each
his
own
the
captain
replied
staring
intently
at
ned
land
i
was
in
dread
the
latter
would
give
way
to
some
violent
outburst
that
might
have
had
deplorable
consequences
but
his
anger
was
diverted
by
the
sight
of
a
baleen
whale
that
the
nautilus
had
pulled
alongside
of
just
then
this
animal
had
been
unable
to
escape
the
teeth
of
those
sperm
whales
i
recognized
the
southern
right
whale
its
head
squat
its
body
dark
all
over
anatomically
its
distinguished
from
the
white
whale
and
the
black
right
whale
by
the
fusion
of
its
seven
cervical
vertebrae
and
it
numbers
two
more
ribs
than
its
relatives
floating
on
its
side
its
belly
riddled
with
bites
the
poor
cetacean
was
dead
still
hanging
from
the
tip
of
its
mutilated
fin
was
a
little
baby
whale
that
it
had
been
unable
to
rescue
from
the
slaughter
its
open
mouth
let
water
flow
through
its
whalebone
like
a
murmuring
surf
captain
nemo
guided
the
nautilus
next
to
the
animals
corpse
two
of
his
men
climbed
onto
the
whales
flank
and
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
them
draw
from
its
udders
all
the
milk
they
held
in
other
words
enough
to
fill
two
or
three
casks
the
captain
offered
me
a
cup
of
this
stillwarm
milk
i
couldnt
help
showing
my
distaste
for
such
a
beverage
he
assured
me
that
this
milk
was
excellent
no
different
from
cows
milk
i
sampled
it
and
agreed
so
this
milk
was
a
worthwhile
reserve
ration
for
us
because
in
the
form
of
salt
butter
or
cheese
it
would
provide
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
from
our
standard
fare
from
that
day
on
i
noted
with
some
uneasiness
that
ned
lands
attitudes
toward
captain
nemo
grew
worse
and
worse
and
i
decided
to
keep
a
close
watch
on
the
canadians
movements
and
activities

the

bank
the
nautilus
resumed
its
unruffled
southbound
heading
it
went
along
the
50th
meridian
with
considerable
speed
would
it
go
to
the
pole
i
didnt
think
so
because
every
previous
attempt
to
reach
this
spot
on
the
globe
had
failed
besides
the
season
was
already
quite
advanced
since
march
13
on
antarctic
shores
corresponds
with
september
13
in
the
northernmost
regions
which
marks
the
beginning
of
the
equinoctial
period
on
march
14
at
latitude
55
degrees
i
spotted
floating
ice
plain
pale
bits
of
rubble
twenty
to
twentyfive
feet
long
which
formed
reefs
over
which
the
sea
burst
into
foam
the
nautilus
stayed
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
having
fished
in
the
arctic
seas
ned
land
was
already
familiar
with
the
sight
of
icebergs
conseil
and
i
were
marveling
at
them
for
the
first
time
in
the
sky
toward
the
southern
horizon
there
stretched
a
dazzling
white
band
english
whalers
have
given
this
the
name
ice
blink
no
matter
how
heavy
the
clouds
may
be
they
cant
obscure
this
phenomenon
it
announces
the
presence
of
a
pack
or
shoal
of
ice
indeed
larger
blocks
of
ice
soon
appeared
their
brilliance
varying
at
the
whim
of
the
mists
some
of
these
masses
displayed
green
veins
as
if
scrawled
with
undulating
lines
of
copper
sulfate
others
looked
like
enormous
amethysts
letting
the
light
penetrate
their
insides
the
latter
reflected
the
suns
rays
from
the
thousand
facets
of
their
crystals
the
former
tinted
with
a
bright
limestone
sheen
would
have
supplied
enough
building
material
to
make
a
whole
marble
town
the
farther
down
south
we
went
the
more
these
floating
islands
grew
in
numbers
and
prominence
polar
birds
nested
on
them
by
the
thousands
these
were
petrels
cape
pigeons
or
puffins
and
their
calls
were
deafening
mistaking
the
nautilus
for
the
corpse
of
a
whale
some
of
them
alighted
on
it
and
prodded
its
resonant
sheet
iron
with
pecks
of
their
beaks
during
this
navigating
in
the
midst
of
the
ice
captain
nemo
often
stayed
on
the
platform
he
observed
these
deserted
waterways
carefully
i
saw
his
calm
eyes
sometimes
perk
up
in
these
polar
seas
forbidden
to
man
did
he
feel
right
at
home
the
lord
of
these
unreachable
regions
perhaps
but
he
didnt
say
he
stood
still
reviving
only
when
his
pilots
instincts
took
over
then
steering
his
nautilus
with
consummate
dexterity
he
skillfully
dodged
the
masses
of
ice
some
of
which
measured
several
miles
in
length
their
heights
varying
from
seventy
to
eighty
meters
often
the
horizon
seemed
completely
closed
off
abreast
of
latitude
60
degrees
every
passageway
had
disappeared
searching
with
care
captain
nemo
soon
found
a
narrow
opening
into
which
he
brazenly
slipped
well
aware
however
that
it
would
close
behind
him
guided
by
his
skillful
hands
the
nautilus
passed
by
all
these
different
masses
of
ice
which
are
classified
by
size
and
shape
with
a
precision
that
enraptured
conseil
icebergs
or
mountains
ice
fields
or
smooth
limitless
tracts
drift
ice
or
floating
floes
packs
or
broken
tracts
called
patches
when
theyre
circular
and
streams
when
they
form
long
strips
the
temperature
was
fairly
low
exposed
to
the
outside
air
the
thermometer
marked
2
degrees
to
3
degrees
centigrade
but
we
were
warmly
dressed
in
furs
for
which
seals
and
aquatic
bears
had
paid
the
price
evenly
heated
by
all
its
electric
equipment
the
nautiluss
interior
defied
the
most
intense
cold
moreover
to
find
a
bearable
temperature
the
ship
had
only
to
sink
just
a
few
meters
beneath
the
waves
two
months
earlier
we
would
have
enjoyed
perpetual
daylight
in
this
latitude
but
night
already
fell
for
three
or
four
hours
and
later
it
would
cast
six
months
of
shadow
over
these
circumpolar
regions
on
march
15
we
passed
beyond
the
latitude
of
the
south
shetland
and
south
orkney
islands
the
captain
told
me
that
many
tribes
of
seals
used
to
inhabit
these
shores
but
english
and
american
whalers
in
a
frenzy
of
destruction
slaughtered
all
the
adults
including
pregnant
females
and
where
life
and
activity
once
existed
those
fishermen
left
behind
only
silence
and
death
going
along
the
55th
meridian
the
nautilus
cut
the
antarctic
circle
on
march
16
near
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
ice
completely
surrounded
us
and
closed
off
the
horizon
nevertheless
captain
nemo
went
from
passageway
to
passageway
always
proceeding
south
but
wheres
he
going
i
asked
straight
ahead
conseil
replied
ultimately
when
he
cant
go
any
farther
hell
stop
i
wouldnt
bet
on
it
i
replied
and
in
all
honesty
i
confess
that
this
venturesome
excursion
was
far
from
displeasing
to
me
i
cant
express
the
intensity
of
my
amazement
at
the
beauties
of
these
new
regions
the
ice
struck
superb
poses
here
its
general
effect
suggested
an
oriental
town
with
countless
minarets
and
mosques
there
a
city
in
ruins
flung
to
the
ground
by
convulsions
in
the
earth
these
views
were
varied
continuously
by
the
suns
oblique
rays
or
were
completely
swallowed
up
by
gray
mists
in
the
middle
of
blizzards
then
explosions
caveins
and
great
iceberg
somersaults
would
occur
all
around
us
altering
the
scenery
like
the
changing
landscape
in
a
diorama
if
the
nautilus
was
submerged
during
these
losses
of
balance
we
heard
the
resulting
noises
spread
under
the
waters
with
frightful
intensity
and
the
collapse
of
these
masses
created
daunting
eddies
down
to
the
oceans
lower
strata
the
nautilus
then
rolled
and
pitched
like
a
ship
left
to
the
fury
of
the
elements
often
no
longer
seeing
any
way
out
i
thought
we
were
imprisoned
for
good
but
captain
nemo
guided
by
his
instincts
discovered
new
passageways
from
the
tiniest
indications
he
was
never
wrong
when
he
observed
slender
threads
of
bluish
water
streaking
through
these
ice
fields
accordingly
i
was
sure
that
he
had
already
risked
his
nautilus
in
the
midst
of
the
antarctic
seas
however
during
the
day
of
march
16
these
tracts
of
ice
completely
barred
our
path
it
wasnt
the
ice
bank
as
yet
just
huge
ice
fields
cemented
together
by
the
cold
this
obstacle
couldnt
stop
captain
nemo
and
he
launched
his
ship
against
the
ice
fields
with
hideous
violence
the
nautilus
went
into
these
brittle
masses
like
a
wedge
splitting
them
with
dreadful
cracklings
it
was
an
oldfashioned
battering
ram
propelled
with
infinite
power
hurled
aloft
ice
rubble
fell
back
around
us
like
hail
through
brute
force
alone
the
submersible
carved
out
a
channel
for
itself
carried
away
by
its
momentum
the
ship
sometimes
mounted
on
top
of
these
tracts
of
ice
and
crushed
them
with
its
weight
or
at
other
times
when
cooped
up
beneath
the
ice
fields
it
split
them
with
simple
pitching
movements
creating
wide
punctures
violent
squalls
assaulted
us
during
the
daytime
thanks
to
certain
heavy
mists
we
couldnt
see
from
one
end
of
the
platform
to
the
other
the
wind
shifted
abruptly
to
every
point
on
the
compass
the
snow
was
piling
up
in
such
packed
layers
it
had
to
be
chipped
loose
with
blows
from
picks
even
in
a
temperature
of
merely
5
degrees
centigrade
every
outside
part
of
the
nautilus
was
covered
with
ice
a
ships
rigging
would
have
been
unusable
because
all
its
tackle
would
have
jammed
in
the
grooves
of
the
pulleys
only
a
craft
without
sails
driven
by
an
electric
motor
that
needed
no
coal
could
face
such
high
latitudes
under
these
conditions
the
barometer
generally
stayed
quite
low
it
fell
as
far
as
735
centimeters
our
compass
indications
no
longer
offered
any
guarantees
the
deranged
needles
would
mark
contradictory
directions
as
we
approached
the
southern
magnetic
pole
which
doesnt
coincide
with
the
south
pole
proper
in
fact
according
to
the
astronomer
hansteen
this
magnetic
pole
is
located
fairly
close
to
latitude
70
degrees
and
longitude
130
degrees
or
abiding
by
the
observations
of
louisisidore
duperrey
in
longitude
135
degrees
and
latitude
70
degrees
30
hence
we
had
to
transport
compasses
to
different
parts
of
the
ship
take
many
readings
and
strike
an
average
often
we
could
chart
our
course
only
by
guesswork
a
less
than
satisfactory
method
in
the
midst
of
these
winding
passageways
whose
landmarks
change
continuously
at
last
on
march
18
after
twenty
futile
assaults
the
nautilus
was
decisively
held
in
check
no
longer
was
it
an
ice
stream
patch
or
fieldit
was
an
endless
immovable
barrier
formed
by
ice
mountains
fused
to
each
other
the
ice
bank
the
canadian
told
me
for
ned
land
as
well
as
for
every
navigator
before
us
i
knew
that
this
was
the
great
insurmountable
obstacle
when
the
sun
appeared
for
an
instant
near
noon
captain
nemo
took
a
reasonably
accurate
sight
that
gave
our
position
as
longitude
51
degrees
30
and
latitude
67
degrees
39
south
this
was
a
position
already
well
along
in
these
antarctic
regions
as
for
the
liquid
surface
of
the
sea
there
was
no
longer
any
semblance
of
it
before
our
eyes
before
the
nautiluss
spur
there
lay
vast
broken
plains
a
tangle
of
confused
chunks
with
all
the
helterskelter
unpredictability
typical
of
a
rivers
surface
a
short
while
before
its
ice
breakup
but
in
this
case
the
proportions
were
gigantic
here
and
there
stood
sharp
peaks
lean
spires
that
rose
as
high
as
200
feet
farther
off
a
succession
of
steeply
cut
cliffs
sporting
a
grayish
tint
huge
mirrors
that
reflected
the
sparse
rays
of
a
sun
half
drowned
in
mist
beyond
a
stark
silence
reigned
in
this
desolate
natural
setting
a
silence
barely
broken
by
the
flapping
wings
of
petrels
or
puffins
by
this
point
everything
was
frozen
even
sound
so
the
nautilus
had
to
halt
in
its
venturesome
course
among
these
tracts
of
ice
sir
ned
land
told
me
that
day
if
your
captain
goes
any
farther



yes
hell
be
a
superman
how
so
ned
because
nobody
can
clear
the
ice
bank
your
captains
a
powerful
man
but
damnation
he
isnt
more
powerful
than
nature
if
she
draws
a
boundary
line
there
you
stop
like
it
or
not
correct
ned
land
but
i
still
want
to
know
whats
behind
this
ice
bank
behold
my
greatest
source
of
irritationa
wall
master
is
right
conseil
said
walls
were
invented
simply
to
frustrate
scientists
all
walls
should
be
banned
fine
the
canadian
put
in
but
we
already
know
whats
behind
this
ice
bank
what
i
asked
ice
ice
and
more
ice
you
may
be
sure
of
that
ned
i
answered
but
im
not
thats
why
i
want
to
see
for
myself
well
professor
the
canadian
replied
you
can
just
drop
that
idea
youve
made
it
to
the
ice
bank
which
is
already
far
enough
but
you
wont
get
any
farther
neither
your
captain
nemo
or
his
nautilus
and
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
well
head
north
again
in
other
words
to
the
land
of
sensible
people
i
had
to
agree
that
ned
land
was
right
and
until
ships
are
built
to
navigate
over
tracts
of
ice
theyll
have
to
stop
at
the
ice
bank
indeed
despite
its
efforts
despite
the
powerful
methods
it
used
to
split
this
ice
the
nautilus
was
reduced
to
immobility
ordinarily
when
someone
cant
go
any
farther
he
still
has
the
option
of
returning
in
his
tracks
but
here
it
was
just
as
impossible
to
turn
back
as
to
go
forward
because
every
passageway
had
closed
behind
us
and
if
our
submersible
remained
even
slightly
stationary
it
would
be
frozen
in
without
delay
which
is
exactly
what
happened
near
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
and
fresh
ice
kept
forming
over
the
ships
sides
with
astonishing
speed
i
had
to
admit
that
captain
nemos
leadership
had
been
most
injudicious
just
then
i
was
on
the
platform
observing
the
situation
for
some
while
the
captain
said
to
me
well
professor
what
think
you
i
think
were
trapped
captain
trapped
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
we
cant
go
forward
backward
or
sideways
i
think
thats
the
standard
definition
of
trapped
at
least
in
the
civilized
world
so
professor
aronnax
you
think
the
nautilus
wont
be
able
to
float
clear
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
captain
since
the
season
is
already
too
advanced
for
you
to
depend
on
an
ice
breakup
oh
professor
captain
nemo
replied
in
an
ironic
tone
you
never
change
you
see
only
impediments
and
obstacles
i
promise
you
not
only
will
the
nautilus
float
clear
it
will
go
farther
still
farther
south
i
asked
gaping
at
the
captain
yes
sir
it
will
go
to
the
pole
to
the
pole
i
exclaimed
unable
to
keep
back
a
movement
of
disbelief
yes
the
captain
replied
coolly
the
antarctic
pole
that
unknown
spot
crossed
by
every
meridian
on
the
globe
as
you
know
i
do
whatever
i
like
with
my
nautilus
yes
i
did
know
that
i
knew
this
man
was
daring
to
the
point
of
being
foolhardy
but
to
overcome
all
the
obstacles
around
the
south
poleeven
more
unattainable
than
the
north
pole
which
still
hadnt
been
reached
by
the
boldest
navigatorswasnt
this
an
absolutely
insane
undertaking
one
that
could
occur
only
in
the
brain
of
a
madman
it
then
dawned
on
me
to
ask
captain
nemo
if
he
had
already
discovered
this
pole
which
no
human
being
had
ever
trod
underfoot
no
sir
he
answered
me
but
well
discover
it
together
where
others
have
failed
ill
succeed
never
before
has
my
nautilus
cruised
so
far
into
these
southernmost
seas
but
i
repeat
it
will
go
farther
still
id
like
to
believe
you
captain
i
went
on
in
a
tone
of
some
sarcasm
oh
i
do
believe
you
lets
forge
ahead
there
are
no
obstacles
for
us
lets
shatter
this
ice
bank
lets
blow
it
up
and
if
it
still
resists
lets
put
wings
on
the
nautilus
and
fly
over
it
over
it
professor
captain
nemo
replied
serenely
no
not
over
it
but
under
it
under
it
i
exclaimed
a
sudden
insight
into
captain
nemos
plans
had
just
flashed
through
my
mind
i
understood
the
marvelous
talents
of
his
nautilus
would
be
put
to
work
once
again
in
this
superhuman
undertaking
i
can
see
were
starting
to
understand
each
other
professor
captain
nemo
told
me
with
a
half
smile
you
already
glimpse
the
potentialmyself
id
say
the
successof
this
attempt
maneuvers
that
arent
feasible
for
an
ordinary
ship
are
easy
for
the
nautilus
if
a
continent
emerges
at
the
pole
well
stop
at
that
continent
but
on
the
other
hand
if
open
sea
washes
the
pole
well
go
to
that
very
place
right
i
said
carried
away
by
the
captains
logic
even
though
the
surface
of
the
sea
has
solidified
into
ice
its
lower
strata
are
still
open
thanks
to
that
divine
justice
that
puts
the
maximum
density
of
salt
water
one
degree
above
its
freezing
point
and
if
im
not
mistaken
the
submerged
part
of
this
ice
bank
is
in
a
fourtoone
ratio
to
its
emerging
part
very
nearly
professor
for
each
foot
of
iceberg
above
the
sea
there
are
three
more
below
now
then
since
these
ice
mountains
dont
exceed
a
height
of
100
meters
they
sink
only
to
a
depth
of
300
meters
and
what
are
300
meters
to
the
nautilus
a
mere
nothing
sir
we
could
even
go
to
greater
depths
and
find
that
temperature
layer
common
to
all
ocean
water
and
there
wed
brave
with
impunity
the
30
degrees
or
40
degrees
cold
on
the
surface
true
sir
very
true
i
replied
with
growing
excitement
our
sole
difficulty
captain
nemo
went
on
lies
in
our
staying
submerged
for
several
days
without
renewing
our
air
supply
thats
all
i
answered
the
nautilus
has
huge
air
tanks
well
fill
them
up
and
theyll
supply
all
the
oxygen
we
need
good
thinking
professor
aronnax
the
captain
replied
with
a
smile
but
since
i
dont
want
to
be
accused
of
foolhardiness
im
giving
you
all
my
objections
in
advance
you
have
more
just
one
if
a
sea
exists
at
the
south
pole
its
possible
this
sea
may
be
completely
frozen
over
so
we
couldnt
come
up
to
the
surface
my
dear
sir
have
you
forgotten
that
the
nautilus
is
armed
with
a
fearsome
spur
couldnt
it
be
launched
diagonally
against
those
tracts
of
ice
which
would
break
open
from
the
impact
ah
professor
youre
full
of
ideas
today
besides
captain
i
added
with
still
greater
enthusiasm
why
wouldnt
we
find
open
sea
at
the
south
pole
just
as
at
the
north
pole
the
coldtemperature
poles
and
the
geographical
poles
dont
coincide
in
either
the
northern
or
southern
hemispheres
and
until
proof
to
the
contrary
we
can
assume
these
two
spots
on
the
earth
feature
either
a
continent
or
an
icefree
ocean
i
think
as
you
do
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
replied
ill
only
point
out
that
after
raising
so
many
objections
against
my
plan
youre
now
crushing
me
under
arguments
in
its
favor
captain
nemo
was
right
i
was
outdoing
him
in
daring
it
was
i
who
was
sweeping
him
to
the
pole
i
was
leading
the
way
i
was
out
in
front



but
no
you
silly
fool
captain
nemo
already
knew
the
pros
and
cons
of
this
question
and
it
amused
him
to
see
you
flying
off
into
impossible
fantasies
nevertheless
he
didnt
waste
an
instant
at
his
signal
the
chief
officer
appeared
the
two
men
held
a
quick
exchange
in
their
incomprehensible
language
and
either
the
chief
officer
had
been
alerted
previously
or
he
found
the
plan
feasible
because
he
showed
no
surprise
but
as
unemotional
as
he
was
he
couldnt
have
been
more
impeccably
emotionless
than
conseil
when
i
told
the
fine
lad
our
intention
of
pushing
on
to
the
south
pole
he
greeted
my
announcement
with
the
usual
as
master
wishes
and
i
had
to
be
content
with
that
as
for
ned
land
no
human
shoulders
ever
executed
a
higher
shrug
than
the
pair
belonging
to
our
canadian
honestly
sir
he
told
me
you
and
your
captain
nemo
i
pity
you
both
but
we
will
go
to
the
pole
mr
land
maybe
but
you
wont
come
back
and
ned
land
reentered
his
cabin
to
keep
from
doing
something
desperate
he
said
as
he
left
me
meanwhile
preparations
for
this
daring
attempt
were
getting
under
way
the
nautiluss
powerful
pumps
forced
air
down
into
the
tanks
and
stored
it
under
high
pressure
near
four
oclock
captain
nemo
informed
me
that
the
platform
hatches
were
about
to
be
closed
i
took
a
last
look
at
the
dense
ice
bank
we
were
going
to
conquer
the
weather
was
fair
the
skies
reasonably
clear
the
cold
quite
brisk
namely
12
degrees
centigrade
but
after
the
wind
had
lulled
this
temperature
didnt
seem
too
unbearable
equipped
with
picks
some
ten
men
climbed
onto
the
nautiluss
sides
and
cracked
loose
the
ice
around
the
ships
lower
plating
which
was
soon
set
free
this
operation
was
swiftly
executed
because
the
fresh
ice
was
still
thin
we
all
reentered
the
interior
the
main
ballast
tanks
were
filled
with
the
water
that
hadnt
yet
congealed
at
our
line
of
flotation
the
nautilus
submerged
without
delay
i
took
a
seat
in
the
lounge
with
conseil
through
the
open
window
we
stared
at
the
lower
strata
of
this
southernmost
ocean
the
thermometer
rose
again
the
needle
on
the
pressure
gauge
swerved
over
its
dial
about
300
meters
down
just
as
captain
nemo
had
predicted
we
cruised
beneath
the
undulating
surface
of
the
ice
bank
but
the
nautilus
sank
deeper
still
it
reached
a
depth
of
800
meters
at
the
surface
this
water
gave
a
temperature
of
12
degrees
centigrade
but
now
it
gave
no
more
than
10
degrees
two
degrees
had
already
been
gained
thanks
to
its
heating
equipment
the
nautiluss
temperature
needless
to
say
stayed
at
a
much
higher
degree
every
maneuver
was
accomplished
with
extraordinary
precision
with
all
due
respect
to
master
conseil
told
me
well
pass
it
by
i
fully
expect
to
i
replied
in
a
tone
of
deep
conviction
now
in
open
water
the
nautilus
took
a
direct
course
to
the
pole
without
veering
from
the
52nd
meridian
from
67
degrees
30
to
90
degrees
twentytwo
and
a
half
degrees
of
latitude
were
left
to
cross
in
other
words
slightly
more
than
500
leagues
the
nautilus
adopted
an
average
speed
of
twentysix
miles
per
hour
the
speed
of
an
express
train
if
it
kept
up
this
pace
forty
hours
would
do
it
for
reaching
the
pole
for
part
of
the
night
the
novelty
of
our
circumstances
kept
conseil
and
me
at
the
lounge
window
the
sea
was
lit
by
our
beacons
electric
rays
but
the
depths
were
deserted
fish
didnt
linger
in
these
imprisoned
waters
here
they
found
merely
a
passageway
for
going
from
the
antarctic
ocean
to
open
sea
at
the
pole
our
progress
was
swift
you
could
feel
it
in
the
vibrations
of
the
long
steel
hull
near
two
oclock
in
the
morning
i
went
to
snatch
a
few
hours
of
sleep
conseil
did
likewise
i
didnt
encounter
captain
nemo
while
going
down
the
gangways
i
assumed
that
he
was
keeping
to
the
pilothouse
the
next
day
march
19
at
five
oclock
in
the
morning
i
was
back
at
my
post
in
the
lounge
the
electric
log
indicated
that
the
nautilus
had
reduced
speed
by
then
it
was
rising
to
the
surface
but
cautiously
while
slowly
emptying
its
ballast
tanks
my
heart
was
pounding
would
we
emerge
into
the
open
and
find
the
polar
air
again
no
a
jolt
told
me
that
the
nautilus
had
bumped
the
underbelly
of
the
ice
bank
still
quite
thick
to
judge
from
the
hollowness
of
the
accompanying
noise
indeed
we
had
struck
bottom
to
use
nautical
terminology
but
in
the
opposite
direction
and
at
a
depth
of
3000
feet
that
gave
us
4000
feet
of
ice
overhead
of
which
1000
feet
emerged
above
water
so
the
ice
bank
was
higher
here
than
we
had
found
it
on
the
outskirts
a
circumstance
less
than
encouraging
several
times
that
day
the
nautilus
repeated
the
same
experiment
and
always
it
bumped
against
this
surface
that
formed
a
ceiling
above
it
at
certain
moments
the
ship
encountered
ice
at
a
depth
of
900
meters
denoting
a
thickness
of
1200
meters
of
which
300
meters
rose
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
this
height
had
tripled
since
the
moment
the
nautilus
had
dived
beneath
the
waves
i
meticulously
noted
these
different
depths
obtaining
the
underwater
profile
of
this
upsidedown
mountain
chain
that
stretched
beneath
the
sea
by
evening
there
was
still
no
improvement
in
our
situation
the
ice
stayed
between
400
and
500
meters
deep
it
was
obviously
shrinking
but
what
a
barrier
still
lay
between
us
and
the
surface
of
the
ocean
by
then
it
was
eight
oclock
the
air
inside
the
nautilus
should
have
been
renewed
four
hours
earlier
following
daily
practice
on
board
but
i
didnt
suffer
very
much
although
captain
nemo
hadnt
yet
made
demands
on
the
supplementary
oxygen
in
his
air
tanks
that
night
my
sleep
was
fitful
hope
and
fear
besieged
me
by
turns
i
got
up
several
times
the
nautilus
continued
groping
near
three
oclock
in
the
morning
i
observed
that
we
encountered
the
ice
banks
underbelly
at
a
depth
of
only
fifty
meters
so
only
150
feet
separated
us
from
the
surface
of
the
water
little
by
little
the
ice
bank
was
turning
into
an
ice
field
again
the
mountains
were
changing
back
into
plains
my
eyes
didnt
leave
the
pressure
gauge
we
kept
rising
on
a
diagonal
going
along
this
shiny
surface
that
sparkled
beneath
our
electric
rays
above
and
below
the
ice
bank
was
subsiding
in
long
gradients
mile
after
mile
it
was
growing
thinner
finally
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
on
that
memorable
day
of
march
19
the
lounge
door
opened
captain
nemo
appeared
open
sea
he
told
me
chapter
14
the
south
pole
i
rushed
up
onto
the
platform
yes
open
sea
barely
a
few
sparse
floes
some
moving
icebergs
a
sea
stretching
into
the
distance
hosts
of
birds
in
the
air
and
myriads
of
fish
under
the
waters
which
varied
from
intense
blue
to
olive
green
depending
on
the
depth
the
thermometer
marked
3
degrees
centigrade
it
was
as
if
a
comparative
springtime
had
been
locked
up
behind
that
ice
bank
whose
distant
masses
were
outlined
on
the
northern
horizon
are
we
at
the
pole
i
asked
the
captain
my
heart
pounding
ive
no
idea
he
answered
me
at
noon
well
fix
our
position
but
will
the
sun
show
through
this
mist
i
said
staring
at
the
grayish
sky
no
matter
how
faintly
it
shines
it
will
be
enough
for
me
the
captain
replied
to
the
south
ten
miles
from
the
nautilus
a
solitary
islet
rose
to
a
height
of
200
meters
we
proceeded
toward
it
but
cautiously
because
this
sea
could
have
been
strewn
with
reefs
in
an
hour
we
had
reached
the
islet
two
hours
later
we
had
completed
a
full
circle
around
it
it
measured
four
to
five
miles
in
circumference
a
narrow
channel
separated
it
from
a
considerable
shore
perhaps
a
continent
whose
limits
we
couldnt
see
the
existence
of
this
shore
seemed
to
bear
out
commander
maurys
hypotheses
in
essence
this
ingenious
american
has
noted
that
between
the
south
pole
and
the
60th
parallel
the
sea
is
covered
with
floating
ice
of
dimensions
much
greater
than
any
found
in
the
north
atlantic
from
this
fact
he
drew
the
conclusion
that
the
antarctic
circle
must
contain
considerable
shores
since
icebergs
cant
form
on
the
high
seas
but
only
along
coastlines
according
to
his
calculations
this
frozen
mass
enclosing
the
southernmost
pole
forms
a
vast
ice
cap
whose
width
must
reach
4000
kilometers
meanwhile
to
avoid
running
aground
the
nautilus
halted
three
cable
lengths
from
a
strand
crowned
by
superb
piles
of
rocks
the
skiff
was
launched
to
sea
two
crewmen
carrying
instruments
the
captain
conseil
and
i
were
on
board
it
was
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
i
hadnt
seen
ned
land
no
doubt
in
the
presence
of
the
south
pole
the
canadian
hated
having
to
eat
his
words
a
few
strokes
of
the
oar
brought
the
skiff
to
the
sand
where
it
ran
aground
just
as
conseil
was
about
to
jump
ashore
i
held
him
back
sir
i
told
captain
nemo
to
you
belongs
the
honor
of
first
setting
foot
on
this
shore
yes
sir
the
captain
replied
and
if
i
have
no
hesitation
in
treading
this
polar
soil
its
because
no
human
being
until
now
has
left
a
footprint
here
so
saying
he
leaped
lightly
onto
the
sand
his
heart
must
have
been
throbbing
with
intense
excitement
he
scaled
an
overhanging
rock
that
ended
in
a
small
promontory
and
there
mute
and
motionless
with
crossed
arms
and
blazing
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
laying
claim
to
these
southernmost
regions
after
spending
five
minutes
in
this
trance
he
turned
to
us
whenever
youre
ready
sir
he
called
to
me
i
got
out
conseil
at
my
heels
leaving
the
two
men
in
the
skiff
over
an
extensive
area
the
soil
consisted
of
that
igneous
gravel
called
tuff
reddish
in
color
as
if
made
from
crushed
bricks
the
ground
was
covered
with
slag
lava
flows
and
pumice
stones
its
volcanic
origin
was
unmistakable
in
certain
localities
thin
smoke
holes
gave
off
a
sulfurous
odor
showing
that
the
inner
fires
still
kept
their
wideranging
power
nevertheless
when
i
scaled
a
high
escarpment
i
could
see
no
volcanoes
within
a
radius
of
several
miles
in
these
antarctic
districts
as
is
well
known
sir
james
clark
ross
had
found
the
craters
of
mt
erebus
and
mt
terror
in
fully
active
condition
on
the
167th
meridian
at
latitude
77
degrees
32
the
vegetation
on
this
desolate
continent
struck
me
as
quite
limited
a
few
lichens
of
the
species
usnea
melanoxanthra
sprawled
over
the
black
rocks
the
whole
meager
flora
of
this
region
consisted
of
certain
microscopic
buds
rudimentary
diatoms
made
up
of
a
type
of
cell
positioned
between
two
quartzrich
shells
plus
long
purple
and
crimson
fucus
plants
buoyed
by
small
air
bladders
and
washed
up
on
the
coast
by
the
surf
the
beach
was
strewn
with
mollusks
small
mussels
limpets
smooth
heartshaped
cockles
and
especially
some
sea
butterflies
with
oblong
membranefilled
bodies
whose
heads
are
formed
from
two
rounded
lobes
i
also
saw
myriads
of
those
northernmost
sea
butterflies
three
centimeters
long
which
a
baleen
whale
can
swallow
by
the
thousands
in
one
gulp
the
open
waters
at
the
shoreline
were
alive
with
these
delightful
pteropods
true
butterflies
of
the
sea
among
other
zoophytes
present
in
these
shallows
there
were
a
few
coral
tree
forms
that
according
to
sir
james
clark
ross
live
in
these
antarctic
seas
at
depths
as
great
as
1000
meters
then
small
alcyon
coral
belonging
to
the
species
procellaria
pelagica
also
a
large
number
of
starfish
unique
to
these
climes
plus
some
feather
stars
spangling
the
sand
but
it
was
in
the
air
that
life
was
superabundant
there
various
species
of
birds
flew
and
fluttered
by
the
thousands
deafening
us
with
their
calls
crowding
the
rocks
other
fowl
watched
without
fear
as
we
passed
and
pressed
familiarly
against
our
feet
these
were
auks
as
agile
and
supple
in
water
where
they
are
sometimes
mistaken
for
fast
bonito
as
they
are
clumsy
and
heavy
on
land
they
uttered
outlandish
calls
and
participated
in
numerous
public
assemblies
that
featured
much
noise
but
little
action
among
other
fowl
i
noted
some
sheathbills
from
the
wadingbird
family
the
size
of
pigeons
white
in
color
the
beak
short
and
conical
the
eyes
framed
by
red
circles
conseil
laid
in
a
supply
of
them
because
when
theyre
properly
cooked
these
winged
creatures
make
a
pleasant
dish
in
the
air
there
passed
sooty
albatross
with
fourmeter
wingspans
birds
aptly
dubbed
vultures
of
the
ocean
also
gigantic
petrels
including
several
with
arching
wings
enthusiastic
eaters
of
seal
that
are
known
as
quebrantahuesos
and
cape
pigeons
a
sort
of
small
duck
the
tops
of
their
bodies
black
and
whitein
short
a
whole
series
of
petrels
some
whitish
with
wings
trimmed
in
brown
others
blue
and
exclusive
to
these
antarctic
seas
the
former
so
oily
i
told
conseil
that
inhabitants
of
the
faroe
islands
simply
fit
the
bird
with
a
wick
then
light
it
up
spanish
ospreys
ed
with
that
minor
addition
conseil
replied
these
fowl
would
make
perfect
lamps
after
this
we
should
insist
that
nature
equip
them
with
wicks
in
advance
half
a
mile
farther
on
the
ground
was
completely
riddled
with
penguin
nests
egglaying
burrows
from
which
numerous
birds
emerged
later
captain
nemo
had
hundreds
of
them
hunted
because
their
black
flesh
is
highly
edible
they
brayed
like
donkeys
the
size
of
a
goose
with
slatecolored
bodies
white
undersides
and
lemoncolored
neck
bands
these
animals
let
themselves
be
stoned
to
death
without
making
any
effort
to
get
away
meanwhile
the
mists
didnt
clear
and
by
eleven
oclock
the
sun
still
hadnt
made
an
appearance
its
absence
disturbed
me
without
it
no
sights
were
possible
then
how
could
we
tell
whether
we
had
reached
the
pole
when
i
rejoined
captain
nemo
i
found
him
leaning
silently
against
a
piece
of
rock
and
staring
at
the
sky
he
seemed
impatient
baffled
but
what
could
we
do
this
daring
and
powerful
man
couldnt
control
the
sun
as
he
did
the
sea
noon
arrived
without
the
orb
of
day
appearing
for
a
single
instant
you
couldnt
even
find
its
hiding
place
behind
the
curtain
of
mist
and
soon
this
mist
began
to
condense
into
snow
until
tomorrow
the
captain
said
simply
and
we
went
back
to
the
nautilus
amid
flurries
in
the
air
during
our
absence
the
nets
had
been
spread
and
i
observed
with
fascination
the
fish
just
hauled
on
board
the
antarctic
seas
serve
as
a
refuge
for
an
extremely
large
number
of
migratory
fish
that
flee
from
storms
in
the
subpolar
zones
in
truth
only
to
slide
down
the
gullets
of
porpoises
and
seals
i
noted
some
onedecimeter
southern
bullhead
a
species
of
whitish
cartilaginous
fish
overrun
with
bluish
gray
stripes
and
armed
with
stings
then
some
antarctic
rabbitfish
three
feet
long
the
body
very
slender
the
skin
a
smooth
silver
white
the
head
rounded
the
topside
furnished
with
three
fins
the
snout
ending
in
a
trunk
that
curved
back
toward
the
mouth
i
sampled
its
flesh
but
found
it
tasteless
despite
conseils
views
which
were
largely
approving
the
blizzard
lasted
until
the
next
day
it
was
impossible
to
stay
on
the
platform
from
the
lounge
where
i
was
writing
up
the
incidents
of
this
excursion
to
the
polar
continent
i
could
hear
the
calls
of
petrel
and
albatross
cavorting
in
the
midst
of
the
turmoil
the
nautilus
didnt
stay
idle
and
cruising
along
the
coast
it
advanced
some
ten
miles
farther
south
amid
the
half
light
left
by
the
sun
as
it
skimmed
the
edge
of
the
horizon
the
next
day
march
20
it
stopped
snowing
the
cold
was
a
little
more
brisk
the
thermometer
marked
2
degrees
centigrade
the
mist
had
cleared
and
on
that
day
i
hoped
our
noon
sights
could
be
accomplished
since
captain
nemo
hadnt
yet
appeared
only
conseil
and
i
were
taken
ashore
by
the
skiff
the
soils
nature
was
still
the
same
volcanic
traces
of
lava
slag
and
basaltic
rock
were
everywhere
but
i
couldnt
find
the
crater
that
had
vomited
them
up
there
as
yonder
myriads
of
birds
enlivened
this
part
of
the
polar
continent
but
they
had
to
share
their
dominion
with
huge
herds
of
marine
mammals
that
looked
at
us
with
gentle
eyes
these
were
seals
of
various
species
some
stretched
out
on
the
ground
others
lying
on
drifting
ice
floes
several
leaving
or
reentering
the
sea
having
never
dealt
with
man
they
didnt
run
off
at
our
approach
and
i
counted
enough
of
them
thereabouts
to
provision
a
couple
hundred
ships
ye
gods
conseil
said
its
fortunate
that
ned
land
didnt
come
with
us
why
so
conseil
because
that
madcap
hunter
would
kill
every
animal
here
every
animal
may
be
overstating
it
but
in
truth
i
doubt
we
could
keep
our
canadian
friend
from
harpooning
some
of
these
magnificent
cetaceans
which
would
be
an
affront
to
captain
nemo
since
he
hates
to
slay
harmless
beasts
needlessly
hes
right
certainly
conseil
but
tell
me
havent
you
finished
classifying
these
superb
specimens
of
marine
fauna
master
is
well
aware
conseil
replied
that
im
not
seasoned
in
practical
application
when
master
has
told
me
these
animals
names



theyre
seals
and
walruses
two
genera
our
scholarly
conseil
hastened
to
say
that
belong
to
the
family
pinnipedia
order
carnivora
group
unguiculata
subclass
monodelphia
class
mammalia
branch
vertebrata
very
nice
conseil
i
replied
but
these
two
genera
of
seals
and
walruses
are
each
divided
into
species
and
if
im
not
mistaken
we
now
have
a
chance
to
actually
look
at
them
lets
it
was
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
we
had
four
hours
to
ourselves
before
the
sun
could
be
productively
observed
i
guided
our
steps
toward
a
huge
bay
that
made
a
crescentshaped
incision
in
the
granite
cliffs
along
the
beach
there
all
about
us
i
swear
that
the
shores
and
ice
floes
were
crowded
with
marine
mammals
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
and
i
involuntarily
looked
around
for
old
proteus
that
mythological
shepherd
who
guarded
king
neptunes
immense
flocks
to
be
specific
these
were
seals
they
formed
distinct
maleandfemale
groups
the
father
watching
over
his
family
the
mother
suckling
her
little
ones
the
stronger
youngsters
emancipated
a
few
paces
away
when
these
mammals
wanted
to
relocate
they
moved
in
little
jumps
made
by
contracting
their
bodies
clumsily
helped
by
their
imperfectly
developed
flippers
which
as
with
their
manatee
relatives
form
actual
forearms
in
the
water
their
ideal
element
i
must
say
these
animals
swim
wonderfully
thanks
to
their
flexible
backbones
narrow
pelvises
closecropped
hair
and
webbed
feet
resting
on
shore
they
assumed
extremely
graceful
positions
consequently
their
gentle
features
their
sensitive
expressions
equal
to
those
of
the
loveliest
women
their
soft
limpid
eyes
their
charming
poses
led
the
ancients
to
glorify
them
by
metamorphosing
the
males
into
sea
gods
and
the
females
into
mermaids
i
drew
conseils
attention
to
the
considerable
growth
of
the
cerebral
lobes
found
in
these
intelligent
cetaceans
no
mammal
except
man
has
more
abundant
cerebral
matter
accordingly
seals
are
quite
capable
of
being
educated
they
make
good
pets
and
together
with
certain
other
naturalists
i
think
these
animals
can
be
properly
trained
to
perform
yeoman
service
as
hunting
dogs
for
fishermen
most
of
these
seals
were
sleeping
on
the
rocks
or
the
sand
among
those
properly
termed
sealswhich
have
no
external
ears
unlike
sea
lions
whose
ears
protrudei
observed
several
varieties
of
the
species
stenorhynchus
three
meters
long
with
white
hair
bulldog
heads
and
armed
with
ten
teeth
in
each
jaw
four
incisors
in
both
the
upper
and
lower
plus
two
big
canines
shaped
like
the
fleurdelis
among
them
slithered
some
sea
elephants
a
type
of
seal
with
a
short
flexible
trunk
these
are
the
giants
of
the
species
with
a
circumference
of
twenty
feet
and
a
length
of
ten
meters
they
didnt
move
as
we
approached
are
these
animals
dangerous
conseil
asked
me
only
if
theyre
attacked
i
replied
but
when
these
giant
seals
defend
their
little
ones
their
fury
is
dreadful
and
it
isnt
rare
for
them
to
smash
a
fishermans
longboat
to
bits
theyre
within
their
rights
conseil
answered
i
dont
say
nay
two
miles
farther
on
we
were
stopped
by
a
promontory
that
screened
the
bay
from
southerly
winds
it
dropped
straight
down
to
the
sea
and
surf
foamed
against
it
from
beyond
this
ridge
there
came
fearsome
bellows
such
as
a
herd
of
cattle
might
produce
gracious
conseil
put
in
a
choir
of
bulls
no
i
said
a
choir
of
walruses
are
they
fighting
with
each
other
either
fighting
or
playing
with
all
due
respect
to
master
this
we
must
see
then
see
it
we
must
conseil
and
there
we
were
climbing
these
blackish
rocks
amid
sudden
landslides
and
over
stones
slippery
with
ice
more
than
once
i
took
a
tumble
at
the
expense
of
my
backside
conseil
more
cautious
or
more
stable
barely
faltered
and
would
help
me
up
saying
if
masters
legs
would
kindly
adopt
a
wider
stance
master
will
keep
his
balance
arriving
at
the
topmost
ridge
of
this
promontory
i
could
see
vast
white
plains
covered
with
walruses
these
animals
were
playing
among
themselves
they
were
howling
not
in
anger
but
in
glee
walruses
resemble
seals
in
the
shape
of
their
bodies
and
the
arrangement
of
their
limbs
but
their
lower
jaws
lack
canines
and
incisors
and
as
for
their
upper
canines
they
consist
of
two
tusks
eighty
centimeters
long
with
a
circumference
of
thirtythree
centimeters
at
the
socket
made
of
solid
ivory
without
striations
harder
than
elephant
tusks
and
less
prone
to
yellowing
these
teeth
are
in
great
demand
accordingly
walruses
are
the
victims
of
a
mindless
hunting
that
soon
will
destroy
them
all
since
their
hunters
indiscriminately
slaughter
pregnant
females
and
youngsters
and
over
4000
individuals
are
destroyed
annually
passing
near
these
unusual
animals
i
could
examine
them
at
my
leisure
since
they
didnt
stir
their
hides
were
rough
and
heavy
a
tan
color
leaning
toward
a
reddish
brown
their
coats
were
short
and
less
than
abundant
some
were
four
meters
long
more
tranquil
and
less
fearful
than
their
northern
relatives
they
posted
no
sentinels
on
guard
duty
at
the
approaches
to
their
campsite
after
examining
this
community
of
walruses
i
decided
to
return
in
my
tracks
it
was
eleven
oclock
and
if
captain
nemo
found
conditions
favorable
for
taking
his
sights
i
wanted
to
be
present
at
the
operation
but
i
held
no
hopes
that
the
sun
would
make
an
appearance
that
day
it
was
hidden
from
our
eyes
by
clouds
squeezed
together
on
the
horizon
apparently
the
jealous
orb
didnt
want
to
reveal
this
inaccessible
spot
on
the
globe
to
any
human
being
yet
i
decided
to
return
to
the
nautilus
we
went
along
a
steep
narrow
path
that
ran
over
the
cliffs
summit
by
1130
we
had
arrived
at
our
landing
place
the
beached
skiff
had
brought
the
captain
ashore
i
spotted
him
standing
on
a
chunk
of
basalt
his
instruments
were
beside
him
his
eyes
were
focused
on
the
northern
horizon
along
which
the
sun
was
sweeping
in
its
extended
arc
i
found
a
place
near
him
and
waited
without
speaking
noon
arrived
and
just
as
on
the
day
before
the
sun
didnt
put
in
an
appearance
it
was
sheer
bad
luck
our
noon
sights
were
still
lacking
if
we
couldnt
obtain
them
tomorrow
we
would
finally
have
to
give
up
any
hope
of
fixing
our
position
in
essence
it
was
precisely
march
20
tomorrow
the
21st
was
the
day
of
the
equinox
the
sun
would
disappear
below
the
horizon
for
six
months
not
counting
refraction
and
after
its
disappearance
the
long
polar
night
would
begin
following
the
september
equinox
the
sun
had
emerged
above
the
northerly
horizon
rising
in
long
spirals
until
december
21
at
that
time
the
summer
solstice
of
these
southernmost
districts
the
sun
had
started
back
down
and
tomorrow
it
would
cast
its
last
rays
i
shared
my
thoughts
and
fears
with
captain
nemo
youre
right
professor
aronnax
he
told
me
if
i
cant
take
the
suns
altitude
tomorrow
i
wont
be
able
to
try
again
for
another
six
months
but
precisely
because
sailors
luck
has
led
me
into
these
seas
on
march
21
it
will
be
easy
to
get
our
bearings
if
the
noonday
sun
does
appear
before
our
eyes
why
easy
captain
because
when
the
orb
of
day
sweeps
in
such
long
spirals
its
difficult
to
measure
its
exact
altitude
above
the
horizon
and
our
instruments
are
open
to
committing
serious
errors
then
what
can
you
do
i
use
only
my
chronometer
captain
nemo
answered
me
at
noon
tomorrow
march
21
if
after
accounting
for
refraction
the
suns
disk
is
cut
exactly
in
half
by
the
northern
horizon
that
will
mean
im
at
the
south
pole
right
i
said
nevertheless
it
isnt
mathematically
exact
proof
because
the
equinox
neednt
fall
precisely
at
noon
no
doubt
sir
but
the
error
will
be
under
100
meters
and
thats
close
enough
for
us
until
tomorrow
then
captain
nemo
went
back
on
board
conseil
and
i
stayed
behind
until
five
oclock
surveying
the
beach
observing
and
studying
the
only
unusual
object
i
picked
up
was
an
auks
egg
of
remarkable
size
for
which
a
collector
would
have
paid
more
than
1000
francs
its
creamcolored
tint
plus
the
streaks
and
markings
that
decorated
it
like
so
many
hieroglyphics
made
it
a
rare
trinket
i
placed
it
in
conseils
hands
and
holding
it
like
precious
porcelain
from
china
that
cautious
surefooted
lad
got
it
back
to
the
nautilus
in
one
piece
there
i
put
this
rare
egg
inside
one
of
the
glass
cases
in
the
museum
i
ate
supper
feasting
with
appetite
on
an
excellent
piece
of
seal
liver
whose
flavor
reminded
me
of
pork
then
i
went
to
bed
but
not
without
praying
like
a
good
hindu
for
the
favors
of
the
radiant
orb
the
next
day
march
21
bright
and
early
at
five
oclock
in
the
morning
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
i
found
captain
nemo
there
the
weather
is
clearing
a
bit
he
told
me
i
have
high
hopes
after
breakfast
well
make
our
way
ashore
and
choose
an
observation
post
this
issue
settled
i
went
to
find
ned
land
i
wanted
to
take
him
with
me
the
obstinate
canadian
refused
and
i
could
clearly
see
that
his
tightlipped
mood
and
his
bad
temper
were
growing
by
the
day
under
the
circumstances
i
ultimately
wasnt
sorry
that
he
refused
in
truth
there
were
too
many
seals
ashore
and
it
would
never
do
to
expose
this
impulsive
fisherman
to
such
temptations
breakfast
over
i
made
my
way
ashore
the
nautilus
had
gone
a
few
more
miles
during
the
night
it
lay
well
out
a
good
league
from
the
coast
which
was
crowned
by
a
sharp
peak
400
to
500
meters
high
in
addition
to
me
the
skiff
carried
captain
nemo
two
crewmen
and
the
instrumentsin
other
words
a
chronometer
a
spyglass
and
a
barometer
during
our
crossing
i
saw
numerous
baleen
whales
belonging
to
the
three
species
unique
to
these
southernmost
seas
the
bowhead
whale
or
right
whale
according
to
the
english
which
has
no
dorsal
fin
the
humpback
whale
from
the
genus
balaenoptera
in
other
words
winged
whales
beasts
with
wrinkled
bellies
and
huge
whitish
fins
that
genus
name
regardless
do
not
yet
form
wings
and
the
finback
whale
yellowish
brown
the
swiftest
of
all
cetaceans
this
powerful
animal
is
audible
from
far
away
when
it
sends
up
towering
spouts
of
air
and
steam
that
resemble
swirls
of
smoke
herds
of
these
different
mammals
were
playing
about
in
the
tranquil
waters
and
i
could
easily
see
that
this
antarctic
polar
basin
now
served
as
a
refuge
for
those
cetaceans
too
relentlessly
pursued
by
hunters
i
also
noted
long
whitish
strings
of
salps
a
type
of
mollusk
found
in
clusters
and
some
jellyfish
of
large
size
that
swayed
in
the
eddies
of
the
billows
by
nine
oclock
we
had
pulled
up
to
shore
the
sky
was
growing
brighter
clouds
were
fleeing
to
the
south
mists
were
rising
from
the
cold
surface
of
the
water
captain
nemo
headed
toward
the
peak
which
he
no
doubt
planned
to
make
his
observatory
it
was
an
arduous
climb
over
sharp
lava
and
pumice
stones
in
the
midst
of
air
often
reeking
with
sulfurous
fumes
from
the
smoke
holes
for
a
man
out
of
practice
at
treading
land
the
captain
scaled
the
steepest
slopes
with
a
supple
agility
i
couldnt
equal
and
which
would
have
been
envied
by
hunters
of
pyrenees
mountain
goats
it
took
us
two
hours
to
reach
the
summit
of
this
halfcrystal
halfbasalt
peak
from
there
our
eyes
scanned
a
vast
sea
which
scrawled
its
boundary
line
firmly
against
the
background
of
the
northern
sky
at
our
feet
dazzling
tracts
of
white
over
our
heads
a
pale
azure
clear
of
mists
north
of
us
the
suns
disk
like
a
ball
of
fire
already
cut
into
by
the
edge
of
the
horizon
from
the
heart
of
the
waters
jets
of
liquid
rising
like
hundreds
of
magnificent
bouquets
far
off
like
a
sleeping
cetacean
the
nautilus
behind
us
to
the
south
and
east
an
immense
shore
a
chaotic
heap
of
rocks
and
ice
whose
limits
we
couldnt
see
arriving
at
the
summit
of
this
peak
captain
nemo
carefully
determined
its
elevation
by
means
of
his
barometer
since
he
had
to
take
this
factor
into
account
in
his
noon
sights
at
1145
the
sun
by
then
seen
only
by
refraction
looked
like
a
golden
disk
dispersing
its
last
rays
over
this
deserted
continent
and
down
to
these
seas
not
yet
plowed
by
the
ships
of
man
captain
nemo
had
brought
a
spyglass
with
a
reticular
eyepiece
which
corrected
the
suns
refraction
by
means
of
a
mirror
and
he
used
it
to
observe
the
orb
sinking
little
by
little
along
a
very
extended
diagonal
that
reached
below
the
horizon
i
held
the
chronometer
my
heart
was
pounding
mightily
if
the
lower
half
of
the
suns
disk
disappeared
just
as
the
chronometer
said
noon
we
were
right
at
the
pole
noon
i
called

replied
in
a
solemn
voice
handing
me
the
spyglass
which
showed
the
orb
of
day
cut
into
two
exactly
equal
parts
by
the
horizon
i
stared
at
the
last
rays
wreathing
this
peak
while
shadows
were
gradually
climbing
its
gradients
just
then

accident
or
incident
the
next
day
march
22
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
preparations
for
departure
began
the
last
gleams
of
twilight
were
melting
into
night
the
cold
was
brisk
the
constellations
were
glittering
with
startling
intensity
the
wonderful
southern
cross
polar
star
of
the
antarctic
regions
twinkled
at
its
zenith
the
thermometer
marked
12
degrees
centigrade
and
a
fresh
breeze
left
a
sharp
nip
in
the
air
ice
floes
were
increasing
over
the
open
water
the
sea
was
starting
to
congeal
everywhere
numerous
blackish
patches
were
spreading
over
its
surface
announcing
the
imminent
formation
of
fresh
ice
obviously
this
southernmost
basin
froze
over
during
its
sixmonth
winter
and
became
utterly
inaccessible
what
happened
to
the
whales
during
this
period
no
doubt
they
went
beneath
the
ice
bank
to
find
more
feasible
seas
as
for
seals
and
walruses
they
were
accustomed
to
living
in
the
harshest
climates
and
stayed
on
in
these
icy
waterways
these
animals
know
by
instinct
how
to
gouge
holes
in
the
ice
fields
and
keep
them
continually
open
they
go
to
these
holes
to
breathe
once
the
birds
have
migrated
northward
to
escape
the
cold
these
marine
mammals
remain
as
sole
lords
of
the
polar
continent
meanwhile
the
ballast
tanks
filled
with
water
and
the
nautilus
sank
slowly
at
a
depth
of
1000
feet
it
stopped
its
propeller
churned
the
waves
and
it
headed
due
north
at
a
speed
of
fifteen
miles
per
hour
near
the
afternoon
it
was
already
cruising
under
the
immense
frozen
carapace
of
the
ice
bank
as
a
precaution
the
panels
in
the
lounge
stayed
closed
because
the
nautiluss
hull
could
run
afoul
of
some
submerged
block
of
ice
so
i
spent
the
day
putting
my
notes
into
final
form
my
mind
was
completely
wrapped
up
in
my
memories
of
the
pole
we
had
reached
that
inaccessible
spot
without
facing
exhaustion
or
danger
as
if
our
seagoing
passenger
carriage
had
glided
there
on
railroad
tracks
and
now
we
had
actually
started
our
return
journey
did
it
still
have
comparable
surprises
in
store
for
me
i
felt
sure
it
did
so
inexhaustible
is
this
series
of
underwater
wonders
as
it
was
in
the
five
and
a
half
months
since
fate
had
brought
us
on
board
we
had
cleared
14000
leagues
and
over
this
track
longer
than
the
earths
equator
so
many
fascinating
or
frightening
incidents
had
beguiled
our
voyage
that
hunting
trip
in
the
crespo
forests
our
running
aground
in
the
torres
strait
the
coral
cemetery
the
pearl
fisheries
of
ceylon
the
arabic
tunnel
the
fires
of
santorini
those
millions
in
the
bay
of
vigo
atlantis
the
south
pole
during
the
night
all
these
memories
crossed
over
from
one
dream
to
the
next
not
giving
my
brain
a
moments
rest
at
three
oclock
in
the
morning
i
was
awakened
by
a
violent
collision
i
sat
up
in
bed
listening
in
the
darkness
and
then
was
suddenly
hurled
into
the
middle
of
my
stateroom
apparently
the
nautilus
had
gone
aground
then
heeled
over
sharply
leaning
against
the
walls
i
dragged
myself
down
the
gangways
to
the
lounge
whose
ceiling
lights
were
on
the
furniture
had
been
knocked
over
fortunately
the
glass
cases
were
solidly
secured
at
the
base
and
had
stood
fast
since
we
were
no
longer
vertical
the
starboard
pictures
were
glued
to
the
tapestries
while
those
to
port
had
their
lower
edges
hanging
a
foot
away
from
the
wall
so
the
nautilus
was
lying
on
its
starboard
side
completely
stationary
to
boot
in
its
interior
i
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
muffled
voices
but
captain
nemo
didnt
appear
just
as
i
was
about
to
leave
the
lounge
ned
land
and
conseil
entered
what
happened
i
instantly
said
to
them
i
came
to
ask
master
that
conseil
replied
damnation
the
canadian
exclaimed
i
know
full
well
what
happened
the
nautilus
has
gone
aground
and
judging
from
the
way
its
listing
i
dont
think
itll
pull
through
like
that
first
time
in
the
torres
strait
but
i
asked
are
we
at
least
back
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
we
have
no
idea
conseil
replied
its
easy
to
find
out
i
answered
i
consulted
the
pressure
gauge
much
to
my
surprise
it
indicated
a
depth
of
360
meters
whats
the
meaning
of
this
i
exclaimed
we
must
confer
with
captain
nemo
conseil
said
but
where
do
we
find
him
ned
land
asked
follow
me
i
told
my
two
companions
we
left
the
lounge
nobody
in
the
library
nobody
by
the
central
companionway
or
the
crews
quarters
i
assumed
that
captain
nemo
was
stationed
in
the
pilothouse
best
to
wait
the
three
of
us
returned
to
the
lounge
ill
skip
over
the
canadians
complaints
he
had
good
grounds
for
an
outburst
i
didnt
answer
him
back
letting
him
blow
off
all
the
steam
he
wanted
we
had
been
left
to
ourselves
for
twenty
minutes
trying
to
detect
the
tiniest
noises
inside
the
nautilus
when
captain
nemo
entered
he
didnt
seem
to
see
us
his
facial
features
usually
so
emotionless
revealed
a
certain
uneasiness
he
studied
the
compass
and
pressure
gauge
in
silence
then
went
and
put
his
finger
on
the
world
map
at
a
spot
in
the
sector
depicting
the
southernmost
seas
i
hesitated
to
interrupt
him
but
some
moments
later
when
he
turned
to
me
i
threw
back
at
him
a
phrase
he
had
used
in
the
torres
strait
an
incident
captain
no
sir
he
replied
this
time
an
accident
serious
perhaps
is
there
any
immediate
danger
no
the
nautilus
has
run
aground
yes
and
this
accident
came
about




through
natures
unpredictability
not
mans
incapacity
no
errors
were
committed
in
our
maneuvers
nevertheless
we
cant
prevent
a
loss
of
balance
from
taking
its
toll
one
may
defy
human
laws
but
no
one
can
withstand
the
laws
of
nature
captain
nemo
had
picked
an
odd
time
to
philosophize
all
in
all
this
reply
told
me
nothing
may
i
learn
sir
i
asked
him
what
caused
this
accident
an
enormous
block
of
ice
an
entire
mountain
has
toppled
over
he
answered
me
when
an
iceberg
is
eroded
at
the
base
by
warmer
waters
or
by
repeated
collisions
its
center
of
gravity
rises
then
it
somersaults
it
turns
completely
upside
down
thats
what
happened
here
when
it
overturned
one
of
these
blocks
hit
the
nautilus
as
it
was
cruising
under
the
waters
sliding
under
our
hull
this
block
then
raised
us
with
irresistible
power
lifting
us
into
less
congested
strata
where
we
now
lie
on
our
side
but
cant
we
float
the
nautilus
clear
by
emptying
its
ballast
tanks
to
regain
our
balance
that
sir
is
being
done
right
now
you
can
hear
the
pumps
working
look
at
the
needle
on
the
pressure
gauge
it
indicates
that
the
nautilus
is
rising
but
this
block
of
ice
is
rising
with
us
and
until
some
obstacle
halts
its
upward
movement
our
position
wont
change
indeed
the
nautilus
kept
the
same
heel
to
starboard
no
doubt
it
would
straighten
up
once
the
block
came
to
a
halt
but
before
that
happened
who
knew
if
we
might
not
hit
the
underbelly
of
the
ice
bank
and
be
hideously
squeezed
between
two
frozen
surfaces
i
mused
on
all
the
consequences
of
this
situation
captain
nemo
didnt
stop
studying
the
pressure
gauge
since
the
toppling
of
this
iceberg
the
nautilus
had
risen
about
150
feet
but
it
still
stayed
at
the
same
angle
to
the
perpendicular
suddenly
a
slight
movement
could
be
felt
over
the
hull
obviously
the
nautilus
was
straightening
a
bit
objects
hanging
in
the
lounge
were
visibly
returning
to
their
normal
positions
the
walls
were
approaching
the
vertical
nobody
said
a
word
hearts
pounding
we
could
see
and
feel
the
ship
righting
itself
the
floor
was
becoming
horizontal
beneath
our
feet
ten
minutes
went
by
finally
were
upright
i
exclaimed
yes
captain
nemo
said
heading
to
the
lounge
door
but
will
we
float
off
i
asked
him
certainly
he
replied
since
the
ballast
tanks
arent
yet
empty
and
when
they
are
the
nautilus
must
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
captain
went
out
and
soon
i
saw
that
at
his
orders
the
nautilus
had
halted
its
upward
movement
in
fact
it
soon
would
have
hit
the
underbelly
of
the
ice
bank
but
it
had
stopped
in
time
and
was
floating
in
midwater
that
was
a
close
call
conseil
then
said
yes
we
could
have
been
crushed
between
these
masses
of
ice
or
at
least
imprisoned
between
them
and
then
with
no
way
to
renew
our
air
supply



yes
that
was
a
close
call
if
its
over
with
ned
land
muttered
i
was
unwilling
to
get
into
a
pointless
argument
with
the
canadian
and
didnt
reply
moreover
the
panels
opened
just
then
and
the
outside
light
burst
through
the
uncovered
windows
we
were
fully
afloat
as
i
have
said
but
on
both
sides
of
the
nautilus
about
ten
meters
away
there
rose
dazzling
walls
of
ice
there
also
were
walls
above
and
below
above
because
the
ice
banks
underbelly
spread
over
us
like
an
immense
ceiling
below
because
the
somersaulting
block
shifting
little
by
little
had
found
points
of
purchase
on
both
side
walls
and
had
gotten
jammed
between
them
the
nautilus
was
imprisoned
in
a
genuine
tunnel
of
ice
about
twenty
meters
wide
and
filled
with
quiet
water
so
the
ship
could
easily
exit
by
going
either
ahead
or
astern
sinking
a
few
hundred
meters
deeper
and
then
taking
an
open
passageway
beneath
the
ice
bank
the
ceiling
lights
were
off
yet
the
lounge
was
still
brightly
lit
this
was
due
to
the
reflecting
power
of
the
walls
of
ice
which
threw
the
beams
of
our
beacon
right
back
at
us
words
cannot
describe
the
effects
produced
by
our
galvanic
rays
on
these
huge
whimsically
sculpted
blocks
whose
every
angle
ridge
and
facet
gave
off
a
different
glow
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
veins
running
inside
the
ice
it
was
a
dazzling
mine
of
gems
in
particular
sapphires
and
emeralds
whose
jets
of
blue
and
green
crisscrossed
here
and
there
opaline
hues
of
infinite
subtlety
raced
among
sparks
of
light
that
were
like
so
many
fiery
diamonds
their
brilliance
more
than
any
eye
could
stand
the
power
of
our
beacon
was
increased
a
hundredfold
like
a
lamp
shining
through
the
biconvex
lenses
of
a
worldclass
lighthouse
how
beautiful
conseil
exclaimed
yes
i
said
its
a
wonderful
sight
isnt
it
ned
oh
damnation
yes
ned
land
shot
back
its
superb
im
furious
that
i
have
to
admit
it
nobody
has
ever
seen
the
like
but
this
sight
could
cost
us
dearly
and
in
all
honesty
i
think
were
looking
at
things
god
never
intended
for
human
eyes
ned
was
right
it
was
too
beautiful
all
at
once
a
yell
from
conseil
made
me
turn
around
what
is
it
i
asked
master
must
close
his
eyes
master
mustnt
look
with
that
conseil
clapped
his
hands
over
his
eyes
but
whats
wrong
my
boy
ive
been
dazzled
struck
blind
involuntarily
my
eyes
flew
to
the
window
but
i
couldnt
stand
the
fire
devouring
it
i
realized
what
had
happened
the
nautilus
had
just
started
off
at
great
speed
all
the
tranquil
glimmers
of
the
ice
walls
had
then
changed
into
blazing
streaks
the
sparkles
from
these
myriads
of
diamonds
were
merging
with
each
other
swept
along
by
its
propeller
the
nautilus
was
traveling
through
a
sheath
of
flashing
light
then
the
panels
in
the
lounge
closed
we
kept
our
hands
over
our
eyes
which
were
utterly
saturated
with
those
concentric
gleams
that
swirl
before
the
retina
when
sunlight
strikes
it
too
intensely
it
took
some
time
to
calm
our
troubled
vision
finally
we
lowered
our
hands
ye
gods
i
never
would
have
believed
it
conseil
said
and
i
still
dont
believe
it
the
canadian
shot
back
when
we
return
to
shore
jaded
from
all
these
natural
wonders
conseil
added
think
how
well
look
down
on
those
pitiful
land
masses
those
puny
works
of
man
no
the
civilized
world
wont
be
good
enough
for
us
such
words
from
the
lips
of
this
emotionless
flemish
boy
showed
that
our
enthusiasm
was
near
the
boiling
point
but
the
canadian
didnt
fail
to
throw
his
dram
of
cold
water
over
us
the
civilized
world
he
said
shaking
his
head
dont
worry
conseil
my
friend
were
never
going
back
to
that
world
by
this
point
it
was
five
oclock
in
the
morning
just
then
there
was
a
collision
in
the
nautiluss
bow
i
realized
that
its
spur
had
just
bumped
a
block
of
ice
it
must
have
been
a
faulty
maneuver
because
this
underwater
tunnel
was
obstructed
by
such
blocks
and
didnt
make
for
easy
navigating
so
i
had
assumed
that
captain
nemo
in
adjusting
his
course
would
go
around
each
obstacle
or
would
hug
the
walls
and
follow
the
windings
of
the
tunnel
in
either
case
our
forward
motion
wouldnt
receive
an
absolute
check
nevertheless
contrary
to
my
expectations
the
nautilus
definitely
began
to
move
backward
were
going
astern
conseil
said
yes
i
replied
apparently
the
tunnel
has
no
way
out
at
this
end
and
so




so
i
said
our
maneuvers
are
quite
simple
well
return
in
our
tracks
and
go
out
the
southern
opening
thats
all
as
i
spoke
i
tried
to
sound
more
confident
than
i
really
felt
meanwhile
the
nautilus
accelerated
its
backward
movement
and
running
with
propeller
in
reverse
it
swept
us
along
at
great
speed
thisll
mean
a
delay
ned
said
what
are
a
few
hours
more
or
less
so
long
as
we
get
out
yes
ned
land
repeated
so
long
as
we
get
out
i
strolled
for
a
little
while
from
the
lounge
into
the
library
my
companions
kept
their
seats
and
didnt
move
soon
i
threw
myself
down
on
a
couch
and
picked
up
a
book
which
my
eyes
skimmed
mechanically
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
conseil
approached
me
saying
is
it
deeply
fascinating
this
volume
master
is
reading
tremendously
fascinating
i
replied
i
believe
it
master
is
reading
his
own
book
my
own
book
indeed
my
hands
were
holding
my
own
work
on
the
great
ocean
depths
i
hadnt
even
suspected
i
closed
the
book
and
resumed
my
strolling
ned
and
conseil
stood
up
to
leave
stay
here
my
friends
i
said
stopping
them
lets
stay
together
until
were
out
of
this
blind
alley
as
master
wishes
conseil
replied
the
hours
passed
i
often
studied
the
instruments
hanging
on
the
lounge
wall
the
pressure
gauge
indicated
that
the
nautilus
stayed
at
a
constant
depth
of
300
meters
the
compass
that
it
kept
heading
south
the
log
that
it
was
traveling
at
a
speed
of
twenty
miles
per
hour
an
excessive
speed
in
such
a
cramped
area
but
captain
nemo
knew
that
by
this
point
there
was
no
such
thing
as
too
fast
since
minutes
were
now
worth
centuries
at
825
a
second
collision
took
place
this
time
astern
i
grew
pale
my
companions
came
over
i
clutched
conseils
hand
our
eyes
questioned
each
other
and
more
directly
than
if
our
thoughts
had
been
translated
into
words
just
then
the
captain
entered
the
lounge
i
went
to
him
our
path
is
barred
to
the
south
i
asked
him
yes
sir
when
it
overturned
that
iceberg
closed
off

shortage
of
air
consequently
above
below
and
around
the
nautilus
there
were
impenetrable
frozen
walls
we
were
the
ice
banks
prisoners
the
canadian
banged
a
table
with
his
fearsome
fist
conseil
kept
still
i
stared
at
the
captain
his
face
had
resumed
its
usual
emotionlessness
he
crossed
his
arms
he
pondered
the
nautilus
did
not
stir
the
captain
then
broke
into
speech
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
calm
voice
there
are
two
ways
of
dying
under
the
conditions
in
which
were
placed
this
inexplicable
individual
acted
like
a
mathematics
professor
working
out
a
problem
for
his
pupils
the
first
way
he
went
on
is
death
by
crushing
the
second
is
death
by
asphyxiation
i
dont
mention
the
possibility
of
death
by
starvation
because
the
nautiluss
provisions
will
certainly
last
longer
than
we
will
therefore
lets
concentrate
on
our
chances
of
being
crushed
or
asphyxiated
as
for
asphyxiation
captain
i
replied
that
isnt
a
cause
for
alarm
because
the
air
tanks
are
full
true
captain
nemo
went
on
but
theyll
supply
air
for
only
two
days
now
then
weve
been
buried
beneath
the
waters
for
thirtysix
hours
and
the
nautiluss
heavy
atmosphere
already
needs
renewing
in
another
fortyeight
hours
our
reserve
air
will
be
used
up
well
then
captain
lets
free
ourselves
within
fortyeight
hours
well
try
to
at
least
by
cutting
through
one
of
these
walls
surrounding
us
which
one
i
asked
borings
will
tell
us
that
im
going
to
ground
the
nautilus
on
the
lower
shelf
then
my
men
will
put
on
their
diving
suits
and
attack
the
thinnest
of
these
ice
walls
can
the
panels
in
the
lounge
be
left
open
without
ill
effect
were
no
longer
in
motion
captain
nemo
went
out
hissing
sounds
soon
told
me
that
water
was
being
admitted
into
the
ballast
tanks
the
nautilus
slowly
settled
and
rested
on
the
icy
bottom
at
a
depth
of
350
meters
the
depth
at
which
the
lower
shelf
of
ice
lay
submerged
my
friends
i
said
were
in
a
serious
predicament
but
im
counting
on
your
courage
and
energy
sir
the
canadian
replied
this
is
no
time
to
bore
you
with
my
complaints
im
ready
to
do
anything
i
can
for
the
common
good
excellent
ned
i
said
extending
my
hand
to
the
canadian
i
might
add
he
went
on
that
im
as
handy
with
a
pick
as
a
harpoon
if
i
can
be
helpful
to
the
captain
he
can
use
me
any
way
he
wants
he
wont
turn
down
your
assistance
come
along
ned
i
led
the
canadian
to
the
room
where
the
nautiluss
men
were
putting
on
their
diving
suits
i
informed
the
captain
of
neds
proposition
which
was
promptly
accepted
the
canadian
got
into
his
underwater
costume
and
was
ready
as
soon
as
his
fellow
workers
each
of
them
carried
on
his
back
a
rouquayrol
device
that
the
air
tanks
had
supplied
with
a
generous
allowance
of
fresh
oxygen
a
considerable
but
necessary
drain
on
the
nautiluss
reserves
as
for
the
ruhmkorff
lamps
they
were
unnecessary
in
the
midst
of
these
brilliant
waters
saturated
with
our
electric
rays
after
ned
was
dressed
i
reentered
the
lounge
whose
windows
had
been
uncovered
stationed
next
to
conseil
i
examined
the
strata
surrounding
and
supporting
the
nautilus
some
moments
later
we
saw
a
dozen
crewmen
set
foot
on
the
shelf
of
ice
among
them
ned
land
easily
recognized
by
his
tall
figure
captain
nemo
was
with
them
before
digging
into
the
ice
the
captain
had
to
obtain
borings
to
insure
working
in
the
best
direction
long
bores
were
driven
into
the
side
walls
but
after
fifteen
meters
the
instruments
were
still
impeded
by
the
thickness
of
those
walls
it
was
futile
to
attack
the
ceiling
since
that
surface
was
the
ice
bank
itself
more
than
400
meters
high
captain
nemo
then
bored
into
the
lower
surface
there
we
were
separated
from
the
sea
by
a
tenmeter
barrier
thats
how
thick
the
iceberg
was
from
this
point
on
it
was
an
issue
of
cutting
out
a
piece
equal
in
surface
area
to
the
nautiluss
waterline
this
meant
detaching
about
6500
cubic
meters
to
dig
a
hole
through
which
the
ship
could
descend
below
this
tract
of
ice
work
began
immediately
and
was
carried
on
with
tireless
tenacity
instead
of
digging
all
around
the
nautilus
which
would
have
entailed
even
greater
difficulties
captain
nemo
had
an
immense
trench
outlined
on
the
ice
eight
meters
from
our
port
quarter
then
his
men
simultaneously
staked
it
off
at
several
points
around
its
circumference
soon
their
picks
were
vigorously
attacking
this
compact
matter
and
huge
chunks
were
loosened
from
its
mass
these
chunks
weighed
less
than
the
water
and
by
an
unusual
effect
of
specific
gravity
each
chunk
took
wing
as
it
were
to
the
roof
of
the
tunnel
which
thickened
above
by
as
much
as
it
diminished
below
but
this
hardly
mattered
so
long
as
the
lower
surface
kept
growing
thinner
after
two
hours
of
energetic
work
ned
land
reentered
exhausted
he
and
his
companions
were
replaced
by
new
workmen
including
conseil
and
me
the
nautiluss
chief
officer
supervised
us
the
water
struck
me
as
unusually
cold
but
i
warmed
up
promptly
while
wielding
my
pick
my
movements
were
quite
free
although
they
were
executed
under
a
pressure
of
thirty
atmospheres
after
two
hours
of
work
reentering
to
snatch
some
food
and
rest
i
found
a
noticeable
difference
between
the
clean
elastic
fluid
supplied
me
by
the
rouquayrol
device
and
the
nautiluss
atmosphere
which
was
already
charged
with
carbon
dioxide
the
air
hadnt
been
renewed
in
fortyeight
hours
and
its
lifegiving
qualities
were
considerably
weakened
meanwhile
after
twelve
hours
had
gone
by
we
had
removed
from
the
outlined
surface
area
a
slice
of
ice
only
one
meter
thick
hence
about
600
cubic
meters
assuming
the
same
work
would
be
accomplished
every
twelve
hours
it
would
still
take
five
nights
and
four
days
to
see
the
undertaking
through
to
completion
five
nights
and
four
days
i
told
my
companions
and
we
have
oxygen
in
the
air
tanks
for
only
two
days
without
taking
into
account
ned
answered
that
once
were
out
of
this
damned
prison
well
still
be
cooped
up
beneath
the
ice
bank
without
any
possible
contact
with
the
open
air
an
apt
remark
for
who
could
predict
the
minimum
time
we
would
need
to
free
ourselves
before
the
nautilus
could
return
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
couldnt
we
all
die
of
asphyxiation
were
this
ship
and
everyone
on
board
doomed
to
perish
in
this
tomb
of
ice
it
was
a
dreadful
state
of
affairs
but
we
faced
it
headon
each
one
of
us
determined
to
do
his
duty
to
the
end
during
the
night
in
line
with
my
forecasts
a
new
onemeter
slice
was
removed
from
this
immense
socket
but
in
the
morning
wearing
my
diving
suit
i
was
crossing
through
the
liquid
mass
in
a
temperature
of
6
degrees
to
7
degrees
centigrade
when
i
noted
that
little
by
little
the
side
walls
were
closing
in
on
each
other
the
liquid
strata
farthest
from
the
trench
not
warmed
by
the
movements
of
workmen
and
tools
were
showing
a
tendency
to
solidify
in
the
face
of
this
imminent
new
danger
what
would
happen
to
our
chances
for
salvation
and
how
could
we
prevent
this
liquid
medium
from
solidifying
then
cracking
the
nautiluss
hull
like
glass
i
didnt
tell
my
two
companions
about
this
new
danger
there
was
no
point
in
dampening
the
energy
they
were
putting
into
our
arduous
rescue
work
but
when
i
returned
on
board
i
mentioned
this
serious
complication
to
captain
nemo
i
know
he
told
me
in
that
calm
tone
the
most
dreadful
outlook
couldnt
change
its
one
more
danger
but
i
dont
know
any
way
of
warding
it
off
our
sole
chance
for
salvation
is
to
work
faster
than
the
water
solidifies
weve
got
to
get
there
first
thats
all
get
there
first
by
then
i
should
have
been
used
to
this
type
of
talk
for
several
hours
that
day
i
wielded
my
pick
doggedly
the
work
kept
me
going
besides
working
meant
leaving
the
nautilus
which
meant
breathing
the
clean
oxygen
drawn
from
the
air
tanks
and
supplied
by
our
equipment
which
meant
leaving
the
thin
foul
air
behind
near
evening
one
more
meter
had
been
dug
from
the
trench
when
i
returned
on
board
i
was
wellnigh
asphyxiated
by
the
carbon
dioxide
saturating
the
air
oh
if
only
we
had
the
chemical
methods
that
would
enable
us
to
drive
out
this
noxious
gas
there
was
no
lack
of
oxygen
all
this
water
contained
a
considerable
amount
and
after
it
was
decomposed
by
our
powerful
batteries
this
lifegiving
elastic
fluid
could
have
been
restored
to
us
i
had
thought
it
all
out
but
to
no
avail
because
the
carbon
dioxide
produced
by
our
breathing
permeated
every
part
of
the
ship
to
absorb
it
we
would
need
to
fill
containers
with
potassium
hydroxide
and
shake
them
continually
but
this
substance
was
missing
on
board
and
nothing
else
could
replace
it
that
evening
captain
nemo
was
forced
to
open
the
spigots
of
his
air
tanks
and
shoot
a
few
spouts
of
fresh
oxygen
through
the
nautiluss
interior
without
this
precaution
we
wouldnt
have
awakened
the
following
morning
the
next
day
march
26
i
returned
to
my
miners
trade
working
to
remove
the
fifth
meter
the
ice
banks
side
walls
and
underbelly
had
visibly
thickened
obviously
they
would
come
together
before
the
nautilus
could
break
free
for
an
instant
i
was
gripped
by
despair
my
pick
nearly
slipped
from
my
hands
what
was
the
point
of
this
digging
if
i
was
to
die
smothered
and
crushed
by
this
water
turning
to
stone
a
torture
undreamed
of
by
even
the
wildest
savages
i
felt
like
i
was
lying
in
the
jaws
of
a
fearsome
monster
jaws
irresistibly
closing
supervising
our
work
working
himself
captain
nemo
passed
near
me
just
then
i
touched
him
with
my
hand
and
pointed
to
the
walls
of
our
prison
the
starboard
wall
had
moved
forward
to
a
point
less
than
four
meters
from
the
nautiluss
hull
the
captain
understood
and
gave
me
a
signal
to
follow
him
we
returned
on
board
my
diving
suit
removed
i
went
with
him
to
the
lounge
professor
aronnax
he
told
me
this
calls
for
heroic
measures
or
well
be
sealed
up
in
this
solidified
water
as
if
it
were
cement
yes
i
said
but
what
can
we
do
oh
he
exclaimed
if
only
my
nautilus
were
strong
enough
to
stand
that
much
pressure
without
being
crushed
well
i
asked
not
catching
the
captains
meaning
dont
you
understand
he
went
on
that
the
congealing
of
this
water
could
come
to
our
rescue
dont
you
see
that
by
solidifying
it
could
burst
these
tracts
of
ice
imprisoning
us
just
as
its
freezing
can
burst
the
hardest
stones
arent
you
aware
that
this
force
could
be
the
instrument
of
our
salvation
rather
than
our
destruction
yes
captain
maybe
so
but
whatever
resistance
to
crushing
the
nautilus
may
have
it
still
couldnt
stand
such
dreadful
pressures
and
it
would
be
squashed
as
flat
as
a
piece
of
sheet
iron
i
know
it
sir
so
we
cant
rely
on
nature
to
rescue
us
only
our
own
efforts
we
must
counteract
this
solidification
we
must
hold
it
in
check
not
only
are
the
side
walls
closing
in
but
there
arent
ten
feet
of
water
ahead
or
astern
of
the
nautilus
all
around
us
this
freeze
is
gaining
fast
how
long
i
asked
will
the
oxygen
in
the
air
tanks
enable
us
to
breathe
on
board
the
captain
looked
me
straight
in
the
eye
after
tomorrow
he
said
the
air
tanks
will
be
empty
i
broke
out
in
a
cold
sweat
but
why
should
i
have
been
startled
by
this
reply
on
march
22
the
nautilus
had
dived
under
the
open
waters
at
the
pole
it
was
now
the
26th
we
had
lived
off
the
ships
stores
for
five
days
and
all
remaining
breathable
air
had
to
be
saved
for
the
workmen
even
today
as
i
write
these
lines
my
sensations
are
so
intense
that
an
involuntary
terror
sweeps
over
me
and
my
lungs
still
seem
short
of
air
meanwhile
motionless
and
silent
captain
nemo
stood
lost
in
thought
an
idea
visibly
crossed
his
mind
but
he
seemed
to
brush
it
aside
he
told
himself
no
at
last
these
words
escaped
his
lips
boiling
water
he
muttered
boiling
water
i
exclaimed
yes
sir
were
shut
up
in
a
relatively
confined
area
if
the
nautiluss
pumps
continually
injected
streams
of
boiling
water
into
this
space
wouldnt
that
raise
its
temperature
and
delay
its
freezing
its
worth
trying
i
said
resolutely
so
lets
try
it
professor
by
then
the
thermometer
gave
7
degrees
centigrade
outside
captain
nemo
led
me
to
the
galley
where
a
huge
distilling
mechanism
was
at
work
supplying
drinking
water
via
evaporation
the
mechanism
was
loaded
with
water
and
the
full
electric
heat
of
our
batteries
was
thrown
into
coils
awash
in
liquid
in
a
few
minutes
the
water
reached
100
degrees
centigrade
it
was
sent
to
the
pumps
while
new
water
replaced
it
in
the
process
the
heat
generated
by
our
batteries
was
so
intense
that
after
simply
going
through
the
mechanism
water
drawn
cold
from
the
sea
arrived
boiling
hot
at
the
body
of
the
pump
the
steaming
water
was
injected
into
the
icy
water
outside
and
after
three
hours
had
passed
the
thermometer
gave
the
exterior
temperature
as
6
degrees
centigrade
that
was
one
degree
gained
two
hours
later
the
thermometer
gave
only
4
degrees
after
i
monitored
the
operations
progress
doublechecking
it
with
many
inspections
i
told
the
captain
its
working
i
think
so
he
answered
me
weve
escaped
being
crushed
now
we
have
only
asphyxiation
to
fear
during
the
night
the
water
temperature
rose
to
1
degrees
centigrade
the
injections
couldnt
get
it
to
go
a
single
degree
higher
but
since
salt
water
freezes
only
at
2
degrees
i
was
finally
assured
that
there
was
no
danger
of
it
solidifying
by
the
next
day
march
27
six
meters
of
ice
had
been
torn
from
the
socket
only
four
meters
were
left
to
be
removed
that
still
meant
fortyeight
hours
of
work
the
air
couldnt
be
renewed
in
the
nautiluss
interior
accordingly
that
day
it
kept
getting
worse
an
unbearable
heaviness
weighed
me
down
near
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
this
agonizing
sensation
affected
me
to
an
intense
degree
yawns
dislocated
my
jaws
my
lungs
were
gasping
in
their
quest
for
that
enkindling
elastic
fluid
required
for
breathing
now
growing
scarcer
and
scarcer
my
mind
was
in
a
daze
i
lay
outstretched
strength
gone
nearly
unconscious
my
gallant
conseil
felt
the
same
symptoms
suffered
the
same
sufferings
yet
never
left
my
side
he
held
my
hand
he
kept
encouraging
me
and
i
even
heard
him
mutter
oh
if
only
i
didnt
have
to
breathe
to
leave
more
air
for
master
it
brought
tears
to
my
eyes
to
hear
him
say
these
words
since
conditions
inside
were
universally
unbearable
how
eagerly
how
happily
we
put
on
our
diving
suits
to
take
our
turns
working
picks
rang
out
on
that
bed
of
ice
arms
grew
weary
hands
were
rubbed
raw
but
who
cared
about
exhaustion
what
difference
were
wounds
lifesustaining
air
reached
our
lungs
we
could
breathe
we
could
breathe
and
yet
nobody
prolonged
his
underwater
work
beyond
the
time
allotted
him
his
shift
over
each
man
surrendered
to
a
gasping
companion
the
air
tank
that
would
revive
him
captain
nemo
set
the
example
and
was
foremost
in
submitting
to
this
strict
discipline
when
his
time
was
up
he
yielded
his
equipment
to
another
and
reentered
the
foul
air
on
board
always
calm
unflinching
and
uncomplaining
that
day
the
usual
work
was
accomplished
with
even
greater
energy
over
the
whole
surface
area
only
two
meters
were
left
to
be
removed
only
two
meters
separated
us
from
the
open
sea
but
the
ships
air
tanks
were
nearly
empty
the
little
air
that
remained
had
to
be
saved
for
the
workmen
not
an
atom
for
the
nautilus
when
i
returned
on
board
i
felt
half
suffocated
what
a
night
im
unable
to
depict
it
such
sufferings
are
indescribable
the
next
day
i
was
shortwinded
headaches
and
staggering
fits
of
dizziness
made
me
reel
like
a
drunk
my
companions
were
experiencing
the
same
symptoms
some
crewmen
were
at
their
last
gasp
that
day
the
sixth
of
our
imprisonment
captain
nemo
concluded
that
picks
and
mattocks
were
too
slow
to
deal
with
the
ice
layer
still
separating
us
from
open
waterand
he
decided
to
crush
this
layer
the
man
had
kept
his
energy
and
composure
he
had
subdued
physical
pain
with
moral
strength
he
could
still
think
plan
and
act
at
his
orders
the
craft
was
eased
off
in
other
words
it
was
raised
from
its
icy
bed
by
a
change
in
its
specific
gravity
when
it
was
afloat
the
crew
towed
it
leading
it
right
above
the
immense
trench
outlined
to
match
the
ships
waterline
next
the
ballast
tanks
filled
with
water
the
boat
sank
and
was
fitted
into
its
socket
just
then
the
whole
crew
returned
on
board
and
the
double
outside
door
was
closed
by
this
point
the
nautilus
was
resting
on
a
bed
of
ice
only
one
meter
thick
and
drilled
by
bores
in
a
thousand
places
the
stopcocks
of
the
ballast
tanks
were
then
opened
wide
and
100
cubic
meters
of
water
rushed
in
increasing
the
nautiluss
weight
by
100000
kilograms
we
waited
we
listened
we
forgot
our
sufferings
we
hoped
once
more
we
had
staked
our
salvation
on
this
one
last
gamble
despite
the
buzzing
in
my
head
i
soon
could
hear
vibrations
under
the
nautiluss
hull
we
tilted
the
ice
cracked
with
an
odd
ripping
sound
like
paper
tearing
and
the
nautilus
began
settling
downward
were
going
through
conseil
muttered
in
my
ear
i
couldnt
answer
him
i
clutched
his
hand
i
squeezed
it
in
an
involuntary
convulsion
all
at
once
carried
away
by
its
frightful
excess
load
the
nautilus
sank
into
the
waters
like
a
cannonball
in
other
words
dropping
as
if
in
a
vacuum
our
full
electric
power
was
then
put
on
the
pumps
which
instantly
began
to
expel
water
from
the
ballast
tanks
after
a
few
minutes
we
had
checked
our
fall
the
pressure
gauge
soon
indicated
an
ascending
movement
brought
to
full
speed
the
propeller
made
the
sheetiron
hull
tremble
down
to
its
rivets
and
we
sped
northward
but
how
long
would
it
take
to
navigate
under
the
ice
bank
to
the
open
sea
another
day
i
would
be
dead
first
half
lying
on
a
couch
in
the
library
i
was
suffocating
my
face
was
purple
my
lips
blue
my
faculties
in
abeyance
i
could
no
longer
see
or
hear
i
had
lost
all
sense
of
time
my
muscles
had
no
power
to
contract
im
unable
to
estimate
the
hours
that
passed
in
this
way
but
i
was
aware
that
my
death
throes
had
begun
i
realized
that
i
was
about
to
die



suddenly
i
regained
consciousness
a
few
whiffs
of
air
had
entered
my
lungs
had
we
risen
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
had
we
cleared
the
ice
bank
no
ned
and
conseil
my
two
gallant
friends
were
sacrificing
themselves
to
save
me
a
few
atoms
of
air
were
still
left
in
the
depths
of
one
rouquayrol
device
instead
of
breathing
it
themselves
they
had
saved
it
for
me
and
while
they
were
suffocating
they
poured
life
into
me
drop
by
drop
i
tried
to
push
the
device
away
they
held
my
hands
and
for
a
few
moments
i
could
breathe
luxuriously
my
eyes
flew
toward
the
clock
it
was
eleven
in
the
morning
it
had
to
be
march
28
the
nautilus
was
traveling
at
the
frightful
speed
of
forty
miles
per
hour
it
was
writhing
in
the
waters
where
was
captain
nemo
had
he
perished
had
his
companions
died
with
him
just
then
the
pressure
gauge
indicated
we
were
no
more
than
twenty
feet
from
the
surface
separating
us
from
the
open
air
was
a
mere
tract
of
ice
could
we
break
through
it
perhaps
in
any
event
the
nautilus
was
going
to
try
in
fact
i
could
feel
it
assuming
an
oblique
position
lowering
its
stern
and
raising
its
spur
the
admission
of
additional
water
was
enough
to
shift
its
balance
then
driven
by
its
powerful
propeller
it
attacked
this
ice
field
from
below
like
a
fearsome
battering
ram
it
split
the
barrier
little
by
little
backing
up
then
putting
on
full
speed
against
the
punctured
tract
of
ice
and
finally
carried
away
by
its
supreme
momentum
it
lunged
through
and
onto
this
frozen
surface
crushing
the
ice
beneath
its
weight
the
hatches
were
openedor
torn
off
if

from

to
the
amazon
how
i
got
onto
the
platform
im
unable
to
say
perhaps
the
canadian
transferred
me
there
but
i
could
breathe
i
could
inhale
the
lifegiving
sea
air
next
to
me
my
two
companions
were
getting
tipsy
on
the
fresh
oxygen
particles
poor
souls
who
have
suffered
from
long
starvation
mustnt
pounce
heedlessly
on
the
first
food
given
them
we
on
the
other
hand
didnt
have
to
practice
such
moderation
we
could
suck
the
atoms
from
the
air
by
the
lungful
and
it
was
the
breeze
the
breeze
itself
that
poured
into
us
this
luxurious
intoxication
ahhh
conseil
was
putting
in
what
fine
oxygen
let
master
have
no
fears
about
breathing
theres
enough
for
everyone
as
for
ned
land
he
didnt
say
a
word
but
his
wideopen
jaws
would
have
scared
off
a
shark
and
what
powerful
inhalations
the
canadian
drew
like
a
furnace
going
full
blast
our
strength
returned
promptly
and
when
i
looked
around
i
saw
that
we
were
alone
on
the
platform
no
crewmen
not
even
captain
nemo
those
strange
seamen
on
the
nautilus
were
content
with
the
oxygen
circulating
inside
not
one
of
them
had
come
up
to
enjoy
the
open
air
the
first
words
i
pronounced
were
words
of
appreciation
and
gratitude
to
my
two
companions
ned
and
conseil
had
kept
me
alive
during
the
final
hours
of
our
long
death
throes
but
no
expression
of
thanks
could
repay
them
fully
for
such
devotion
good
lord
professor
ned
land
answered
me
dont
mention
it
what
did
we
do
thats
so
praiseworthy
not
a
thing
it
was
a
question
of
simple
arithmetic
your
life
is
worth
more
than
ours
so
we
had
to
save
it
no
ned
i
replied
it
isnt
worth
more
nobody
could
be
better
than
a
kind
and
generous
man
like
yourself
all
right
all
right
the
canadian
repeated
in
embarrassment
and
you
my
gallant
conseil
you
suffered
a
great
deal
not
too
much
to
be
candid
with
master
i
was
lacking
a
few
throatfuls
of
air
but
i
would
have
gotten
by
besides
when
i
saw
master
fainting
it
left
me
without
the
slightest
desire
to
breathe
it
took
my
breath
away
in
a
manner
of



confounded
by
this
lapse
into
banality
conseil
left
his
sentence
hanging
my
friends
i
replied
very
moved
were
bound
to
each
other
forever
and
im
deeply
indebted
to
you
which
ill
take
advantage
of
the
canadian
shot
back
eh
conseil
put
in
yes
ned
land
went
on
you
can
repay
your
debt
by
coming
with
me
when
i
leave
this
infernal
nautilus
by
the
way
conseil
said
are
we
going
in
a
favorable
direction
yes
i
replied
because
were
going
in
the
direction
of
the
sun
and
here
the
sun
is
due
north
sure
ned
land
went
on
but
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
well
make
for
the
atlantic
or
the
pacific
in
other
words
whether
well
end
up
in
welltraveled
or
deserted
seas
i
had
no
reply
to
this
and
i
feared
that
captain
nemo
wouldnt
take
us
homeward
but
rather
into
that
huge
ocean
washing
the
shores
of
both
asia
and
america
in
this
way
he
would
complete
his
underwater
tour
of
the
world
going
back
to
those
seas
where
the
nautilus
enjoyed
the
greatest
freedom
but
if
we
returned
to
the
pacific
far
from
every
populated
shore
what
would
happen
to
ned
lands
plans
we
would
soon
settle
this
important
point
the
nautilus
traveled
swiftly
soon
we
had
cleared
the
antarctic
circle
plus
the
promontory
of
cape
horn
we
were
abreast
of
the
tip
of
south
america
by
march
31
at
seven
oclock
in
the
evening
by
then
all
our
past
sufferings
were
forgotten
the
memory
of
that
imprisonment
under
the
ice
faded
from
our
minds
we
had
thoughts
only
of
the
future
captain
nemo
no
longer
appeared
neither
in
the
lounge
nor
on
the
platform
the
positions
reported
each
day
on
the
world
map
were
put
there
by
the
chief
officer
and
they
enabled
me
to
determine
the
nautiluss
exact
heading
now
then
that
evening
it
became
obvious
much
to
my
satisfaction
that
we
were
returning
north
by
the
atlantic
route
i
shared
the
results
of
my
observations
with
the
canadian
and
conseil
thats
good
news
the
canadian
replied
but
wheres
the
nautilus
going
im
unable
to
say
ned
after
the
south
pole
does
our
captain
want
to
tackle
the
north
pole
then
go
back
to
the
pacific
by
the
notorious
northwest
passage
i
wouldnt
double
dare
him
conseil
replied
oh
well
the
canadian
said
well
give
him
the
slip
long
before
then
in
any
event
conseil
added
hes
a
superman
that
captain
nemo
and
well
never
regret
having
known
him
especially
once
weve
left
him
ned
land
shot
back
the
next
day
april
1
when
the
nautilus
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
a
few
minutes
before
noon
we
raised
land
to
the
west
it
was
tierra
del
fuego
the
land
of
fire
a
name
given
it
by
early
navigators
after
they
saw
numerous
curls
of
smoke
rising
from
the
natives
huts
this
land
of
fire
forms
a
huge
cluster
of
islands
over
thirty
leagues
long
and
eighty
leagues
wide
extending
between
latitude
53
degrees
and
56
degrees
south
and
between
longitude
67
degrees
50
and
77
degrees
15
west
its
coastline
looked
flat
but
high
mountains
rose
in
the
distance
i
even
thought
i
glimpsed
mt
sarmiento
whose
elevation
is
2070
meters
above
sea
level
a
pyramidshaped
block
of
shale
with
a
very
sharp
summit
which
depending
on
whether
its
clear
or
veiled
in
vapor
predicts
fair
weather
or
foul
as
ned
land
told
me
a
firstclass
barometer
my
friend
yes
sir
a
natural
barometer
that
didnt
let
me
down
when
i
navigated
the
narrows
of
the
strait
of
magellan
just
then
its
peak
appeared
before
us
standing
out
distinctly
against
the
background
of
the
skies
this
forecast
fair
weather
and
so
it
proved
going
back
under
the
waters
the
nautilus
drew
near
the
coast
cruising
along
it
for
only
a
few
miles
through
the
lounge
windows
i
could
see
long
creepers
and
gigantic
fucus
plants
bulbbearing
seaweed
of
which
the
open
sea
at
the
pole
had
revealed
a
few
specimens
with
their
smooth
viscous
filaments
they
measured
as
much
as
300
meters
long
genuine
cables
more
than
an
inch
thick
and
very
tough
theyre
often
used
as
mooring
lines
for
ships
another
weed
known
by
the
name
velp
and
boasting
fourfoot
leaves
was
crammed
into
the
coral
concretions
and
carpeted
the
ocean
floor
it
served
as
both
nest
and
nourishment
for
myriads
of
crustaceans
and
mollusks
for
crabs
and
cuttlefish
here
seals
and
otters
could
indulge
in
a
sumptuous
meal
mixing
meat
from
fish
with
vegetables
from
the
sea
like
the
english
with
their
irish
stews
the
nautilus
passed
over
these
lush
luxuriant
depths
with
tremendous
speed
near
evening
it
approached
the
falkland
islands
whose
rugged
summits
i
recognized
the
next
day
the
sea
was
of
moderate
depth
so
not
without
good
reason
i
assumed
that
these
two
islands
plus
the
many
islets
surrounding
them
used
to
be
part
of
the
magellan
coastline
the
falkland
islands
were
probably
discovered
by
the
famous
navigator
john
davis
who
gave
them
the
name
davis
southern
islands
later
sir
richard
hawkins
called
them
the
maidenland
after
the
blessed
virgin
subsequently
at
the
beginning
of
the
18th
century
they
were
named
the
malouines
by
fishermen
from
saintmalo
in
brittany
then
finally
dubbed
the
falklands
by
the
english
to
whom
they
belong
today
in
these
waterways
our
nets
brought
up
fine
samples
of
algae
in
particular
certain
fucus
plants
whose
roots
were
laden
with
the
worlds
best
mussels
geese
and
duck
alighted
by
the
dozens
on
the
platform
and
soon
took
their
places
in
the
ships
pantry
as
for
fish
i
specifically
observed
some
bony
fish
belonging
to
the
goby
genus
especially
some
gudgeon
two
decimeters
long
sprinkled
with
whitish
and
yellow
spots
i
likewise
marveled
at
the
numerous
medusas
including
the
most
beautiful
of
their
breed
the
compass
jellyfish
unique
to
the
falkland
seas
some
of
these
jellyfish
were
shaped
like
very
smooth
semispheric
parasols
with
russet
stripes
and
fringes
of
twelve
neat
festoons
others
looked
like
upsidedown
baskets
from
which
wide
leaves
and
long
red
twigs
were
gracefully
trailing
they
swam
with
quiverings
of
their
four
leaflike
arms
letting
the
opulent
tresses
of
their
tentacles
dangle
in
the
drift
i
wanted
to
preserve
a
few
specimens
of
these
delicate
zoophytes
but
they
were
merely
clouds
shadows
illusions
melting
and
evaporating
outside
their
native
element
when
the
last
tips
of
the
falkland
islands
had
disappeared
below
the
horizon
the
nautilus
submerged
to
a
depth
between
twenty
and
twentyfive
meters
and
went
along
the
south
american
coast
captain

didnt
leave
these
patagonian
waterways
until

3
sometimes
cruising
under
the

sometimes
on

the

by
the
mouth
of
the
rio
de

and
on

we
lay
abreast
of
uruguay
albeit
fifty

it
followed
the

captain
nemo
had
no
liking
for
the
neighborhood
of
brazils

because
he
shot
by
with
dizzying
speed
not
even
the
swiftest
fish
or
birds
could
keep
up
with
us
and
the
natural
curiosities
in
these
seas
completely
eluded
our
observation
this
speed
was
maintained
for
several
days
and
on
the
evening
of

9
we
raised
south
americas
easternmost
tip

roque
but
then
the
nautilus
veered
away
again
and
went
looking
for
the

of
an
underwater

the
nautiluss
library
charts
obviously
rendered
by
captain
nemo
himself
from
his
own
personal
observations
for
two
days
we
visited
these
deep
and
deserted
waters
by
means
of
our
slanting
fins
the
nautilus
would
do
long
diagonal
dives
that
took
us
to
every
level
but
on
april
11
it
rose
suddenly
and
the
shore
reappeared
at
the
mouth
of
the
amazon
river
a
huge
estuary
whose
outflow
is
so
considerable
it
desalts
the
sea
over
an
area
of
several
leagues
we
cut
the
equator
twenty
miles
to
the
west
lay
guiana
french
territory
where
we
could
easily
have
taken
refuge
but
the
wind
was
blowing
a
strong
gust
and
the
furious
billows
would
not
allow
us
to
face
them
in
a
mere
skiff
no
doubt
ned
land
understood
this
because
he
said
nothing
to
me
for
my
part
i
made
no
allusion
to
his
escape
plans
because
i
didnt
want
to
push
him
into
an
attempt
that
was
certain
to
misfire
i
was
readily
compensated
for
this
delay
by
fascinating
research
during
those
two
days
of
april
1112
the
nautilus
didnt
leave
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
its
trawl
brought
up
a
simply
miraculous
catch
of
zoophytes
fish
and
reptiles
some
zoophytes
were
dredged
up
by
the
chain
of
our
trawl
most
were
lovely

belonging
to
the
family

including
among
other
species

to
this
part
of
the
ocean

small
cylindrical

adorned
with
vertical
lines
mottled
with
red
spots
and
crowned
by
a
wondrous
blossoming
of
tentacles

for
mollusks
they
consisted
of

had
already
observed

the
tent

looked
like
petrified
scorpions

some
highly
edible
cuttlefish
and
certain
species
of
squid
that
the
naturalists
of
antiquity
classified
with
the
flying
fish
which
are
used
chiefly
as
bait
for
catching
cod
as
for
the
fish
in
these
waterways
i
noted
various
species

i
hadnt

quite
accurate
with
the

this
et
cetera
wont
keep
me
from
mentioning
one
more
fish
that
conseil
with
good
reason
will
long
remember
one
of
our
nets
had
hauled
up
a
type
of
very
flat
ray
that
weighed
some
twenty
kilograms
with
its
tail
cut
off
it
would
have
formed
a
perfect
disk
it
was
white
underneath
and
reddish
on
top
with
big
round
spots
of
deep
blue
encircled
in
black
its
hide
quite
smooth
and
ending
in
a
doublelobed
fin
laid
out
on
the
platform
it
kept
struggling
with
convulsive
movements
trying
to
turn
over
making
such
efforts
that
its
final
lunge
was
about
to
flip
it
into
the
sea
but
conseil
being
very
possessive
of
his
fish
rushed
at
it
and
before
i
could
stop
him
he
seized
it
with
both
hands
instantly
there
he
was
thrown
on
his
back
legs
in
the
air
his
body
half
paralyzed
and
yelling
oh
sir
sir
will
you
help
me
for
once
in
his
life
the
poor
lad
didnt
address
me
in
the
third
person
the
canadian
and
i
sat
him
up
we
massaged
his
contracted
arms
and
when
he
regained
his
five
senses
that
eternal
classifier
mumbled
in
a
broken
voice
class
of
cartilaginous
fish
order
chondropterygia
with
fixed
gills
suborder
selacia

rajiiforma
genus
electric
ray
yes
my
friend
i
answered
it
was
an
electric
ray
that
put
you
in
this
deplorable
state
oh
master
can
trust
me
on
this
conseil
shot
back
ill
be
revenged
on
that
animal
how
ill
eat
it
which
he
did
that
same
evening
but
strictly
as
retaliation
because
frankly
it
tasted
like
leather
poor
conseil
had
assaulted
an
electric
ray
of
the
most
dangerous
species
the
cumana
living
in
a
conducting
medium
such
as
water
this
bizarre
animal
can
electrocute
other
fish
from
several
meters
away
so
great
is
the
power
of
its
electric
organ
an
organ
whose
two
chief
surfaces
measure
at
least
twentyseven
square
feet
during
the
course
of
the
next
day
april
12
the
nautilus
drew
near
the
coast
of
dutch
guiana
by
the
mouth
of
the
maroni
river
there
several
groups
of
sea
cows
were
living
in
family
units
these
were
manatees
which
belong
to
the
order
sirenia
like
the
dugong
and
stellers
sea
cow
harmless
and
unaggressive
these
fine
animals
were
six
to
seven
meters
long
and
must
have
weighed
at
least
4000
kilograms
each
i
told
ned
land
and
conseil
that
farseeing
nature
had
given
these
mammals
a
major
role
to
play
in
essence
manatees
like
seals
are
designed
to
graze
the
underwater
prairies
destroying
the
clusters
of
weeds
that
obstruct
the
mouths
of
tropical
rivers
and
do
you
know
i
added
what
happened
since
man
has
almost
completely
wiped
out
these
beneficial
races
rotting
weeds
have
poisoned
the
air
and
this
poisoned
air
causes
the
yellow
fever
that
devastates
these
wonderful
countries
this
toxic
vegetation
has
increased
beneath
the
seas
of
the
torrid
zone
so
the
disease
spreads
unchecked
from
the
mouth
of
the
rio
de
la
plata
to
florida
and
if
professor
toussenel
is
correct
this
plague
is
nothing
compared
to
the
scourge
that
will
strike
our
descendants
once
the
seas
are
depopulated
of
whales
and
seals
by
then
crowded
with
jellyfish
squid
and
other
devilfish
the
oceans
will
have
become
huge
centers
of
infection
because
their
waves
will
no
longer
possess
these
huge
stomachs
that
god
has
entrusted
with
scouring
the
surface
of
the
sea
meanwhile
without
scorning
these
theories
the
nautiluss
crew
captured
half
a
dozen
manatees
in
essence
it
was
an
issue
of
stocking
the
larder
with
excellent
red
meat
even
better
than
beef
or
veal
their
hunting
was
not
a
fascinating
sport
the
manatees
let
themselves
be
struck
down
without
offering
any
resistance
several
thousand
kilos
of
meat
were
hauled
below
to
be
dried
and
stored
the
same
day
an
odd
fishing
practice
further
increased
the
nautiluss
stores
so
full
of
game
were
these
seas
our
trawl
brought
up
in
its
meshes
a
number
of
fish
whose
heads
were
topped
by
little
oval
slabs
with
fleshy
edges
these
were
suckerfish
from
the
third
family
of
the
subbrachian
malacopterygia
these
flat
disks
on
their
heads
consist
of
crosswise
plates
of
movable
cartilage
between
which
the
animals
can
create
a
vacuum
enabling
them
to
stick
to
objects
like
suction
cups
the
remoras
i
had
observed
in
the
mediterranean
were
related
to
this
species
but
the
creature
at
issue
here
was
an
echeneis
osteochara
unique
to
this
sea
right
after
catching
them
our
seamen
dropped
them
in
buckets
of
water
its
fishing
finished
the
nautilus
drew
nearer
to
the
coast
in
this
locality
a
number
of
sea
turtles
were
sleeping
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
capture
these
valuable
reptiles
because
they
wake
up
at
the
slightest
sound
and
their
solid
carapaces
are
harpoonproof
but
our
suckerfish
would
effect
their
capture
with
extraordinary
certainty
and
precision
in
truth
this
animal
is
a
living
fishhook
promising
wealth
and
happiness
to
the
greenest
fisherman
in
the
business
the
nautiluss
men
attached
to
each
fishs
tail
a
ring
that
was
big
enough
not
to
hamper
its
movements
and
to
this
ring
a
long
rope
whose
other
end
was
moored
on
board
thrown
into
the
sea
the
suckerfish
immediately
began
to
play
their
roles
going
and
fastening
themselves
onto
the
breastplates
of
the
turtles
their
tenacity
was
so
great
they
would
rip
apart
rather
than
let
go
they
were
hauled
in
still
sticking
to
the
turtles
that
came
aboard
with
them
in
this
way
we
caught
several
loggerheads
reptiles
a
meter
wide
and
weighing
200
kilos
theyre
extremely
valuable
because
of
their
carapaces
which
are
covered
with
big
slabs
of
horn
thin
brown
transparent
with
white
and
yellow
markings
besides
they
were
excellent
from
an
edible
viewpoint
with
an
exquisite
flavor
comparable
to
the
green
turtle
this
fishing
ended
our
stay
in
the
waterways
of
the
amazon
and
that
evening
the
nautilus
took
to
the
high
seas
once
more
chapter
18
the
devilfish
for
some
days
the
nautilus
kept
veering
away
from
the
american
coast
it
obviously
didnt
want
to
frequent
the
waves
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
or
the
caribbean
sea
yet
there
was
no
shortage
of
water
under
its
keel
since
the
average
depth
of
these
seas
is
1800
meters
but
these
waterways
strewn
with
islands
and
plowed
by
steamers
probably
didnt
agree
with
captain
nemo
on
april
16
we
raised
martinique
and
guadalupe
from
a
distance
of
about
thirty
miles
for
one
instant
i
could
see
their
lofty
peaks
the
canadian
was
quite
disheartened
having
counted
on
putting
his
plans
into
execution
in
the
gulf
either
by
reaching
shore
or
by
pulling
alongside
one
of
the
many
boats
plying
a
coastal
trade
from
one
island
to
another
an
escape
attempt
would
have
been
quite
feasible
assuming
ned
land
managed
to
seize
the
skiff
without
the
captains
knowledge
but
in
midocean
it
was
unthinkable
the
canadian
conseil
and
i
had
a
pretty
long
conversation
on
this
subject
for
six
months
we
had
been
prisoners
aboard
the
nautilus
we
had
fared
17000
leagues
and
as
ned
land
put
it
there
was
no
end
in
sight
so
he
made
me
a
proposition
i
hadnt
anticipated
we
were
to
ask
captain
nemo
this
question
straight
out
did
the
captain
mean
to
keep
us
on
board
his
vessel
permanently
this
measure
was
distasteful
to
me
to
my
mind
it
would
lead
nowhere
we
could
hope
for
nothing
from
the
nautiluss
commander
but
could
depend
only
on
ourselves
besides
for
some
time
now
the
man
had
been
gloomier
more
withdrawn
less
sociable
he
seemed
to
be
avoiding
me
i
encountered
him
only
at
rare
intervals
he
used
to
take
pleasure
in
explaining
the
underwater
wonders
to
me
now
he
left
me
to
my
research
and
no
longer
entered
the
lounge
what
changes
had
come
over
him
from
what
cause
i
had
no
reason
to
blame
myself
was
our
presence
on
board
perhaps
a
burden
to
him
even
so
i
cherished
no
hopes
that
the
man
would
set
us
free
so
i
begged
ned
to
let
me
think
about
it
before
taking
action
if
this
measure
proved
fruitless
it
could
arouse
the
captains
suspicions
make
our
circumstances
even
more
arduous
and
jeopardize
the
canadians
plans
i
might
add
that
i
could
hardly
use
our
state
of
health
as
an
argument
except
for
that
grueling
ordeal
under
the
ice
bank
at
the
south
pole
we
had
never
felt
better
neither
ned
conseil
nor
i
the
nutritious
food
lifegiving
air
regular
routine
and
uniform
temperature
kept
illness
at
bay
and
for
a
man
who
didnt
miss
his
past
existence
on
land
for
a
captain
nemo
who
was
at
home
here
who
went
where
he
wished
who
took
paths
mysterious
to
others
if
not
himself
in
attaining
his
ends
i
could
understand
such
a
life
but
we
ourselves
hadnt
severed
all
ties
with
humanity
for
my
part
i
didnt
want
my
new
and
unusual
research
to
be
buried
with
my
bones
i
had
now
earned
the
right
to
pen
the
definitive
book
on
the
sea
and
sooner
or
later
i
wanted
that
book
to
see
the
light
of
day
there
once
more
through
the
panels
opening
into
these
caribbean
waters
ten
meters
below
the
surface
of
the
waves
i
found
so
many
fascinating
exhibits
to
describe
in
my
daily
notes
among
other
zoophytes
there
were
portuguese

known
by
the

physalia

like
big
oblong
bladders
with
a
pearly
sheen
spreading
their
membranes
to
the
wind
letting
their
blue
tentacles
drift
like
silken
threads
to
the
eye
delightful
jellyfish
to
the
touch
actual
nettles
that
ooze
a
corrosive
liquid
among
the
articulates
there
were
annelid
worms
one

a
half
meters
long
furnished
with
a
pink
proboscis
equipped
with
1700
organs
of
locomotion
snaking
through
the
waters
and
as
they
went
throwing
off
every
gleam
in
the
solar
spectrum
from
the
fish
branch
there
were
manta

enormous

ten
feet
long
and
weighing
600
pounds

attached
to

of
the

at
the
front
of
the
head
they
floated
like
wreckage
from
a
ship
sometimes
fastening
onto
our
windows
like
opaque
shutters
there
were
american
triggerfish
for
which
nature
has
ground
only
black

white
pigments
feathershaped
gobies
that

with
short
sharp

covered
with

came
swarms
of
red

corseted
in
gold

from

their
shining

on

many

we
had

the
nearest

was
the

of

scattered
like
a
batch
of
cobblestones
over
the

there
high
underwater
cliffs
reared
up
straight

made

arranged

there
gaped
black

so
deep
our
electric

couldnt

colossal

conseil
ned
and
i
were
naturally
led
into
mentioning
the
seas
gigantic
animals
the
former
were
obviously
meant
to
feed
the
latter
however
through
the
windows
of
our
almost
motionless
nautilus
i
could
see
nothing
among
these
long
filaments
other
than
the
chief
articulates
of
the
division
brachyura
longlegged
spider

violet

and
sponge

unique
to

it
was
about
eleven
oclock
when
ned
land
drew
my
attention
to
a
fearsome
commotion
out
in
this
huge
seaweed
well
i
said
these
are
real
devilfish
caverns
and
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
to
see
some
of
those
monsters
hereabouts
what
conseil
put
in
squid
ordinary
squid
from
the
class
cephalopoda
no
i
said
devilfish
of
large
dimensions
but
friend
land
is
no
doubt
mistaken
because
i
dont
see
a
thing
thats
regrettable
conseil
answered
id
like
to
come
face
to

with
one
of
those
devilfish
ive
heard
so
much
about
which
can
drag
ships
down
into
the
depths
those
beasts
go
by
the
name
of
krake
fake

more
like

the
canadian
replied
sarcastically
krakens
conseil
shot
back
finishing
his
word
without
wincing
at
his
companions
witticism
nobody
will
ever
make
me
believe
ned

said
that
such
animals
exist
why
not
conseil
replied
we
sincerely
believed
in

narwhale
we
were
wrong
conseil
no
doubt
but
there
are
others
with
no
doubts
who
believe
to
this
day
probably
conseil
but
as
for
me
im
bound
and
determined
not
to
accept
the
existence
of
any
such
monster
till
ive
dissected
it
with
my
own
two
hands
yet
conseil
asked
me
doesnt
master
believe
in
gigantic
devilfish
yikes
who
in
hades
ever
believed
in
them
the
canadian
exclaimed
many
people
ned
my
friend
i
said
no
fishermen
scientists
maybe
pardon
me
ned
fishermen
and
scientists
why
i
to
whom
you
speak
conseil
said
with
the
worlds
straightest
face
i
recall
perfectly
seeing
a
large
boat
dragged
under
the
waves
by
the
arms
of
a
cephalopod
you
saw
that
the
canadian
asked
yes
ned
with
your
own
two
eyes
with
my
own
two
eyes
where
may
i
ask
in
saintmalo
conseil
returned
unflappably
in
the
harbor
ned
land
said
sarcastically
no
in
a
church
conseil
replied
in
a
church
the
canadian
exclaimed
yes
ned
my
friend
it
had
a
picture
that
portrayed
the
devilfish
in
question
oh
good
ned
land
exclaimed
with
a
burst
of
laughter
mr
conseil
put
one
over
on
me
actually
hes
right
i
said
ive
heard
about
that
picture
but
the
subject
it
portrays
is
taken
from
a
legend
and
you
know
how
to
rate
legends
in
matters
of
natural
history
besides
when
its
an
issue
of
monsters
the
human
imagination
always
tends
to
run
wild
people
not
only
claimed
these
devilfish
could
drag
ships
under
but
a
certain
olaus
magnus
tells
of
a
cephalopod
a
mile
long
that
looked
more
like
an
island
than
an
animal
theres
also
the
story
of
how
the
bishop
of
trondheim
set
up
an
altar
one
day
on
an
immense
rock
after
he
finished
saying
mass
this
rock
started
moving
and
went
back
into
the
sea
the
rock
was
a
devilfish
and
thats
everything
we
know
the
canadian
asked
no
i
replied
another
bishop
pontoppidan
of
bergen
also
tells
of
a
devilfish
so
large
a
whole
cavalry
regiment
could
maneuver
on
it
they
sure
did
go
on
those
oldtime
bishops
ned
land
said
finally
the
naturalists
of
antiquity
mention
some
monsters
with
mouths
as
big
as
a
gulf
which
were
too
huge
to
get
through
the
strait
of
gibraltar
good
work
men
the
canadian
put
in
but
in
all
these
stories
is
there
any
truth
conseil
asked
none
at
all
my
friends
at
least
in
those
that
go
beyond
the
bounds
of
credibility
and
fly
off
into
fable
or
legend
yet
for
the
imaginings
of
these
storytellers
there
had
to
be
if
not
a
cause
at
least
an
excuse
it
cant
be
denied
that
some
species
of
squid
and
other
devilfish
are
quite
large
though
still
smaller
than
cetaceans
aristotle
put
the
dimensions
of
one
squid
at
five
cubits
or
31
meters
our
fishermen
frequently
see
specimens
over
18
meters
long
the
museums
in
trieste
and
montpellier
have
preserved
some
devilfish
carcasses
measuring
two
meters
besides
according
to
the
calculations
of
naturalists
one
of
these
animals
only
six
feet
long
would
have
tentacles
as
long
as
twentyseven
which
is
enough
to
make
a
fearsome
monster
does
anybody
fish
for
em
nowadays
the
canadian
asked
if
they
dont
fish
for
them
sailors
at
least
sight
them
a
friend
of
mine
captain
paul
bos
of
le
havre
has
often
sworn
to
me
that
he
encountered
one
of
these
monsters
of
colossal
size
in
the
seas
of
the
east
indies
but
the
most
astonishing
event
which
proves
that
these
gigantic
animals
undeniably
exist
took
place
a
few
years
ago
in
1861
what
event
was
that
ned
land
asked
just
this
in
1861
to
the
northeast
of
tenerife
and
fairly
near
the
latitude
where
we
are
right
now
the
crew
of
the
gunboat
alecto
spotted
a
monstrous
squid
swimming
in
their
waters
commander
bouguer
approached
the
animal
and
attacked
it
with
blows
from
harpoons
and
blasts
from
rifles
but
without
much
success
because
bullets
and
harpoons
crossed
its
soft
flesh
as
if
it
were
semiliquid
jelly
after
several
fruitless
attempts
the
crew
managed
to
slip
a
noose
around
the
mollusks
body
this
noose
slid
as
far
as
the
caudal
fins
and
came
to
a
halt
then
they
tried
to
haul
the
monster
on
board
but
its
weight
was
so
considerable
that
when
they
tugged
on
the
rope
the
animal
parted
company
with
its
tail
and
deprived
of
this
adornment
it
disappeared
beneath
the
waters
finally
an
actual
event
ned
land
said
an
indisputable
event
my
gallant
ned
accordingly
people
have
proposed
naming
this
devilfish
bouguers
squid
and
how
long
was
it
the
canadian
asked
didnt
it
measure
about
six
meters
said
conseil
who
was
stationed
at
the
window
and
examining
anew
the
crevices
in
the
cliff
precisely
i
replied
wasnt
its
head
conseil
went
on
crowned
by
eight
tentacles
that
quivered
in
the
water
like
a
nest
of
snakes
precisely
werent
its
eyes
prominently
placed
and
considerably
enlarged
yes
conseil
and
wasnt
its
mouth
a
real
parrots
beak
but
of
fearsome
size
correct
conseil
well
with
all
due
respect
to
master
conseil
replied
serenely
if
this
isnt
bouguers
squid
its
at
least
one
of
his
close
relatives
i
stared
at
conseil
ned
land
rushed
to
the
window
what
an
awful
animal
he
exclaimed
i
stared
in
my
turn
and
couldnt
keep
back
a
movement
of
revulsion
before
my
eyes
there
quivered
a
horrible
monster
worthy
of
a
place
among
the
most
farfetched
teratological
legends
it
was
a
squid
of
colossal
dimensions
fully
eight
meters
long
it
was
traveling
backward
with
tremendous
speed
in
the
same
direction
as
the
nautilus
it
gazed
with
enormous
staring
eyes
that
were
tinted
sea
green
its
eight
arms
or
more
accurately
feet
were
rooted
in
its
head
which
has
earned
these
animals
the
name
cephalopod
its
arms
stretched
a
distance
twice
the
length
of
its
body
and
were
writhing
like
the
serpentine
hair
of
the
furies
you
could
plainly
see
its
250
suckers
arranged
over
the
inner
sides
of
its
tentacles
and
shaped
like
semispheric
capsules
sometimes
these
suckers
fastened
onto
the
lounge
window
by
creating
vacuums
against
it
the
monsters
moutha
beak
made
of
horn
and
shaped
like
that
of
a
parrotopened
and
closed
vertically
its
tongue
also
of
horn
substance
and
armed
with
several
rows
of
sharp
teeth
would
flicker
out
from
between
these
genuine
shears
what
a
freak
of
nature
a
birds
beak
on
a
mollusk
its
body
was
spindleshaped
and
swollen
in
the
middle
a
fleshy
mass
that
must
have
weighed
20000
to
25000
kilograms
its
unstable
color
would
change
with
tremendous
speed
as
the
animal
grew
irritated
passing
successively
from
bluish
gray
to
reddish
brown
what
was
irritating
this
mollusk
no
doubt
the
presence
of
the
nautilus
even
more
fearsome
than
itself
and
which
it
couldnt
grip
with
its
mandibles
or
the
suckers
on
its
arms
and
yet
what
monsters
these
devilfish
are
what
vitality
our
creator
has
given
them
what
vigor
in
their
movements
thanks
to
their
owning
a
triple
heart
sheer
chance
had
placed
us
in
the
presence
of
this
squid
and
i
didnt
want
to
lose
this
opportunity
to
meticulously
study
such
a
cephalopod
specimen
i
overcame
the
horror
that
its
appearance
inspired
in
me
picked
up
a
pencil
and
began
to
sketch
it
perhaps
this
is
the
same
as
the
alectos
conseil
said
cant
be
the
canadian
replied
because
this
ones
complete
while
the
other
one
lost
its
tail
that
doesnt
necessarily
follow
i
said
the
arms
and
tails
of
these
animals
grow
back
through
regeneration
and
in
seven
years
the
tail
on
bouguers
squid
has
surely
had
time
to
sprout
again
anyhow
ned
shot
back
if
it
isnt
this
fellow
maybe
its
one
of
those
indeed
other
devilfish
had
appeared
at
the
starboard
window
i
counted
seven
of
them
they
provided
the
nautilus
with
an
escort
and
i
could
hear
their
beaks
gnashing
on
the
sheetiron
hull
we
couldnt
have
asked
for
a
more
devoted
following
i
continued
sketching
these
monsters
kept
pace
in
our
waters
with
such
precision
they
seemed
to
be
standing
still
and
i
could
have
traced
their
outlines
in
miniature
on
the
window
but
we
were
moving
at
a
moderate
speed
all
at
once
the
nautilus
stopped
a
jolt
made
it
tremble
through
its
entire
framework
did
we
strike
bottom
i
asked
in
any
event
were
already
clear
the
canadian
replied
because
were
afloat
the
nautilus
was
certainly
afloat
but
it
was
no
longer
in
motion
the
blades
of
its
propeller
werent
churning
the
waves
a
minute
passed
followed
by
his
chief
officer
captain
nemo
entered
the
lounge
i
hadnt
seen
him
for
a
good
while
he
looked
gloomy
to
me
without
speaking
to
us
without
even
seeing
us
perhaps
he
went
to
the
panel
stared
at
the
devilfish
and
said
a
few
words
to
his
chief
officer
the
latter
went
out
soon
the
panels
closed
the
ceiling
lit
up
i
went
over
to
the
captain
an
unusual
assortment
of
devilfish
i
told
him
as
carefree
as
a
collector
in
front
of
an
aquarium
correct
mr
naturalist
he
answered
me
and
were
going
to
fight
them
at
close
quarters
i
gaped
at
the
captain
i
thought
my
hearing
had
gone
bad
at
close
quarters
i
repeated
yes
sir
our
propeller
is
jammed
i
think
the
horncovered
mandibles
of
one
of
these
squid
are
entangled
in
the
blades
thats
why
we
arent
moving
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
rise
to
the
surface
and
slaughter
the
vermin
a
difficult
undertaking
correct
our
electric
bullets
are
ineffective
against
such
soft
flesh
where
they
dont
meet
enough
resistance
to
go
off
but
well
attack
the
beasts
with
axes
and
harpoons
sir
the
canadian
said
if
you
dont
turn
down
my
help
i
accept
it
mr
land
well
go
with
you
i
said
and
we
followed
captain
nemo
heading
to
the
central
companionway
there
some
ten
men
were
standing
by
for
the
assault
armed
with
boarding
axes
conseil
and
i
picked
up
two
more
axes
ned
land
seized
a
harpoon
by
then
the
nautilus
had
returned
to
the
surface
of
the
waves
stationed
on
the
top
steps
one
of
the
seamen
undid
the
bolts
of
the
hatch
but
he
had
scarcely
unscrewed
the
nuts
when
the
hatch
flew
up
with
tremendous
violence
obviously
pulled
open
by
the
suckers
on
a
devilfishs
arm
instantly
one
of
those
long
arms
glided
like
a
snake
into
the
opening
and
twenty
others
were
quivering
above
with
a
sweep
of
the
ax
captain
nemo
chopped
off
this
fearsome
tentacle
which
slid
writhing
down
the
steps
just
as
we
were
crowding
each
other
to
reach
the
platform
two
more
arms
lashed
the
air
swooped
on
the
seaman
stationed
in
front
of
captain
nemo
and
carried
the
fellow
away
with
irresistible
violence
captain
nemo
gave
a
shout
and
leaped
outside
we
rushed
after
him
what
a
scene
seized
by
the
tentacle
and
glued
to
its
suckers
the
unfortunate
man
was
swinging
in
the
air
at
the
mercy
of
this
enormous
appendage
he
gasped
he
choked
he
yelled
help
help
these
words
pronounced
in
french
left
me
deeply
stunned
so
i
had
a
fellow
countryman
on
board
perhaps
several
ill
hear
his
harrowing
plea
the
rest
of
my
life
the
poor
fellow
was
done
for
who
could
tear
him
from
such
a
powerful
grip
even
so
captain
nemo
rushed
at
the
devilfish
and
with
a
sweep
of
the
ax
hewed
one
more
of
its
arms
his
chief
officer
struggled
furiously
with
other
monsters
crawling
up
the
nautiluss
sides
the
crew
battled
with
flailing
axes
the
canadian
conseil
and
i
sank
our
weapons
into
these
fleshy
masses
an
intense
musky
odor
filled
the
air
it
was
horrible
for
an
instant
i
thought
the
poor
man
entwined
by
the
devilfish
might
be
torn
loose
from
its
powerful
suction
seven
arms
out
of
eight
had
been
chopped
off
brandishing
its
victim
like
a
feather
one
lone
tentacle
was
writhing
in
the
air
but
just
as
captain
nemo
and
his
chief
officer
rushed
at
it
the
animal
shot
off
a
spout
of
blackish
liquid
secreted
by
a
pouch
located
in
its
abdomen
it
blinded
us
when
this
cloud
had
dispersed
the
squid
was
gone
and
so
was
my
poor
fellow
countryman
what
rage
then
drove
us
against
these
monsters
we
lost
all
selfcontrol
ten
or
twelve
devilfish
had
overrun
the
nautiluss
platform
and
sides
we
piled
helterskelter
into
the
thick
of
these
sawedoff
snakes
which
darted
over
the
platform
amid
waves
of
blood
and
sepia
ink
it
seemed
as
if
these
viscous
tentacles
grew
back
like
the
many
heads
of
hydra
at
every
thrust
ned
lands
harpoon
would
plunge
into
a
squids
seagreen
eye
and
burst
it
but
my
daring
companion
was
suddenly
toppled
by
the
tentacles
of
a
monster
he
could
not
avoid
oh
my
heart
nearly
exploded
with
excitement
and
horror
the
squids
fearsome
beak
was
wide
open
over
ned
land
the
poor
man
was
about
to
be
cut
in
half
i
ran
to
his
rescue
but
captain
nemo
got
there
first
his
ax
disappeared
between
the
two
enormous
mandibles
and
the
canadian
miraculously
saved
stood
and
plunged
his
harpoon
all
the
way
into
the
devilfishs
triple
heart
tit
for
tat
captain
nemo
told
the
canadian
i
owed
it
to
myself
ned
bowed
without
answering
him
this
struggle
had
lasted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
defeated
mutilated
battered
to
death
the
monsters
finally
yielded
to
us
and
disappeared
beneath
the
waves
red
with
blood
motionless
by
the
beacon
captain
nemo
stared
at
the
sea
that
had
swallowed
one
of
his
companions
and
large
tears
streamed
from
his
eyes

this
dreadful
scene
on
april
20
none
of
us
will
ever
be
able
to
forget
i
wrote
it
up
in
a
state
of
intense
excitement
later
i
reviewed
my
narrative
i
read
it
to
conseil
and
the
canadian
they
found
it
accurate
in
detail
but
deficient
in
impact
to
convey
such
sights
it
would
take
the
pen
of
our
most
famous
poet
victor
hugo
author
of
the
toilers
of
the
sea
as
i
said
captain
nemo
wept
while
staring
at
the
waves
his
grief
was
immense
this
was
the
second
companion
he
had
lost
since
we
had
come
aboard
and
what
a
way
to
die
smashed
strangled
crushed
by
the
fearsome
arms
of
a
devilfish
ground
between
its
iron
mandibles
this
friend
would
never
rest
with
his
companions
in
the
placid
waters
of
their
coral
cemetery
as
for
me
what
had
harrowed
my
heart
in
the
thick
of
this
struggle
was
the
despairing
yell
given
by
this
unfortunate
man
forgetting
his
regulation
language
this
poor
frenchman
had
reverted
to
speaking
his
own
mother
tongue
to
fling
out
one
supreme
plea
among
the
nautiluss
crew
allied
body
and
soul
with
captain
nemo
and
likewise
fleeing
from
human
contact
i
had
found
a
fellow
countryman
was
he
the
only
representative
of
france
in
this
mysterious
alliance
obviously
made
up
of
individuals
from
different
nationalities
this
was
just
one
more
of
those
insoluble
problems
that
kept
welling
up
in
my
mind
captain
nemo
reentered
his
stateroom
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
for
a
good
while
but
how
sad
despairing
and
irresolute
he
must
have
felt
to
judge
from
this
ship
whose
soul
he
was
which
reflected
his
every
mood
the
nautilus
no
longer
kept
to
a
fixed
heading
it
drifted
back
and
forth
riding
with
the
waves
like
a
corpse
its
propeller
had
been
disentangled
but
was
barely
put
to
use
it
was
navigating
at
random
it
couldnt
tear
itself
away
from
the
setting
of
this
last
struggle
from
this
sea
that
had
devoured
one
of
its
own
ten
days
went
by
in
this
way
it
was
only
on
may

that
the
nautilus
openly
resumed
its
northbound
course
after
raising
the
bahamas
at
the
mouth
of
old
bahama
channel
we
then
went
with
the
current
of
the
seas
greatest
river
which
has
its
own
banks

i
mean
the

it
is
indeed
a
river
that
runs
independently
through
the
middle
of
the

its

never
mixing
with

the

would
undergo

are
incalculable
near
noon
i
was
on
the

with

i
shared
with
him
the
relevant
details
on
the

my
explanation
was
over
i
invited
him
to
dip
his
hands
into
its
current
conseil
did
so
and
he
was
quite
astonished
to
experience
no
sensation
of
either
hot
or
cold
that
comes
i
told
him
from
the
water
temperature
of
the
gulf
stream
which
as
it
leaves
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
barely
different
from
your
blood
temperature
this
gulf
stream
is
a
huge
heat
generator
that
enables
the
coasts
of
europe
to
be
decked
in
eternal
greenery
and
if
commander
maury
is
correct
were
one
to
harness
the
full
warmth
of
this
current
it
would
supply
enough
heat
to
keep
molten
a
river
of
iron
solder
as
big
as
the
amazon
or
the
missouri
just
then
the
gulf
streams
speed
was
225
meters
per
second
so
distinct
is
its
current
from
the
surrounding
sea
its
confined
waters
stand
out
against
the
ocean
and
operate
on
a
different
level
from
the
colder
waters
murky
as
well
and
very
rich
in
saline
material
their
pure
indigo
contrasts
with
the
green
waves
surrounding
them
moreover
their
line
of
demarcation
is
so
clear
that
abreast
of
the
carolinas
the
nautiluss
spur
cut
the
waves
of
the
gulf
stream
while
its
propeller
was
still
churning
those
belonging
to
the
ocean
this
current
swept
along
with
it
a
whole
host
of
moving
creatures
argonauts
so
common
in
the
mediterranean
voyaged
here
in
schools
of
large
numbers
among
cartilaginous
fish
the
most
remarkable
were
rays
whose
ultra
slender
tails
made
up
nearly
a
third
of
the
body
which
was
shaped
like
a
huge
diamond
twentyfive
feet
long
then
little
onemeter
sharks
the
head
large
the
snout
short
and
rounded
the
teeth
sharp
and
arranged
in
several
rows
the
body
seemingly
covered
with
scales
among
bony
fish
i
noted
grizzled
wrasse
unique
to
these
seas
deepwater
gilthead
whose
iris
has
a
fiery
gleam
onemeter
croakers
whose
large
mouths
bristle
with
small
teeth
and
which
let
out
thin
cries
black
rudderfish
like
those
ive
already
discussed
blue
dorados
accented
with
gold
and
silver
rainbowhued
parrotfish
that
can
rival
the
loveliest
tropical
birds
in
coloring
banded
blennies
with
triangular
heads
bluish
flounder
without
scales
toadfish
covered
with
a
crosswise
yellow
band
in
the
shape
of
a
greek
t
swarms
of
little
freckled
gobies
stippled
with
brown
spots
lungfish
with
silver
heads
and
yellow
tails
various
specimens
of
salmon
mullet
with
slim
figures
and
a
softly
glowing
radiance
that
lacpde
dedicated
to
the
memory
of
his
wife
and
finally
the
american
cavalla
a
handsome
fish
decorated
by
every
honorary
order
bedizened
with
their
every
ribbon
frequenting
the
shores
of
this
great
nation
where
ribbons
and
orders
are
held
in
such
low
esteem
i
might
add
that
during
the
night
the
gulf
streams
phosphorescent
waters
rivaled
the
electric
glow
of
our
beacon
especially
in
the
stormy
weather
that
frequently
threatened
us
on
may
8
while
abreast
of
north
carolina
we
were
across
from
cape
hatteras
once
more
there
the
gulf
stream
is
seventyfive
miles
wide
and
210
meters
deep
the
nautilus
continued
to
wander
at
random
seemingly
all
supervision
had
been
jettisoned
under
these
conditions
i
admit
that
we
could
easily
have
gotten
away
in
fact
the
populous
shores
offered
ready
refuge
everywhere
the
sea
was
plowed
continuously
by
the
many
steamers
providing
service
between
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
new
york
or
boston
and
it
was
crossed
night
and
day
by
little
schooners
engaged
in
coastal
trade
over
various
points
on
the
american
shore
we
could
hope
to
be
picked
up
so
it
was
a
promising
opportunity
despite
the
thirty
miles
that
separated
the
nautilus
from
these
union
coasts
but
one
distressing
circumstance
totally
thwarted
the
canadians
plans
the
weather
was
thoroughly
foul
we
were
approaching
waterways
where
storms
are
commonplace
the
very
homeland
of
tornadoes
and
cyclones
specifically
engendered
by
the
gulf
streams
current
to
face
a
frequently
raging
sea
in
a
frail
skiff
was
a
race
to
certain
disaster
ned
land
conceded
this
himself
so
he
champed
at
the
bit
in
the
grip
of
an
intense
homesickness
that
could
be
cured
only
by
our
escape
sir
he
told
me
that
day
its
got
to
stop
i
want
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
your
nemos
veering
away
from
shore
and
heading
up
north
but
believe
you
me
i
had
my
fill
at
the
south
pole
and
im
not
going
with
him
to
the
north
pole
what
can
we
do
ned
since
it
isnt
feasible
to
escape
right
now
i
keep
coming
back
to
my
idea
weve
got
to
talk
to
the
captain
when
we
were
in
your
own
countrys
seas
you
didnt
say
a
word
now
that
were
in
mine
i
intend
to
speak
up
before
a
few
days
are
out
i
figure
the
nautilus
will
lie
abreast
of
nova
scotia
and
from
there
to
newfoundland
is
the
mouth
of
a
large
gulf
and
the
st
lawrence
empties
into
that
gulf
and
the
st
lawrence
is
my
own
river
the
river
running
by
quebec
my
hometownand
when
i
think
about
all
this
my
gorge
rises
and
my
hair
stands
on
end
honestly
sir
id
rather
jump
overboard
i
cant
stay
here
any
longer
im
suffocating
the
canadian
was
obviously
at
the
end
of
his
patience
his
vigorous
nature
couldnt
adapt
to
this
protracted
imprisonment
his
facial
appearance
was
changing
by
the
day
his
moods
grew
gloomier
and
gloomier
i
had
a
sense
of
what
he
was
suffering
because
i
also
was
gripped
by
homesickness
nearly
seven
months
had
gone
by
without
our
having
any
news
from
shore
moreover
captain
nemos
reclusiveness
his
changed
disposition
and
especially
his
total
silence
since
the
battle
with
the
devilfish
all
made
me
see
things
in
a
different
light
i
no
longer
felt
the
enthusiasm
of
our
first
days
on
board
you
needed
to
be
flemish
like
conseil
to
accept
these
circumstances
living
in
a
habitat
designed
for
cetaceans
and
other
denizens
of
the
deep
truly
if
that
gallant
lad
had
owned
gills
instead
of
lungs
i
think
he
would
have
made
an
outstanding
fish
well
sir
ned
land
went
on
seeing
that
i
hadnt
replied
well
ned
you
want
me
to
ask
captain
nemo
what
he
intends
to
do
with
us
yes
sir
even
though
he
has
already
made
that
clear
yes
i
want
it
settled
once
and
for
all
speak
just
for
me
strictly
on
my
behalf
if
you
want
but
i
rarely
encounter
him
he
positively
avoids
me
all
the
more
reason
you
should
go
look
him
up
ill
confer
with
him
ned
when
the
canadian
asked
insistently
when
i
encounter
him
professor
aronnax
would
you
like
me
to
go
find
him
myself
no
let
me
do
it
tomorrow
today
ned
land
said
so
be
it
ill
see
him
today
i
answered
the
canadian
who
if
he
took
action
himself
would
certainly
have
ruined
everything
i
was
left
to
myself
his
request
granted
i
decided
to
dispose
of
it
immediately
i
like
things
over
and
done
with
i
reentered
my
stateroom
from
there
i
could
hear
movements
inside
captain
nemos
quarters
i
couldnt
pass
up
this
chance
for
an
encounter
i
knocked
on
his
door
i
received
no
reply
i
knocked
again
then
tried
the
knob
the
door
opened
i
entered
the
captain
was
there
he
was
bending
over
his
worktable
and
hadnt
heard
me
determined
not
to
leave
without
questioning
him
i
drew
closer
he
looked
up
sharply
with
a
frowning
brow
and
said
in
a
pretty
stern
tone
oh
its
you
what
do
you
want
to
speak
with
you
captain
but
im
busy
sir
im
at
work
i
give
you
the
freedom
to
enjoy
your
privacy
cant
i
have
the
same
for
myself
this
reception
was
less
than
encouraging
but
i
was
determined
to
give
as
good
as
i
got
sir
i
said
coolly
i
need
to
speak
with
you
on
a
matter
that
simply
cant
wait
whatever
could
that
be
sir
he
replied
sarcastically
have
you
made
some
discovery
that
has
escaped
me
has
the
sea
yielded
up
some
novel
secret
to
you
we
were
miles
apart
but
before
i
could
reply
he
showed
me
a
manuscript
open
on
the
table
and
told
me
in
a
more
serious
tone
here
professor
aronnax
is
a
manuscript
written
in
several
languages
it
contains
a
summary
of
my
research
under
the
sea
and
god
willing
it
wont
perish
with
me
signed
with
my
name
complete
with
my
life
story
this
manuscript
will
be
enclosed
in
a
small
unsinkable
contrivance
the
last
surviving
man
on
the
nautilus
will
throw
this
contrivance
into
the
sea
and
it
will
go
wherever
the
waves
carry
it
the
mans
name
his
life
story
written
by
himself
so
the
secret
of
his
existence
might
someday
be
unveiled
but
just
then
i
saw
this
announcement
only
as
a
leadin
to
my
topic
captain
i
replied
im
all
praise
for
this
idea
youre
putting
into
effect
the
fruits
of
your
research
must
not
be
lost
but
the
methods
youre
using
strike
me
as
primitive
who
knows
where
the
winds
will
take
that
contrivance
into
whose
hands
it
may
fall
cant
you
find
something
better
cant
you
or
one
of
your
men
never
sir
the
captain
said
swiftly
interrupting
me
but
my
companions
and
i
would
be
willing
to
safeguard
this
manuscript
and
if
you
give
us
back
our
freedom
your
freedom
captain
nemo
put
in
standing
up
yes
sir
and
thats
the
subject
on
which
i
wanted
to
confer
with
you
for
seven
months
weve
been
aboard
your
vessel
and
i
ask
you
today
in
the
name
of
my
companions
as
well
as
myself
if
you
intend
to
keep
us
here
forever
professor
aronnax
captain
nemo
said
ill
answer
you
today
just
as
i
did
seven
months
ago
whoever
boards
the
nautilus
must
never
leave
it
what
youre
inflicting
on
us
is
outright
slavery
call
it
anything
you
like
but
every
slave
has
the
right
to
recover
his
freedom
by
any
worthwhile
available
means
who
has
denied
you
that
right
captain
nemo
replied
did
i
ever
try
to
bind
you
with
your
word
of
honor
the
captain
stared
at
me
crossing
his
arms
sir
i
told
him
to
take
up
this
subject
a
second
time
would
be
distasteful
to
both
of
us
so
lets
finish
what
weve
started
i
repeat
it
isnt
just
for
myself
that
i
raise
this
issue
to
me
research
is
a
relief
a
potent
diversion
an
enticement
a
passion
that
can
make
me
forget
everything
else
like
you
im
a
man
neglected
and
unknown
living
in
the
faint
hope
that
someday
i
can
pass
on
to
future
generations
the
fruits
of
my
laborsfiguratively
speaking
by
means
of
some
contrivance
left
to
the
luck
of
winds
and
waves
in
short
i
can
admire
you
and
comfortably
go
with
you
while
playing
a
role
i
only
partly
understand
but
i
still
catch
glimpses
of
other
aspects
of
your
life
that
are
surrounded
by
involvements
and
secrets
that
alone
on
board
my
companions
and
i
cant
share
and
even
when
our
hearts
could
beat
with
yours
moved
by
some
of
your
griefs
or
stirred
by
your
deeds
of
courage
and
genius
weve
had
to
stifle
even
the
slightest
token
of
that
sympathy
that
arises
at
the
sight
of
something
fine
and
good
whether
it
comes
from
friend
or
enemy
all
right
then
its
this
feeling
of
being
alien
to
your
deepest
concerns
that
makes
our
situation
unacceptable
impossible
even
impossible
for
me
but
especially
for
ned
land
every
man
by
virtue
of
his
very
humanity
deserves
fair
treatment
have
you
considered
how
a
love
of
freedom
and
hatred
of
slavery
could
lead
to
plans
of
vengeance
in
a
temperament
like
the
canadians
what
he
might
think
attempt
endeavor




i
fell
silent
captain
nemo
stood
up
ned
land
can
think
attempt
or
endeavor
anything
he
wants
what
difference
is
it
to
me
i
didnt
go
looking
for
him
i
dont
keep
him
on
board
for
my
pleasure
as
for
you
professor
aronnax
youre
a
man
able
to
understand
anything
even
silence
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
let
this
first
time
youve
come
to
discuss
this
subject
also
be
the
last
because
a
second
time
i
wont
even
listen
i
withdrew
from
that
day
forward
our
position
was
very
strained
i
reported
this
conversation
to
my
two
companions
now
we
know
ned
said
that
we
cant
expect
a
thing
from
this
man
the
nautilus
is
nearing
long
island
well
escape
no
matter
what
the
weather
but
the
skies
became
more
and
more
threatening
there
were
conspicuous
signs
of
a
hurricane
on
the
way
the
atmosphere
was
turning
white
and
milky
slender
sheaves
of
cirrus
clouds
were
followed
on
the
horizon
by
layers
of
nimbocumulus
other
low
clouds
fled
swiftly
the
sea
grew
towering
inflated
by
long
swells
every
bird
had
disappeared
except
a
few
petrels
friends
of
the
storms
the
barometer
fell
significantly
indicating
a
tremendous
tension
in
the
surrounding
haze
the
mixture
in
our
stormglass
decomposed
under
the
influence
of
the
electricity
charging
the
air
a
struggle
of
the
elements
was
approaching
the
storm
burst
during
the
daytime
of
may
13
just
as
the
nautilus
was
cruising
abreast
of
long
island
a
few
miles
from
the
narrows
to
upper
new
york
bay
im
able
to
describe
this
struggle
of
the
elements
because
captain
nemo
didnt
flee
into
the
ocean
depths
instead
from
some
inexplicable
whim
he
decided
to
brave
it
out
on
the
surface
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
southwest
initially
a
stiff
breeze
in
other
words
with
a
speed
of
fifteen
meters
per
second
which
built
to
twentyfive
meters
near
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
this
is
the
figure
for
major
storms
unshaken
by
these
squalls
captain
nemo
stationed
himself
on
the
platform
he
was
lashed
around
the
waist
to
withstand
the
monstrous
breakers
foaming
over
the
deck
i
hoisted
and
attached
myself
to
the
same
place
dividing
my
wonderment
between
the
storm
and
this
incomparable
man
who
faced
it
headon
the
raging
sea
was
swept
with
huge
tattered
clouds
drenched
by
the
waves
i
saw
no
more
of
the
small
intervening
billows
that
form
in
the
troughs
of
the
big
crests
just
long
sootcolored
undulations
with
crests
so
compact
they
didnt
foam
they
kept
growing
taller
they
were
spurring
each
other
on
the
nautilus
sometimes
lying
on
its
side
sometimes
standing
on
end
like
a
mast
rolled
and
pitched
frightfully
near
five
oclock
a
torrential
rain
fell
but
it
lulled
neither
wind
nor
sea
the
hurricane
was
unleashed
at
a
speed
of
fortyfive
meters
per
second
hence
almost
forty
leagues
per
hour
under
these
conditions
houses
topple
roof
tiles
puncture
doors
iron
railings
snap
in
two
and
twentyfourpounder
cannons
relocate
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
this
turmoil
the
nautilus
lived
up
to
that
saying
of
an
expert
engineer
a
wellconstructed
hull
can
defy
any
sea
this
submersible
was
no
resisting
rock
that
waves
could
demolish
it
was
a
steel
spindle
obediently
in
motion
without
rigging
or
masting
and
able
to
brave
their
fury
with
impunity
meanwhile
i
was
carefully
examining
these
unleashed
breakers
they
measured
up
to
fifteen
meters
in
height
over
a
length
of
150
to
175
meters
and
the
speed
of
their
propagation
half
that
of
the
wind
was
fifteen
meters
per
second
their
volume
and
power
increased
with
the
depth
of
the
waters
i
then
understood
the
role
played
by
these
waves
which
trap
air
in
their
flanks
and
release
it
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
where
its
oxygen
brings
life
their
utmost
pressureit
has
been
calculatedcan
build
to
3000
kilograms
on
every
square
foot
of
surface
they
strike
it
was
such
waves
in
the
hebrides
that
repositioned
a
stone
block
weighing
84000
pounds
it
was
their
relatives
in
the
tidal
wave
on
december
23
1854
that
toppled
part
of
the
japanese
city
of
tokyo
then
went
that
same
day
at
700
kilometers
per
hour
to
break
on
the
beaches
of
america
after
nightfall
the
storm
grew
in
intensity
as
in
the
1860
cyclone
on
runion
island
the
barometer
fell
to
710
millimeters
at
the
close
of
day
i
saw
a
big
ship
passing
on
the
horizon
struggling
painfully
it
lay
to
at
half
steam
in
an
effort
to
hold
steady
on
the
waves
it
must
have
been
a
steamer
on
one
of
those
lines
out
of
new
york
to
liverpool
or
le
havre
it
soon
vanished
into
the
shadows
at
ten
oclock
in
the
evening
the
skies
caught
on
fire
the
air
was
streaked
with
violent
flashes
of
lightning
i
couldnt
stand
this
brightness
but
captain
nemo
stared
straight
at
it
as
if
to
inhale
the
spirit
of
the
storm
a
dreadful
noise
filled
the
air
a
complicated
noise
made
up
of
the
roar
of
crashing
breakers
the
howl
of
the
wind
claps
of
thunder
the
wind
shifted
to
every
point
of
the
horizon
and
the
cyclone
left
the
east
to
return
there
after
passing
through
north
west
and
south
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
of
revolving
storms
in
the
southern
hemisphere
oh
that
gulf
stream
it
truly
lives
up
to
its
nickname
the
lord
of
storms
all
by
itself
it
creates
these
fearsome
cyclones
through
the
difference
in
temperature
between
its
currents
and
the
superimposed
layers
of
air
the
rain
was
followed
by
a
downpour
of
fire
droplets
of
water
changed
into
exploding
tufts
you
would
have
thought
captain
nemo
was
courting
a
death
worthy
of
himself
seeking
to
be
struck
by
lightning
in
one
hideous
pitching
movement
the
nautilus
reared
its
steel
spur
into
the
air
like
a
lightning
rod
and
i
saw
long
sparks
shoot
down
it
shattered
at
the
end
of
my
strength
i
slid
flat
on
my
belly
to
the
hatch
i
opened
it
and
went
below
to
the
lounge
by
then
the
storm
had
reached
its
maximum
intensity
it
was
impossible
to
stand
upright
inside
the
nautilus
captain
nemo
reentered
near
midnight
i
could
hear
the
ballast
tanks
filling
little
by
little
and
the
nautilus
sank
gently
beneath
the
surface
of
the
waves
through
the
lounges
open
windows
i
saw
large
frightened
fish
passing
like
phantoms
in
the
fiery
waters
some
were
struck
by
lightning
right
before
my
eyes
the
nautilus
kept
descending
i
thought
it
would
find
calm
again
at
fifteen
meters
down
no
the
upper
strata
were
too
violently
agitated
it
needed
to
sink
to
fifty
meters
searching
for
a
resting
place
in
the
bowels
of
the
sea
but
once
there
what
tranquility
we
found
what
silence
what
peace
all
around
us
who
would
have
known
that
a
dreadful
hurricane
was
then
unleashed
on
the
surface
of
this
ocean

in
the
aftermath
of
this
storm
we
were
thrown
back
to
the
east
away
went
any
hope
of
escaping
to
the
landing
places
of
new
york
or
the
st
lawrence
in
despair
poor
ned
went
into
seclusion
like
captain
nemo
conseil
and
i
no
longer
left
each
other
as
i
said
the
nautilus
veered
to
the
east
to
be
more
accurate
i
should
have
said
to
the
northeast
sometimes
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
sometimes
beneath
them
the
ship
wandered
for
days
amid
these
mists
so
feared
by
navigators
these
are
caused
chiefly
by
melting
ice
which
keeps
the
air
extremely
damp
how
many
ships
have
perished
in
these
waterways
as
they
tried
to
get
directions
from
the
hazy
lights
on
the
coast
how
many
casualties
have
been
caused
by
these
opaque
mists
how
many
collisions
have
occurred
with
these
reefs
where
the
breaking
surf
is
covered
by
the
noise
of
the
wind
how
many
vessels
have
rammed
each
other
despite
their
running
lights
despite
the
warnings
given
by
their
bosuns
pipes
and
alarm
bells
so
the
floor
of
this
sea
had
the
appearance
of
a
battlefield
where
every
ship
defeated
by
the
ocean
still
lay
some
already
old
and
encrusted
others
newer
and
reflecting
our
beacon
light
on
their
ironwork
and
copper
undersides
among
these
vessels
how
many
went
down
with
all
hands
with
their
crews
and
hosts
of
immigrants
at
these
trouble

we
were
off
the
southern
tip
of
the
grand
banks
of
newfoundland
these
banks
are
the
result
of

extensive
accumulation
of
organic
waste
brought
either
from
the

by
the

from

it
loses
its

but
it
turns
into
a

among
the

that
the

startled
on
its

mercy
look
at
these
cod
he
said
why
i
thought
cod
were
flat
like
dab
or
sole
innocent
boy
i
exclaimed
cod
are
flat
only
at
the
grocery
store
where
theyre
cut
open
and
spread
out
on
display
but
in
the

theyre
like
mullet
spindleshaped
and
perfectly
built
for
speed
i
can
easily
believe
master

what
crowds
of
them
what
swarms
bah
my

thered
be
many
more
without
their
enemies
scorpionfish

human

do
you
know
how
many

my

i
refuse
to

that
until
i
count
them
myself
so
count
them

it
would
be
less

to

me
besides
frenchmen

catch
these

fertility
of
these
fish
the
seas
would
soon
be
depopulated
of
them
accordingly
in
england
and
america
alone
5000
ships
manned
by
75000
seamen
go
after
cod
each
ship
brings
back
an
average
catch
of
4400

making
22000000
off
the
coast
of

the

conseil
replied
ill
take
masters
word
for
it
i
wont
count
them
count
what
those
11000000
eggs
but
ill
make
one
comment
whats
that
if
all
their
eggs
hatched
just
four
codfish
could
feed
england
america
and
norway
as
we
skimmed
the
depths
of
the
grand
banks
i
could
see
perfectly
those
long
fishing
lines
each
armed
with
200
hooks
that
every
boat
dangled
by
the
dozens
the
lower
end
of
each
line
dragged
the
bottom
by
means
of
a
small
grappling
iron
and
at
the
surface
it
was
secured
to
the
buoyrope
of
a
cork
float
the
nautilus
had
to
maneuver
shrewdly
in
the
midst
of
this
underwater
spiderweb
but
the
ship
didnt
stay
long
in
these
heavily
traveled
waterways
it
went
up
to
about
latitude
42
degrees
this
brought
it
abreast
of
st
johns
in
newfoundland
and
hearts
content
where
the
atlantic
cable
reaches
its
end
point
instead
of
continuing
north
the
nautilus
took
an
easterly
heading
as
if
to
go
along
this
plateau
on
which
the
telegraph
cable
rests
where
multiple
soundings
have
given
the
contours
of
the
terrain
with
the
utmost
accuracy
it
was
on
may
17
about
500
miles
from
hearts
content
and
2800
meters
down
that
i
spotted
this
cable
lying
on
the
seafloor
conseil
whom
i
hadnt
alerted
mistook
it
at
first
for
a
gigantic
sea
snake
and
was
gearing
up
to
classify
it
in
his
best
manner
but
i
enlightened
the
fine
lad
and
let
him
down
gently
by
giving
him
various
details
on
the
laying
of
this
cable
the
first
cable
was
put
down
during
the
years
18571858
but
after
transmitting
about
400
telegrams
it
went
dead
in
1863
engineers
built
a
new
cable
that
measured
3400
kilometers
weighed
4500
metric
tons
and
was
shipped
aboard
the
great
eastern
this
attempt
also
failed
now
then
on
may
25
while
submerged
to
a
depth
of
3836
meters
the
nautilus
lay
in
precisely
the
locality
where
this
second
cable
suffered
the
rupture
that
ruined
the
undertaking
it
happened
638
miles
from
the
coast
of
ireland
at
around
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
all
contact
with
europe
broke
off
the
electricians
on
board
decided
to
cut
the
cable
before
fishing
it
up
and
by
eleven
oclock
that
evening
they
had
retrieved
the
damaged
part
they
repaired
the
joint
and
its
splice
then
the
cable
was
resubmerged
but
a
few
days
later
it
snapped
again
and
couldnt
be
recovered
from
the
ocean
depths
these
americans
refused
to
give
up
the
daring
cyrus
field
who
had
risked
his
whole
fortune
to
promote
this
undertaking
called
for
a
new
bond
issue
it
sold
out
immediately
another
cable
was
put
down
under
better
conditions
its
sheaves
of
conducting
wire
were
insulated
within
a
guttapercha
covering
which
was
protected
by
a
padding
of
textile
material
enclosed
in
a
metal
sheath
the
great
eastern
put
back
to
sea
on
july
13
1866
the
operation
proceeded
apace
yet
there
was
one
hitch
as
they
gradually
unrolled
this
third
cable
the
electricians
observed
on
several
occasions
that
someone
had
recently
driven
nails
into
it
trying
to
damage
its
core
captain
anderson
his
officers
and
the
engineers
put
their
heads
together
then
posted
a
warning
that
if
the
culprit
were
detected
he
would
be
thrown
overboard
without
a
trial
after
that
these
villainous
attempts
were
not
repeated
by
july
23
the
great
eastern
was
lying
no
farther
than
800
kilometers
from
newfoundland
when
it
received
telegraphed
news
from
ireland
of
an
armistice
signed
between
prussia
and
austria
after
the
battle
of
sadova
through
the
mists
on
the
27th
it
sighted
the
port
of
hearts
content
the
undertaking
had
ended
happily
and
in
its
first
dispatch
young
america
addressed
old
europe
with
these
wise
words
so
rarely
understood
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
and
peace
on
earth
to
men
of
good
will
i
didnt
expect
to
find
this
electric
cable
in
mint
condition
as
it
looked
on
leaving
its
place
of
manufacture
the
long
snake
was
covered
with
seashell
rubble
and
bristling
with
foraminifera
a
crust
of
caked
gravel
protected
it
from
any
mollusks
that
might
bore
into
it
it
rested
serenely
sheltered
from
the
seas
motions
under
a
pressure
favorable
to
the
transmission
of
that
electric
spark
that
goes
from
america
to
europe
in
32100
of
a
second
this
cable
will
no
doubt
last
indefinitely
because
as
observers
note
its
guttapercha
casing
is
improved
by
a
stay
in
salt
water
besides
on
this
wellchosen
plateau
the
cable
never
lies
at
depths
that
could
cause
a
break
the
nautilus
followed
it
to
its
lowest
reaches
located
4431
meters
down
and
even
there
it
rested
without
any
stress
or
strain
then
we
returned
to
the
locality
where
the
1863
accident
had
taken
place
there
the
ocean
floor
formed
a
valley
120
kilometers
wide
into
which
you
could
fit
mt
blanc
without
its
summit
poking
above
the
surface
of
the
waves
this
valley
is
closed
off
to
the
east
by
a
sheer
wall
2000
meters
high
we
arrived
there
on
may
28
and
the
nautilus
lay
no
farther
than
150
kilometers
from
ireland
would
captain
nemo
head
up
north
and
beach
us
on
the
british
isles
no
much
to
my
surprise
he
went
back
down
south
and
returned
to
european
seas
as
we
swung
around
the
emerald
isle
i
spotted
cape
clear
for
an
instant
plus
the
lighthouse
on
fastnet
rock
that
guides
all
those
thousands
of
ships
setting
out
from
glasgow
or
liverpool
an
important
question
then
popped
into
my
head
would
the
nautilus
dare
to
tackle
the
english
channel
ned
land
who
promptly
reappeared
after
we
hugged
shore
never
stopped
questioning
me
what
could
i
answer
him
captain
nemo
remained
invisible
after
giving
the
canadian
a
glimpse
of
american
shores
was
he
about
to
show
me
the
coast
of
france
but
the
nautilus
kept
gravitating
southward
on
may
30
in
sight
of
lands
end
it
passed
between
the
lowermost
tip
of
england
and
the
scilly
islands
which
it
left
behind
to
starboard
if
it
was
going
to
enter
the
english
channel
it
clearly
needed
to
head
east
it
did
not
all
day
long
on
may
31
the
nautilus
swept
around
the
sea
in
a
series
of
circles
that
had
me
deeply
puzzled
it
seemed
to
be
searching
for
a
locality
that
it
had
some
trouble
finding
at
noon
captain
nemo
himself
came
to
take
our
bearings
he
didnt
address
a
word
to
me
he
looked
gloomier
than
ever
what
was
filling
him
with
such
sadness
was
it
our
proximity
to
these
european
shores
was
he
reliving
his
memories
of
that
country
he
had
left
behind
if
so
what
did
he
feel
remorse
or
regret
for
a
good
while
these
thoughts
occupied
my
mind
and
i
had
a
hunch
that
fate
would
soon
give
away
the
captains
secrets
the
next
day
june
1
the
nautilus
kept
to
the
same
tack
it
was
obviously
trying
to
locate
some
precise
spot
in
the
ocean
just
as
on
the
day
before
captain
nemo
came
to
take
the
altitude
of
the
sun
the
sea
was
smooth
the
skies
clear
eight
miles
to
the
east
a
big
steamship
was
visible
on
the
horizon
line
no
flag
was
flapping
from
the
gaff
of
its
foreandaft
sail
and
i
couldnt
tell
its
nationality
a
few
minutes
before
the
sun
passed
its
zenith
captain
nemo
raised
his
sextant
and
took
his
sights
with
the
utmost
precision
the
absolute
calm
of
the
waves
facilitated
this
operation
the
nautilus
lay
motionless
neither
rolling
nor
pitching
i
was
on
the
platform
just
then
after
determining
our
position
the
captain
pronounced
only
these
words
its
right
here
he
went
down
the
hatch
had
he
seen
that
vessel
change
course
and
seemingly
head
toward
us
im
unable
to
say
i
returned
to
the
lounge
the
hatch
closed
and
i
heard
water
hissing
in
the
ballast
tanks
the
nautilus
began
to
sink
on
a
vertical
line
because
its
propeller
was
in
check
and
no
longer
furnished
any
forward
motion
some
minutes
later
it
stopped
at
a
depth
of
833
meters
and
came
to
rest
on
the
seafloor
the
ceiling
lights
in
the
lounge
then
went
out
the
panels
opened
and
through
the
windows
i
saw
for
a
halfmile
radius
the
sea
brightly
lit
by
the
beacons
rays
i
looked
to
port
and
saw
nothing
but
the
immenseness
of
these
tranquil
waters
to
starboard
a
prominent
bulge
on
the
sea
bottom
caught
my
attention
you
would
have
thought
it
was
some
ruin
enshrouded
in
a
crust
of
whitened
seashells
as
if
under
a
mantle
of
snow
carefully
examining
this
mass
i
could
identify
the
swollen
outlines
of
a
ship
shorn
of
its
masts
which
must
have
sunk
bow
first
this
casualty
certainly
dated
from
some
faroff
time
to
be
so
caked
with
the
limestone
of
these
waters
this
wreckage
must
have
spent
many
a
year
on
the
ocean
floor
what
ship
was
this
why
had
the
nautilus
come
to
visit
its
grave
was
it
something
other
than
a
maritime
accident
that
had
dragged
this
craft
under
the
waters
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
but
next
to
me
i
heard
captain
nemos
voice
slowly
say
originally
this
ship
was
christened
the
marseillais
it
carried
seventyfour
cannons
and
was
launched
in
1762
on
august
13
1778
commanded
by
la
poypevertrieux
it
fought
valiantly
against
the
preston
on
july
4
1779
as
a
member
of
the
squadron
under

it
assisted
in
the
capture
of
the
island
of
grenada
on
september
5
1781
under
the
count
de
grasse
it
took
part
in
the
battle
of
chesapeake
bay
in
1794
the
new
republic
of
france
changed
the
name
of
this
ship
on
april
16
of
that
same
year
it
joined
the
squadron
at
brest
under
rear

villaret
de

who
was
entrusted
with
escorting
a
convoy
of
wheat
coming
from
america
under
the
command
of

11th
and

days
in

spot
in
latitude

and
longitude
17

this
ship
sank
after
a
heroic
battle
its
three
masts
gone
water
in
its
hold
a
third
of
its
crew
out
of
action
it
preferred
to
go
to
the
bottom
with
its
356
seamen
rather
than
surrender
and
with
its
flag
nailed
up
on
the
afterdeck
it
disappeared
beneath
the
waves
to
shouts
of
long
live
the
republic
this
is
the
avenger
i
exclaimed
yes
sir
the
avenger
a
splendid
name
captain
nemo
murmured
crossing
his
arms
chapter
21
a
mass
execution
the
way
he
said
this
the
unexpectedness
of
this
scene
first
the
biography
of
this
patriotic
ship
then
the
excitement
with
which
this
eccentric
individual
pronounced
these
last
wordsthe
name
avenger
whose
significance
could
not
escape
meall
this
taken
together
had
a
profound
impact
on
my
mind
my
eyes
never
left
the
captain
hands
outstretched
toward
the
sea
he
contemplated
the
proud
wreck
with
blazing
eyes
perhaps
i
would
never
learn
who
he
was
where
he
came
from
or
where
he
was
heading
but
more
and
more
i
could
see
a
distinction
between
the
man
and
the
scientist
it
was
no
ordinary
misanthropy
that
kept
captain
nemo
and
his
companions
sequestered
inside
the
nautiluss
plating
but
a
hate
so
monstrous
or
so
sublime
that
the
passing
years
could
never
weaken
it
did
this
hate
also
hunger
for
vengeance
time
would
soon
tell
meanwhile
the
nautilus
rose
slowly
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
i
watched
the
avengers
murky
shape
disappearing
little
by
little
soon
a
gentle
rolling
told
me
that
we
were
afloat
in
the
open
air
just
then
a
hollow
explosion
was
audible
i
looked
at
the
captain
the
captain
did
not
stir
captain
i
said
he
didnt
reply
i
left
him
and
climbed
onto
the
platform
conseil
and
the
canadian
were
already
there
what
caused
that
explosion
i
asked
a
cannon
going
off
ned
land
replied
i
stared
in
the
direction
of
the
ship
i
had
spotted
it
was
heading
toward
the
nautilus
and
you
could
tell
it
had
put
on
steam
six
miles
separated
it
from
us
what
sort
of
craft
is
it
ned
from
its
rigging
and
its
low
masts
the
canadian
replied
i
bet
its
a
warship
heres
hoping
it
pulls
up
and
sinks
this
damned
nautilus
ned
my
friend
conseil
replied
what
harm
could
it
do
the
nautilus
will
it
attack
us
under
the
waves
will
it
cannonade
us
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
tell
me
ned
i
asked
can
you
make
out
the
nationality
of
that
craft
creasing
his
brow
lowering
his
lids
and
puckering
the
corners
of
his
eyes
the
canadian
focused
the
full
power
of
his
gaze
on
the
ship
for
a
short
while
no
sir
he
replied
i
cant
make
out
what
nation
its
from
its
flying
no
flag
but
ill
swear
its
a
warship
because
theres
a
long
pennant
streaming
from
the
peak
of
its
mainmast
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
continued
to
watch
the
craft
bearing
down
on
us
but
it
was
inconceivable
to
me
that
it
had
discovered
the
nautilus
at
such
a
distance
still
less
that
it
knew
what
this
underwater
machine
really
was
soon
the
canadian
announced
that
the
craft
was
a
big
battleship
a
doubledecker
ironclad
complete
with
ram
dark
dense
smoke
burst
from
its
two
funnels
its
furled
sails
merged
with
the
lines
of
its
yardarms
the
gaff
of
its
foreandaft
sail
flew
no
flag
its
distance
still
kept
us
from
distinguishing
the
colors
of
its
pennant
which
was
fluttering
like
a
thin
ribbon
it
was
coming
on
fast
if
captain
nemo
let
it
approach
a
chance
for
salvation
might
be
available
to
us
sir
ned
land
told
me
if
that
boat
gets
within
a
mile
of
us
im
jumping
overboard
and
i
suggest
you
follow
suit
i
didnt
reply
to
the
canadians
proposition
but
kept
watching
the
ship
which
was
looming
larger
on
the
horizon
whether
it
was
english
french
american
or
russian
it
would
surely
welcome
us
aboard
if
we
could
just
get
to
it
master
may
recall
conseil
then
said
that
we
have
some
experience
with
swimming
he
can
rely
on
me
to
tow
him
to
that
vessel
if
hes
agreeable
to
going
with
our
friend
ned
before
i
could
reply
white
smoke
streamed
from
the
battleships
bow
then
a
few
seconds
later
the
waters
splashed
astern
of
the
nautilus
disturbed
by
the
fall
of
a
heavy
object
soon
after
an
explosion
struck
my
ears
whats
this
theyre
firing
at
us
i
exclaimed
good
lads
the
canadian
muttered
that
means
they
dont
see
us
as
castaways
clinging
to
some
wreckage
with
all
due
respect
to
mastergracious
conseil
put
in
shaking
off
the
water
that
had
sprayed
over
him
from
another
shell
with
all
due
respect
to
master
theyve
discovered
the
narwhale
and
theyre
cannonading
the
same
but
it
must
be
clear
to
them
i
exclaimed
that
theyre
dealing
with
human
beings
maybe
thats
why
ned
land
replied
staring
hard
at
me
the
full
truth
dawned
on
me
undoubtedly
people
now
knew
where
they
stood
on
the
existence
of
this
socalled
monster
undoubtedly
the
latters
encounter
with
the
abraham
lincoln
when
the
canadian
hit
it
with
his
harpoon
had
led
commander
farragut
to
recognize
the
narwhale
as
actually
an
underwater
boat
more
dangerous
than
any
unearthly
cetacean
yes
this
had
to
be
the
case
and
undoubtedly
they
were
now
chasing
this
dreadful
engine
of
destruction
on
every
sea
dreadful
indeed
if
as
we
could
assume
captain
nemo
had
been
using
the
nautilus
in
works
of
vengeance
that
night
in
the
middle
of
the
indian
ocean
when
he
imprisoned
us
in
the
cell
hadnt
he
attacked
some
ship
that
man
now
buried
in
the
coral
cemetery
wasnt
he
the
victim
of
some
collision
caused
by
the
nautilus
yes
i
repeat
this
had
to
be
the
case
one
part
of
captain
nemos
secret
life
had
been
unveiled
and
now
even
though
his
identity
was
still
unknown
at
least
the
nations
allied
against
him
knew
they
were
no
longer
hunting
some
fairytale
monster
but
a
man
who
had
sworn
an
implacable
hate
toward
them
this
whole
fearsome
sequence
of
events
appeared
in
my
minds
eye
instead
of
encountering
friends
on
this
approaching
ship
we
would
find
only
pitiless
enemies
meanwhile
shells
fell
around
us
in
increasing
numbers
some
meeting
the
liquid
surface
would
ricochet
and
vanish
into
the
sea
at
considerable
distances
but
none
of
them
reached
the
nautilus
by
then
the
ironclad
was
no
more
than
three
miles
off
despite
its
violent
cannonade
captain
nemo
hadnt
appeared
on
the
platform
and
yet
if
one
of
those
conical
shells
had
scored
a
routine
hit
on
the
nautiluss
hull
it
could
have
been
fatal
to
him
the
canadian
then
told
me
sir
weve
got
to
do
everything
we
can
to
get
out
of
this
jam
lets
signal
them
damnation
maybe
theyll
realize
were
decent
people
ned
land
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
to
wave
it
in
the
air
but
he
had
barely
unfolded
it
when
he
was
felled
by
an
iron
fist
and
despite
his
great
strength
he
tumbled
to
the
deck
scum
the
captain
shouted
do
you
want
to
be
nailed
to
the
nautiluss
spur
before
it
charges
that
ship
dreadful
to
hear
captain
nemo
was
even
more
dreadful
to
see
his
face
was
pale
from
some
spasm
of
his
heart
which
must
have
stopped
beating
for
an
instant
his
pupils
were
hideously
contracted
his
voice
was
no
longer
speaking
it
was
bellowing
bending
from
the
waist
he
shook
the
canadian
by
the
shoulders
then
dropping
ned
and
turning
to
the
battleship
whose
shells
were
showering
around
him
o
ship
of
an
accursed
nation
you
know
who
i
am
he
shouted
in
his
powerful
voice
and
i
dont
need
your
colors
to
recognize
you
look
ill
show
you
mine
and
in
the
bow
of
the
platform
captain
nemo
unfurled
a
black
flag
like
the
one
he
had
left
planted
at
the
south
pole
just
then
a
shell
hit
the
nautiluss
hull
obliquely
failed
to
breach
it
ricocheted
near
the
captain
and
vanished
into
the
sea
captain
nemo
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
addressing
me
go
below
he
told
me
in
a
curt
tone
you
and
your
companions
go
below
sir
i
exclaimed
are
you
going
to
attack
this
ship
sir
im
going
to
sink
it
you
wouldnt
i
will
captain
nemo
replied
icily
youre
illadvised
to
pass
judgment
on
me
sir
fate
has
shown
you
what
you
werent
meant
to
see
the
attack
has
come
our
reply
will
be
dreadful
get
back
inside
from
what
country
is
that
ship
you
dont
know
fine
so
much
the
better
at
least
its
nationality
will
remain
a
secret
to
you
go
below
the
canadian
conseil
and
i
could
only
obey
some
fifteen
of
the
nautiluss
seamen
surrounded
their
captain
and
stared
with
a
feeling
of
implacable
hate
at
the
ship
bearing
down
on
them
you
could
feel
the
same
spirit
of
vengeance
enkindling
their
every
soul
i
went
below
just
as
another
projectile
scraped
the
nautiluss
hull
and
i
heard
the
captain
exclaim
shoot
you
demented
vessel
shower
your
futile
shells
you
wont
escape
the
nautiluss
spur
but
this
isnt
the
place
where
youll
perish
i
dont
want
your
wreckage
mingling
with
that
of
the
avenger
i
repaired
to
my
stateroom
the
captain
and
his
chief
officer
stayed
on
the
platform
the
propeller
was
set
in
motion
the
nautilus
swiftly
retreated
putting
us
outside
the
range
of
the
vessels
shells
but
the
chase
continued
and
captain
nemo
was
content
to
keep
his
distance
near
four
oclock
in
the
afternoon
unable
to
control
the
impatience
and
uneasiness
devouring
me
i
went
back
to
the
central
companionway
the
hatch
was
open
i
ventured
onto
the
platform
the
captain
was
still
strolling
there
his
steps
agitated
he
stared
at
the
ship
which
stayed
to
his
leeward
five
or
six
miles
off
he
was
circling
it
like
a
wild
beast
drawing
it
eastward
letting
it
chase
after
him
yet
he
didnt
attack
was
he
perhaps
still
undecided
i
tried
to
intervene
one
last
time
but
i
had
barely
queried
captain
nemo
when
the
latter
silenced
me
im
the
law
im
the
tribunal
im
the
oppressed
and
there
are
my
oppressors
thanks
to
them
ive
witnessed
the
destruction
of
everything
i
loved
cherished
and
veneratedhomeland
wife
children
father
and
mother
there
lies
everything
i
hate
not
another
word
out
of
you
i
took
a
last
look
at
the
battleship
which
was
putting
on
steam
then
i
rejoined
ned
and
conseil
well
escape
i
exclaimed
good
ned
put
in
wheres
that
ship
from
ive
no
idea
but
wherever
its
from
it
will
sink
before
nightfall
in
any
event
its
better
to
perish
with
it
than
be
accomplices
in
some
act
of
revenge
whose
merits
we
cant
gauge
thats
my
feeling
ned
land
replied
coolly
lets
wait
for
nightfall
night
fell
a
profound
silence
reigned
on
board
the
compass
indicated
that
the
nautilus
hadnt
changed
direction
i
could
hear
the
beat
of
its
propeller
churning
the
waves
with
steady
speed
staying
on
the
surface
of
the
water
it
rolled
gently
sometimes
to
one
side
sometimes
to
the
other
my
companions
and
i
had
decided
to
escape
as
soon
as
the
vessel
came
close
enough
for
us
to
be
heardor
seen
because
the
moon
would
wax
full
in
three
days
and
was
shining
brightly
once
we
were
aboard
that
ship
if
we
couldnt
ward
off
the
blow
that
threatened
it
at
least
we
could
do
everything
that
circumstances
permitted
several
times
i
thought
the
nautilus
was
about
to
attack
but
it
was
content
to
let
its
adversary
approach
and
then
it
would
quickly
resume
its
retreating
ways
part
of
the
night
passed
without
incident
we
kept
watch
for
an
opportunity
to
take
action
we
talked
little
being
too
keyed
up
ned
land
was
all
for
jumping
overboard
i
forced
him
to
wait
as
i
saw
it
the
nautilus
would
attack
the
doubledecker
on
the
surface
of
the
waves
and
then
it
would
be
not
only
possible
but
easy
to
escape
at
three
oclock
in
the
morning
full
of
uneasiness
i
climbed
onto
the
platform
captain
nemo
hadnt
left
it
he
stood
in
the
bow
next
to
his
flag
which
a
mild
breeze
was
unfurling
above
his
head
his
eyes
never
left
that
vessel
the
extraordinary
intensity
of
his
gaze
seemed
to
attract
it
beguile
it
and
draw
it
more
surely
than
if
he
had
it
in
tow
the
moon
then
passed
its
zenith
jupiter
was
rising
in
the
east
in
the
midst
of
this
placid
natural
setting
sky
and
ocean
competed
with
each
other
in
tranquility
and
the
sea
offered
the
orb
of
night
the
loveliest
mirror
ever
to
reflect
its
image
and
when
i
compared
this
deep
calm
of
the
elements
with
all
the
fury
seething
inside
the
plating
of
this
barely
perceptible
nautilus
i
shivered
all
over
the
vessel
was
two
miles
off
it
drew
nearer
always
moving
toward
the
phosphorescent
glow
that
signaled
the
nautiluss
presence
i
saw
its
green
and
red
running
lights
plus
the
white
lantern
hanging
from
the
large
stay
of
its
foremast
hazy
flickerings
were
reflected
on
its
rigging
and
indicated
that
its
furnaces
were
pushed
to
the
limit
showers
of
sparks
and
cinders
of
flaming
coal
escaped
from
its
funnels
spangling
the
air
with
stars
i
stood
there
until
six
oclock
in
the
morning
captain
nemo
never
seeming
to
notice
me
the
vessel
lay
a
mile
and
a
half
off
and
with
the
first
glimmers
of
daylight
it
resumed
its
cannonade
the
time
couldnt
be
far
away
when
the
nautilus
would
attack
its
adversary
and
my
companions
and
i
would
leave
forever
this
man
i
dared
not
judge
i
was
about
to
go
below
to
alert
them
when
the
chief
officer
climbed
onto
the
platform
several
seamen
were
with
him
captain
nemo
didnt
see
them
or
didnt
want
to
see
them
they
carried
out
certain
procedures
that
on
the
nautilus
you
could
call
clearing
the
decks
for
action
they
were
quite
simple
the
manropes
that
formed
a
handrail
around
the
platform
were
lowered
likewise
the
pilothouse
and
the
beacon
housing
were
withdrawn
into
the
hull
until
they
lay
exactly
flush
with
it
the
surface
of
this
long
sheetiron
cigar
no
longer
offered
a
single
protrusion
that
could
hamper
its
maneuvers
i
returned
to
the
lounge
the
nautilus
still
emerged
above
the
surface
a
few
morning
gleams
infiltrated
the
liquid
strata
beneath
the
undulations
of
the
billows
the
windows
were
enlivened
by
the
blushing
of
the
rising
sun
that
dreadful
day
of
june
2
had
dawned
at
seven
oclock
the
log
told
me
that
the
nautilus
had
reduced
speed
i
realized
that
it
was
letting
the
warship
approach
moreover
the
explosions
grew
more
intensely
audible
shells
furrowed
the
water
around
us
drilling
through
it
with
an
odd
hissing
sound
my
friends
i
said
its
time
lets
shake
hands
and
may
god
be
with
us
ned
land
was
determined
conseil
calm
i
myself
nervous
and
barely
in
control
we
went
into
the
library
just
as
i
pushed
open
the
door
leading
to
the
well
of
the
central
companionway
i
heard
the
hatch
close
sharply
overhead
the
canadian
leaped
up
the
steps
but
i
stopped
him
a
wellknown
hissing
told
me
that
water
was
entering
the
ships
ballast
tanks
indeed
in
a
few
moments
the
nautilus
had
submerged
some
meters
below
the
surface
of
the
waves
i
understood
this
maneuver
it
was
too
late
to
take
action
the
nautilus
wasnt
going
to
strike
the
doubledecker
where
it
was
clad
in
impenetrable
iron
armor
but
below
its
waterline
where
the
metal
carapace
no
longer
protected
its
planking
we
were
prisoners
once
more
unwilling
spectators
at
the
performance
of
this
gruesome
drama
but
we
barely
had
time
to
think
taking
refuge
in
my
stateroom
we
stared
at
each
other
without
pronouncing
a
word
my
mind
was
in
a
total
daze
my
mental
processes
came
to
a
dead
stop
i
hovered
in
that
painful
state
that
predominates
during
the
period
of
anticipation
before
some
frightful
explosion
i
waited
i
listened
i
lived
only
through
my
sense
of
hearing
meanwhile
the
nautiluss
speed
had
increased
appreciably
so
it
was
gathering
momentum
its
entire
hull
was
vibrating
suddenly
i
let
out
a
yell
there
had
been
a
collision
but
it
was
comparatively
mild
i
could
feel
the
penetrating
force
of
the
steel
spur
i
could
hear
scratchings
and
scrapings
carried
away
with
its
driving
power
the
nautilus
had
passed
through
the
vessels
mass
like
a
sailmakers
needle
through
canvas
i
couldnt
hold
still
frantic
going
insane
i
leaped
out
of
my
stateroom
and
rushed
into
the
lounge
captain
nemo
was
there
mute
gloomy
implacable
he
was
staring
through
the
port
panel
an
enormous
mass
was
sinking
beneath
the
waters
and
the
nautilus
missing
none
of
its
death
throes
was
descending
into
the
depths
with
it
ten
meters
away
i
could
see
its
gaping
hull
into
which
water
was
rushing
with
a
sound
of
thunder
then
its
double
rows
of
cannons
and
railings
its
deck
was
covered
with
dark
quivering
shadows
the
water
was
rising
those
poor
men
leaped
up
into
the
shrouds
clung
to
the
masts
writhed
beneath
the
waters
it
was
a
human
anthill
that
an
invading
sea
had
caught
by
surprise
paralyzed
rigid
with
anguish
my
hair
standing
on
end
my
eyes
popping
out
of
my
head
short
of
breath
suffocating
speechless
i
staredi
too
i
was
glued
to
the
window
by
an
irresistible
allure
the
enormous
vessel
settled
slowly
following
it
down
the
nautilus
kept
watch
on
its
every
movement
suddenly
there
was
an
eruption
the
air
compressed
inside
the
craft
sent
its
decks
flying
as
if
the
powder
stores
had
been
ignited
the
thrust
of
the
waters
was
so
great
the
nautilus
swerved
away
the
poor
ship
then
sank
more
swiftly
its
mastheads
appeared
laden
with
victims
then
its
crosstrees
bending
under
clusters
of
men
finally
the
peak
of
its
mainmast
then
the
dark
mass
disappeared
and
with
it
a
crew
of
corpses
dragged
under
by
fearsome
eddies



i
turned
to
captain
nemo
this
dreadful
executioner
this
true
archangel
of
hate
was
still
staring
when
it
was
all
over
captain
nemo
headed
to
the
door
of
his
stateroom
opened
it
and
entered
i
followed
him
with
my
eyes
on
the
rear
paneling
beneath
the
portraits
of
his
heroes
i
saw
the
portrait
of
a
stillyouthful
woman
with
two
little
children
captain
nemo
stared
at
them
for
a
few
moments
stretched
out
his
arms
to
them
sank
to
his
knees
and
melted
into
sobs
chapter
22
the
last
words
of
captain
nemo
the
panels
closed
over
this
frightful
view
but
the
lights
didnt
go
on
in
the
lounge
inside
the
nautilus
all
was
gloom
and
silence
it
left
this
place
of
devastation
with
prodigious
speed
100
feet
beneath
the
waters
where
was
it
going
north
or
south
where
would
the
man
flee
after
this
horrible
act
of
revenge
i
reentered
my
stateroom
where
ned
and
conseil
were
waiting
silently
captain
nemo
filled
me
with
insurmountable
horror
whatever
he
had
once
suffered
at
the
hands
of
humanity
he
had
no
right
to
mete
out
such
punishment
he
had
made
me
if
not
an
accomplice
at
least
an
eyewitness
to
his
vengeance
even
this
was
intolerable
at
eleven
oclock
the
electric
lights
came
back
on
i
went
into
the
lounge
it
was
deserted
i
consulted
the
various
instruments
the
nautilus
was
fleeing
northward
at
a
speed
of
twentyfive
miles
per
hour
sometimes
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
sometimes
thirty
feet
beneath
it
after
our
position
had
been
marked
on
the
chart
i
saw
that
we
were
passing
into
the
mouth
of
the
english
channel
that
our
heading
would
take
us
to
the
northernmost
seas
with
incomparable
speed
i
could
barely
glimpse
the
swift
passing
of
longnose
sharks
hammerhead
sharks
spotted
dogfish
that
frequent
these
waters
big
eagle
rays
swarms
of
seahorse
looking
like
knights
on
a
chessboard
eels
quivering
like
fireworks
serpents
armies
of
crab
that
fled
obliquely
by
crossing
their
pincers
over
their
carapaces
finally
schools
of
porpoise
that
held
contests
of
speed
with
the
nautilus
but
by
this
point
observing
studying
and
classifying
were
out
of
the
question
by
evening
we
had
cleared
200
leagues
up
the
atlantic
shadows
gathered
and
gloom
overran
the
sea
until
the
moon
came
up
i
repaired
to
my
stateroom
i
couldnt
sleep
i
was
assaulted
by
nightmares
that
horrible
scene
of
destruction
kept
repeating
in
my
minds
eye
from
that
day
forward
who
knows
where
the
nautilus
took
us
in
the
north
atlantic
basin
always
at
incalculable
speed
always
amid
the
high
arctic
mists
did
it
call
at
the
capes
of
spitzbergen
or
the
shores
of
novaya
zemlya
did
it
visit
such
uncharted
seas
as
the
white
sea
the
kara
sea
the
gulf
of
ob
the
lyakhov
islands
or
those
unknown
beaches
on
the
siberian
coast
im
unable
to
say
i
lost
track
of
the
passing
hours
time
was
in
abeyance
on
the
ships
clocks
as
happens
in
the
polar
regions
it
seemed
that
night
and
day
no
longer
followed
their
normal
sequence
i
felt
myself
being
drawn
into
that
strange
domain
where
the
overwrought
imagination
of
edgar
allan
poe
was
at
home
like
his
fabled
arthur
gordon
pym
i
expected
any
moment
to
see
that
shrouded
human
figure
very
far
larger
in
its
proportions
than
any
dweller
among
men
thrown
across
the
cataract
that
protects
the
outskirts
of
the
pole
i
estimatebut
perhaps
im
mistakenthat
the
nautiluss
haphazard
course
continued
for
fifteen
or
twenty
days
and
im
not
sure
how
long
this
would
have
gone
on
without
the
catastrophe
that
ended
our
voyage
as
for
captain
nemo
he
was
no
longer
in
the
picture
as
for
his
chief
officer
the
same
applied
not
one
crewman
was
visible
for
a
single
instant
the
nautilus
cruised
beneath
the
waters
almost
continuously
when
it
rose
briefly
to
the
surface
to
renew
our
air
the
hatches
opened
and
closed
as
if
automated
no
more
positions
were
reported
on
the
world
map
i
didnt
know
where
we
were
ill
also
mention
that
the
canadian
at
the
end
of
his
strength
and
patience
made
no
further
appearances
conseil
couldnt
coax
a
single
word
out
of
him
and
feared
that
in
a
fit
of
delirium
while
under
the
sway
of
a
ghastly
homesickness
ned
would
kill
himself
so
he
kept
a
devoted
watch
on
his
friend
every
instant
you
can
appreciate
that
under
these
conditions
our
situation
had
become
untenable
one
morningwhose
date
im
unable
to
specifyi
was
slumbering
near
the
first
hours
of
daylight
a
painful
sickly
slumber
waking
up
i
saw
ned
land
leaning
over
me
and
i
heard
him
tell
me
in
a
low
voice
were
going
to
escape
i
sat
up
when
i
asked
tonight
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
supervision
left
on
the
nautilus
youd
think
a
total
daze
was
reigning
on
board
will
you
be
ready
sir
yes
where
are
we
in
sight
of
land
i
saw
it
through
the
mists
just
this
morning
twenty
miles
to
the
east
what
land
is
it
ive
no
idea
but
whatever
it
is
there
well
take
refuge
yes
ned
well
escape
tonight
even
if
the
sea
swallows
us
up
the
seas
rough
the
winds
blowing
hard
but
a
twentymile
run
in
the
nautiluss
nimble
longboat
doesnt
scare
me
unknown
to
the
crew
ive
stowed
some
food
and
flasks
of
water
inside
im
with
you
whats
more
the
canadian
added
if
they
catch
me
ill
defend
myself
ill
fight
to
the
death
then
well
die
together
ned
my
friend
my
mind
was
made
up
the
canadian
left
me
i
went
out
on
the
platform
where
i
could
barely
stand
upright
against
the
jolts
of
the
billows
the
skies
were
threatening
but
land
lay
inside
those
dense
mists
and
we
had
to
escape
not
a
single
day
or
even
a
single
hour
could
we
afford
to
lose
i
returned
to
the
lounge
dreading
yet
desiring
an
encounter
with
captain
nemo
wanting
yet
not
wanting
to
see
him
what
would
i
say
to
him
how
could
i
hide
the
involuntary
horror
he
inspired
in
me
no
it
was
best
not
to
meet
him
face
to
face
best
to
try
and
forget
him
and
yet




how
long
that
day
seemed
the
last
i
would
spend
aboard
the
nautilus
i
was
left
to
myself
ned
land
and
conseil
avoided
speaking
to
me
afraid
they
would
give
themselves
away
at
six
oclock
i
ate
supper
but
i
had
no
appetite
despite
my
revulsion
i
forced
it
down
wanting
to
keep
my
strength
up
at
630
ned
land
entered
my
stateroom
he
told
me
we
wont
see
each
other
again
before
we
go
at
ten
oclock
the
moon
wont
be
up
yet
well
take
advantage
of
the
darkness
come
to
the
skiff
conseil
and
i
will
be
inside
waiting
for
you
the
canadian
left
without
giving
me
time
to
answer
him
i
wanted
to
verify
the
nautiluss
heading
i
made
my
way
to
the
lounge
we
were
racing
northnortheast
with
frightful
speed
fifty
meters
down
i
took
one
last
look
at
the
natural
wonders
and
artistic
treasures
amassed
in
the
museum
this
unrivaled
collection
doomed
to
perish
someday
in
the
depths
of
the
seas
together
with
its
curator
i
wanted
to
establish
one
supreme
impression
in
my
mind
i
stayed
there
an
hour
basking
in
the
aura
of
the
ceiling
lights
passing
in
review
the
treasures
shining
in
their
glass
cases
then
i
returned
to
my
stateroom
there
i
dressed
in
sturdy
seafaring
clothes
i
gathered
my
notes
and
packed
them
tenderly
about
my
person
my
heart
was
pounding
mightily
i
couldnt
curb
its
pulsations
my
anxiety
and
agitation
would
certainly
have
given
me
away
if
captain
nemo
had
seen
me
what
was
he
doing
just
then
i
listened
at
the
door
to
his
stateroom
i
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
captain
nemo
was
inside
he
hadnt
gone
to
bed
with
his
every
movement
i
imagined
he
would
appear
and
ask
me
why
i
wanted
to
escape
i
felt
in
a
perpetual
state
of
alarm
my
imagination
magnified
this
sensation
the
feeling
became
so
acute
i
wondered
whether
it
wouldnt
be
better
to
enter
the
captains
stateroom
dare
him
face
to
face
brave
it
out
with
word
and
deed
it
was
an
insane
idea
fortunately
i
controlled
myself
and
stretched
out
on
the
bed
to
soothe
my
bodily
agitation
my
nerves
calmed
a
little
but
with
my
brain
so
aroused
i
did
a
swift
review
of
my
whole
existence
aboard
the
nautilus
every
pleasant
or
unpleasant
incident
that
had
crossed
my
path
since
i
went
overboard
from
the
abraham
lincoln
the
underwater
hunting
trip
the
torres
strait
our
running
aground
the
savages
of
papua
the
coral
cemetery
the
suez
passageway
the
island
of
santorini
the
cretan
diver
the
bay
of
vigo
atlantis
the
ice
bank
the
south
pole
our
imprisonment
in
the
ice
the
battle
with
the
devilfish
the
storm
in
the
gulf
stream
the
avenger
and
that
horrible
scene
of
the
vessel
sinking
with
its
crew




all
these
events
passed
before
my
eyes
like
backdrops
unrolling
upstage
in
a
theater
in
this
strange
setting
captain
nemo
then
grew
fantastically
his
features
were
accentuated
taking
on
superhuman
proportions
he
was
no
longer
my
equal
he
was
the
man
of
the
waters
the
spirit
of
the
seas
by
then
it
was
930
i
held
my
head
in
both
hands
to
keep
it
from
bursting
i
closed
my
eyes
i
no
longer
wanted
to
think
a
half
hour
still
to
wait
a
half
hour
of
nightmares
that
could
drive
me
insane
just
then
i
heard
indistinct
chords
from
the
organ
melancholy
harmonies
from
some
undefinable
hymn
actual
pleadings
from
a
soul
trying
to
sever
its
earthly
ties
i
listened
with
all
my
senses
at
once
barely
breathing
immersed
like
captain
nemo
in
this
musical
trance
that
was
drawing
him
beyond
the
bounds
of
this
world
then
a
sudden
thought
terrified
me
captain
nemo
had
left
his
stateroom
he
was
in
the
same
lounge
i
had
to
cross
in
order
to
escape
there
i
would
encounter
him
one
last
time
he
would
see
me
perhaps
speak
to
me
one
gesture
from
him
could
obliterate
me
a
single
word
shackle
me
to
his
vessel
even
so
ten
oclock
was
about
to
strike
it
was
time
to
leave
my
stateroom
and
rejoin
my
companions
i
dared
not
hesitate
even
if
captain
nemo
stood
before
me
i
opened
the
door
cautiously
but
as
it
swung
on
its
hinges
it
seemed
to
make
a
frightful
noise
this
noise
existed
perhaps
only
in
my
imagination
i
crept
forward
through
the
nautiluss
dark
gangways
pausing
after
each
step
to
curb
the
pounding
of
my
heart
i
arrived
at
the
corner
door
of
the
lounge
i
opened
it
gently
the
lounge
was
plunged
in
profound
darkness
chords
from
the
organ
were
reverberating
faintly
captain
nemo
was
there
he
didnt
see
me
even
in
broad
daylight
i
doubt
that
he
would
have
noticed
me
so
completely
was
he
immersed
in
his
trance
i
inched
over
the
carpet
avoiding
the
tiniest
bump
whose
noise
might
give
me
away
it
took
me
five
minutes
to
reach
the
door
at
the
far
end
which
led
into
the
library
i
was
about
to
open
it
when
a
gasp
from
captain
nemo
nailed
me
to
the
spot
i
realized
that
he
was
standing
up
i
even
got
a
glimpse
of
him
because
some
rays
of
light
from
the
library
had
filtered
into
the
lounge
he
was
coming
toward
me
arms
crossed
silent
not
walking
but
gliding
like
a
ghost
his
chest
was
heaving
swelling
with
sobs
and
i
heard
him
murmur
these
words
the
last
of
his
to
reach
my
ears
o
almighty
god
enough
enough
was
it
a
vow
of
repentance
that
had
just
escaped
from
this
mans
conscience




frantic
i
rushed
into
the
library
i
climbed
the
central
companionway
and
going
along
the
upper
gangway
i
arrived
at
the
skiff
i
went
through
the
opening
that
had
already
given
access
to
my
two
companions
lets
go
lets
go
i
exclaimed
right
away
the
canadian
replied
first
ned
land
closed
and
bolted
the
opening
cut
into
the
nautiluss
sheet
iron
using
the
monkey
wrench
he
had
with
him
after
likewise
closing
the
opening
in
the
skiff
the
canadian
began
to
unscrew
the
nuts
still
bolting
us
to
the
underwater
boat
suddenly
a
noise
from
the
ships
interior
became
audible
voices
were
answering
each
other
hurriedly
what
was
it
had
they
spotted
our
escape
i
felt
ned
land
sliding
a
dagger
into
my
hand
yes
i
muttered
we
know
how
to
die
the
canadian
paused
in
his
work
but
one
word
twenty
times
repeated
one
dreadful
word
told
me
the
reason
for
the
agitation
spreading
aboard
the
nautilus
we
werent
the
cause
of
the
crews
concern
maelstrom
maelstrom
they
were
shouting
the
maelstrom
could
a
more
frightening
name
have
rung
in
our
ears
under
more
frightening
circumstances
were
we
lying
in
the
dangerous
waterways
off
the
norwegian
coast
was
the
nautilus
being
dragged
into
this
whirlpool
just
as
the
skiff
was
about
to
detach
from
its
plating
as
you
know
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
the
waters
confined
between
the
faroe
and
lofoten
islands
rush
out
with
irresistible
violence
they
form
a
vortex
from
which
no
ship
has
ever
been
able
to
escape
monstrous
waves
race
together
from
every
point
of
the
horizon
they
form
a
whirlpool
aptly
called
the
oceans
navel
whose
attracting
power
extends
a
distance
of
fifteen
kilometers
it
can
suck
down
not
only
ships
but
whales
and
even
polar
bears
from
the
northernmost
regions
this
was
where
the
nautilus
had
been
sent
accidentallyor
perhaps
deliberatelyby
its
captain
it
was
sweeping
around
in
a
spiral
whose
radius
kept
growing
smaller
and
smaller
the
skiff
still
attached
to
the
ships
plating
was
likewise
carried
around
at
dizzying
speed
i
could
feel
us
whirling
i
was
experiencing
that
accompanying
nausea
that
follows
such
continuous
spinning
motions
we
were
in
dread
in
the
last
stages
of
sheer
horror
our
blood
frozen
in
our
veins
our
nerves
numb
drenched
in
cold
sweat
as
if
from
the
throes
of
dying
and
what
a
noise
around
our
frail
skiff
what
roars
echoing
from
several
miles
away
what
crashes
from
the
waters
breaking
against
sharp
rocks
on
the
seafloor
where
the
hardest
objects
are
smashed
where
tree
trunks
are
worn
down
and
worked
into
a
shaggy
fur
as
norwegians
express
it
what
a
predicament
we
were
rocking
frightfully
the
nautilus
defended
itself
like
a
human
being
its
steel
muscles
were
cracking
sometimes
it
stood
on
end
the
three
of
us
along
with
it
weve
got
to
hold
on
tight
ned
said
and
screw
the
nuts
down
again
if
we
can
stay
attached
to
the
nautilus
we
can
still
make
it




he
hadnt
finished
speaking
when
a
cracking
sound
occurred
the
nuts
gave
way
and
ripped
out
of
its
socket
the
skiff
was
hurled
like
a
stone
from
a
sling
into
the
midst
of
the
vortex
my
head
struck
against
an
iron
timber
and
with
this
violent
shock
i
lost
consciousness
chapter
23
conclusion
we
come
to
the
conclusion
of
this
voyage
under
the
seas
what
happened
that
night
how
the
skiff
escaped
from
the
maelstroms
fearsome
eddies
how
ned
land
conseil
and
i
got
out
of
that
whirlpool
im
unable
to
say
but
when
i
regained
consciousness
i
was
lying
in
a
fishermans
hut
on
one
of
the
lofoten
islands
my
two
companions
safe
and
sound
were
at
my
bedside
clasping
my
hands
we
embraced
each
other
heartily
just
now
we
cant
even
dream
of
returning
to
france
travel
between
upper
norway
and
the
south
is
limited
so
i
have
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
a
steamboat
that
provides
bimonthly
service
from
north
cape
so
it
is
here
among
these
gallant
people
who
have
taken
us
in
that
im
reviewing
my
narrative
of
these
adventures
it
is
accurate
not
a
fact
has
been
omitted
not
a
detail
has
been
exaggerated
its
the
faithful
record
of
this
inconceivable
expedition
into
an
element
now
beyond
human
reach
but
where
progress
will
someday
make
great
inroads
will
anyone
believe
me
i
dont
know
ultimately
its
unimportant
what
i
can
now
assert
is
that
ive
earned
the
right
to
speak
of
these
seas
beneath
which
in
less
than
ten
months
ive
cleared
20000
leagues
in
this
underwater
tour
of
the
world
that
has
shown
me
so
many
wonders
across
the
pacific
the
indian
ocean
the
red
sea
the
mediterranean
the
atlantic
the
southernmost
and
northernmost
seas
but
what
happened
to
the
nautilus
did
it
withstand
the
maelstroms
clutches
is
captain
nemo
alive
is
he
still
under
the
ocean
pursuing
his
frightful
program
of
revenge
or
did
he
stop
after
that
latest
mass
execution
will
the
waves
someday
deliver
that
manuscript
that
contains
his
full
life
story
will
i
finally
learn
the
mans
name
will
the
nationality
of
the
stricken
warship
tell
us
the
nationality
of
captain
nemo
i
hope
so
i
likewise
hope
that
his
powerful
submersible
has
defeated
the
sea
inside
its
most
dreadful
whirlpool
that
the
nautilus
has
survived
where
so
many
ships
have
perished
if
this
is
the
case
and
captain
nemo
still
inhabits
the
oceanhis
adopted
countrymay
the
hate
be
appeased
in
that
fierce
heart
may
the
contemplation
of
so
many
wonders
extinguish
the
spirit
of
vengeance
in
him
may
the
executioner
pass
away
and
the
scientist
continue
his
peaceful
exploration
of
the
seas
if
his
destiny
is
strange
its
also
sublime
havent
i
encompassed
it
myself
didnt
i
lead
ten
months
of
this
otherworldly
existence
thus
to
that
question
asked
6000
years
ago
in
the
book
of
ecclesiasteswho
can
fathom
