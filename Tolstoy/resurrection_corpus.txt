preface
opinions
about
tolstoy
and
his
work
differ
but
on
one
point
there
surely
might
be
unanimity
a
writer
of
worldwide
reputation
should
be
at
least
allowed
to
know
how
to
spell
his
own
name
why
should
any
one
insist
on
spelling
it
tolstoi
with
one
two
or
three
dots
over
the
i
when
he
himself
writes
it
tolstoy
the
only
reason
i
have
ever
heard
suggested
is
that
in
england
and
america
such
outlandish
views
are
attributed
to
him
that
an
outlandish
spelling
is
desirable
to
match
those
views
this
novel
written
in
the
rough
by
tolstoy
some
years
ago
and
founded
upon
an
actual
occurrence
was
completely
rewritten
by
him
during
the
last
year
and
a
half
and
all
the
proceeds
have
been
devoted
by
him
to
aiding
the
doukhobors
a
sect
who
were
persecuted
in
the
caucasus
especially
from
1895
to
1898
for
refusing
to
learn
war
about
seven
thousand
three
hundred
of
them
are
settled
in
canada
and
about
a
hundred
of
the
leaders
are
exiled
to
the
remote
parts
of
siberia
anything
i
may
receive
for
my
work
in
translating
the
book
will
go
to
the
same
cause
prevention
is
better
than
cure
and
i
would
rather
help
people
to
abstain
from
killing
and
wounding
each
other
than
devote
the
money
to
patch
up
their
wounds

in
prison
though
hundreds
of
thousands
had
done
their
very
best
to
disfigure
the
small
piece
of
land
on
which
they
were
crowded
together
by
paving
the
ground
with
stones
scraping
away
every
vestige
of
vegetation
cutting
down
the
trees
turning
away
birds
and
beasts
and
filling
the
air
with
the
smoke
of
naphtha
and
coal
still
spring
was
spring
even
in
the
town
the
sun
shone
warm
the
air
was
balmy
everywhere
where
it
did
not
get
scraped
away
the
grass
revived
and
sprang
up
between
the
pavingstones
as
well
as
on
the
narrow
strips
of
lawn
on
the
boulevards
the
birches
the
poplars
and
the
wild
cherry
unfolded
their
gummy
and
fragrant
leaves
the
limes
were
expanding
their
opening
buds
crows
sparrows
and
pigeons
filled
with
the
joy
of
spring
were
getting
their
nests
ready
the
flies
were
buzzing
along
the
walls
warmed
by
the
sunshine
all
were
glad
the
plants
the
birds
the
insects
and
the
children
but
men
grownup
men
and
women
did
not
leave
off
cheating
and
tormenting
themselves
and
each
other
it
was
not
this
spring
morning
men
thought
sacred
and
worthy
of
consideration
not
the
beauty
of
gods
world
given
for
a
joy
to
all
creatures
this
beauty
which
inclines
the
heart
to
peace
to
harmony
and
to
love
but
only
their
own
devices
for
enslaving
one
another
thus
in
the
prison
office
of
the
government
town
it
was
not
the
fact
that
men
and
animals
had
received
the
grace
and
gladness
of
spring
that
was
considered
sacred
and
important
but
that
a
notice
numbered
and
with
a
superscription
had
come
the
day
before
ordering
that
on
this
28th
day
of
april
at
9
am
three
prisoners
at
present
detained
in
the
prison
a
man
and
two
women
one
of
these
women
as
the
chief
criminal
to
be
conducted
separately
had
to
appear
at
court
so
now
on
the
28th
of
april
at
8
oclock
a
jailer
and
soon
after
him
a
woman
warder
with
curly
grey
hair
dressed
in
a
jacket
with
sleeves
trimmed
with
gold
with
a
blueedged
belt
round
her
waist
and
having
a
look
of
suffering
on
her
face
came
into
the
corridor
you
want
maslova
she
asked
coming
up
to
the
cell
with
the
jailer
who
was
on
duty
the
jailer
rattling
the
iron
padlock
opened
the
door
of
the
cell
from
which
there
came
a
whiff
of
air
fouler
even
than
that
in
the
corridor
and
called
out
maslova
to
the
court
and
closed
the
door
again
even
into
the
prison
yard
the
breeze
had
brought
the
fresh
vivifying
air
from
the
fields
but
in
the
corridor
the
air
was
laden
with
the
germs
of
typhoid
the
smell
of
sewage
putrefaction
and
tar
every
newcomer
felt
sad
and
dejected
in
it
the
woman
warder
felt
this
though
she
was
used
to
bad
air
she
had
just
come
in
from
outside
and
entering
the
corridor
she
at
once
became
sleepy
from
inside
the
cell
came
the
sound
of
bustle
and
womens
voices
and
the
patter
of
bare
feet
on
the
floor
now
then
hurry
up
maslova
i
say
called
out
the
jailer
and
in
a
minute
or
two
a
small
young
woman
with
a
very
full
bust
came
briskly
out
of
the
door
and
went
up
to
the
jailer
she
had
on
a
grey
cloak
over
a
white
jacket
and
petticoat
on
her
feet
she
wore
linen
stockings
and
prison
shoes
and
round
her
head
was
tied
a
white
kerchief
from
under
which
a
few
locks
of
black
hair
were
brushed
over
the
forehead
with
evident
intent
the
face
of
the
woman
was
of
that
whiteness
peculiar
to
people
who
have
lived
long
in
confinement
and
which
puts
one
in
mind
of
shoots
of
potatoes
that
spring
up
in
a
cellar
her
small
broad
hands
and
full
neck
which
showed
from
under
the
broad
collar
of
her
cloak
were
of
the
same
hue
her
black
sparkling
eyes
one
with
a
slight
squint
appeared
in
striking
contrast
to
the
dull
pallor
of
her
face
she
carried
herself
very
straight
expanding
her
full
bosom
with
her
head
slightly
thrown
back
she
stood
in
the
corridor
looking
straight
into
the
eyes
of
the
jailer
ready
to
comply
with
any
order
the
jailer
was
about
to
lock
the
door
when
a
wrinkled
and
severelooking
old
woman
put
out
her
grey
head
and
began
speaking
to
maslova
but
the
jailer
closed
the
door
pushing
the
old
womans
head
with
it
a
womans
laughter
was
heard
from
the
cell
and
maslova
smiled
turning
to
the
little
grated
opening
in
the
cell
door
the
old
woman
pressed
her
face
to
the
grating
from
the
other
side
and
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
now
mind
and
when
they
begin
questioning
you
just
repeat
over
the
same
thing
and
stick
to
it
tell
nothing
that
is
not
wanted
well
it
could
not
be
worse
than
it
is
now
anyhow
i
only
wish
it
was
settled
one
way
or
another
of
course
it
will
be
settled
one
way
or
another
said
the
jailer
with
a
superiors
selfassured
witticism
now
then
get
along
take
your
places
the
old
womans
eyes
vanished
from
the
grating
and
maslova
stepped
out
into
the
middle
of
the
corridor
the
warder
in
front
they
descended
the
stone
stairs
past
the
still
fouler
noisy
cells
of
the
mens
ward
where
they
were
followed
by
eyes
looking
out
of
every
one
of
the
gratings
in
the
doors
and
entered
the
office
where
two
soldiers
were
waiting
to
escort
her
a
clerk
who
was
sitting
there
gave
one
of
the
soldiers
a
paper
reeking
of
tobacco
and
pointing
to
the
prisoner
remarked
take
her
the
soldier
a
peasant
from
nijni
novgorod
with
a
red
pockmarked
face
put
the
paper
into
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
winked
to
his
companion
a
broadshouldered
tchouvash
and
then
the
prisoner
and
the
soldiers
went
to
the
front
entrance
out
of
the
prison
yard
and
through
the
town
up
the
middle
of
the
roughlypaved
street
isvostchiks
cabmen
tradespeople
cooks
workmen
and
government
clerks
stopped
and
looked
curiously
at
the
prisoner
some
shook
their
heads
and
thought
this
is
what
evil
conduct
conduct
unlike
ours
leads
to
the
children
stopped
and
gazed
at
the
robber
with
frightened
looks
but
the
thought
that
the
soldiers
were
preventing
her
from
doing
more
harm
quieted
their
fears
a
peasant
who
had
sold
his
charcoal
and
had
had
some
tea
in
the
town
came
up
and
after
crossing
himself
gave
her
a
copeck
the
prisoner
blushed
and
muttered
something
she
noticed
that
she
was
attracting
everybodys
attention
and
that
pleased
her
the
comparatively
fresh
air
also
gladdened
her
but
it
was
painful
to
step
on
the
rough
stones
with
the
illmade
prison
shoes
on
her
feet
which
had
become
unused
to
walking
passing
by
a
corndealers
shop
in
front
of
which
a
few
pigeons
were
strutting
about
unmolested
by
any
one
the
prisoner
almost
touched
a
greyblue
bird
with
her
foot
it
fluttered
up
and
flew
close
to
her
ear
fanning
her
with
its
wings
she
smiled
then
sighed
deeply
as
she
remembered
her
present
position
chapter
ii
maslovas
early
life
the
story
of
the
prisoner
maslovas
life
was
a
very
common
one
maslovas
mother
was
the
unmarried
daughter
of
a
village
woman
employed
on
a
dairy
farm
which
belonged
to
two
maiden
ladies
who
were
landowners
this
unmarried
woman
had
a
baby
every
year
and
as
often
happens
among
the
village
people
each
one
of
these
undesired
babies
after
it
had
been
carefully
baptised
was
neglected
by
its
mother
whom
it
hindered
at
her
work
and
left
to
starve
five
children
had
died
in
this
way
they
had
all
been
baptised
and
then
not
sufficiently
fed
and
just
left
to
die
the
sixth
baby
whose
father
was
a
gipsy
tramp
would
have
shared
the
same
fate
had
it
not
so
happened
that
one
of
the
maiden
ladies
came
into
the
farmyard
to
scold
the
dairymaids
for
sending
up
cream
that
smelt
of
the
cow
the
young
woman
was
lying
in
the
cowshed
with
a
fine
healthy
newborn
baby
the
old
maiden
lady
scolded
the
maids
again
for
allowing
the
woman
who
had
just
been
confined
to
lie
in
the
cowshed
and
was
about
to
go
away
but
seeing
the
baby
her
heart
was
touched
and
she
offered
to
stand
godmother
to
the
little
girl
and
pity
for
her
little
goddaughter
induced
her
to
give
milk
and
a
little
money
to
the
mother
so
that
she
should
feed
the
baby
and
the
little
girl
lived
the
old
ladies
spoke
of
her
as
the
saved
one
when
the
child
was
three
years
old
her
mother
fell
ill
and
died
and
the
maiden
ladies
took
the
child
from
her
old
grandmother
to
whom
she
was
nothing
but
a
burden
the
little
blackeyed
maiden
grew
to
be
extremely
pretty
and
so
full
of
spirits
that
the
ladies
found
her
very
entertaining
the
younger
of
the
ladies
sophia
ivanovna
who
had
stood
godmother
to
the
girl
had
the
kinder
heart
of
the
two
sisters
maria
ivanovna
the
elder
was
rather
hard
sophia
ivanovna
dressed
the
little
girl
in
nice
clothes
and
taught
her
to
read
and
write
meaning
to
educate
her
like
a
lady
maria
ivanovna
thought
the
child
should
be
brought
up
to
work
and
trained
her
to
be
a
good
servant
she
was
exacting
she
punished
and
when
in
a
bad
temper
even
struck
the
little
girl
growing
up
under
these
two
different
influences
the
girl
turned
out
half
servant
half
young
lady
they
called
her
katusha
which
sounds
less
refined
than
katinka
but
is
not
quite
so
common
as
katka
she
used
to
sew
tidy
up
the
rooms
polish
the
metal
cases
of
the
icons
and
do
other
light
work
and
sometimes
she
sat
and
read
to
the
ladies
though
she
had
more
than
one
offer
she
would
not
marry
she
felt
that
life
as
the
wife
of
any
of
the
working
men
who
were
courting
her
would
be
too
hard
spoilt
as
she
was
by
a
life
of
case
she
lived
in
this
manner
till
she
was
sixteen
when
the
nephew
of
the
old
ladies
a
rich
young
prince
and
a
university
student
came
to
stay
with
his
aunts
and
katusha
not
daring
to
acknowledge
it
even
to
herself
fell
in
love
with
him
then
two
years
later
this
same
nephew
stayed
four
days
with
his
aunts
before
proceeding
to
join
his
regiment
and
the
night
before
he
left
he
betrayed
katusha
and
after
giving
her
a
100rouble
note
went
away
five
months
later
she
knew
for
certain
that
she
was
to
be
a
mother
after
that
everything
seemed
repugnant
to
her
her
only
thought
being
how
to
escape
from
the
shame
that
awaited
her
she
began
not
only
to
serve
the
ladies
in
a
halfhearted
and
negligent
way
but
once
without
knowing
how
it
happened
was
very
rude
to
them
and
gave
them
notice
a
thing
she
repented
of
later
and
the
ladies
let
her
go
noticing
something
wrong
and
very
dissatisfied
with
her
then
she
got
a
housemaids
place
in
a
policeofficers
house
but
stayed
there
only
three
months
for
the
police
officer
a
man
of
fifty
began
to
torment
her
and
once
when
he
was
in
a
specially
enterprising
mood
she
fired
up
called
him
a
fool
and
old
devil
and
gave
him
such
a
knock
in
the
chest
that
he
fell
she
was
turned
out
for
her
rudeness
it
was
useless
to
look
for
another
situation
for
the
time
of
her
confinement
was
drawing
near
so
she
went
to
the
house
of
a
village
midwife
who
also
sold
wine
the
confinement
was
easy
but
the
midwife
who
had
a
case
of
fever
in
the
village
infected
katusha
and
her
baby
boy
had
to
be
sent
to
the
foundlings
hospital
where
according
to
the
words
of
the
old
woman
who
took
him
there
he
at
once
died
when
katusha
went
to
the
midwife
she
had
127
roubles
in
all
27
which
she
had
earned
and
100
given
her
by
her
betrayer
when
she
left
she
had
but
six
roubles
she
did
not
know
how
to
keep
money
but
spent
it
on
herself
and
gave
to
all
who
asked
the
midwife
took
40
roubles
for
two
months
board
and
attendance
25
went
to
get
the
baby
into
the
foundlings
hospital
and
40
the
midwife
borrowed
to
buy
a
cow
with
twenty
roubles
went
just
for
clothes
and
dainties
having
nothing
left
to
live
on
katusha
had
to
look
out
for
a
place
again
and
found
one
in
the
house
of
a
forester
the
forester
was
a
married
man
but
he
too
began
to
annoy
her
from
the
first
day
he
disgusted
her
and
she
tried
to
avoid
him
but
he
more
experienced
and
cunning
besides
being
her
master
who
could
send
her
wherever
he
liked
managed
to
accomplish
his
object
his
wife
found
it
out
and
catching
katusha
and
her
husband
in
a
room
all
by
themselves
began
beating
her
katusha
defended
herself
and
they
had
a
fight
and
katusha
got
turned
out
of
the
house
without
being
paid
her
wages
then
katusha
went
to
live
with
her
aunt
in
town
the
aunts
husband
a
bookbinder
had
once
been
comfortably
off
but
had
lost
all
his
customers
and
had
taken
to
drink
and
spent
all
he
could
lay
hands
on
at
the
publichouse
the
aunt
kept
a
little
laundry
and
managed
to
support
herself
her
children
and
her
wretched
husband
she
offered
katusha
the
place
of
an
assistant
laundress
but
seeing
what
a
life
of
misery
and
hardship
her
aunts
assistants
led
katusha
hesitated
and
applied
to
a
registry
office
for
a
place
one
was
found
for
her
with
a
lady
who
lived
with
her
two
sons
pupils
at
a
public
day
school
a
week
after
katusha
had
entered
the
house
the
elder
a
big
fellow
with
moustaches
threw
up
his
studies
and
made
love
to
her
continually
following
her
about
his
mother
laid
all
the
blame
on
katusha
and
gave
her
notice
it
so
happened
that
after
many
fruitless
attempts
to
find
a
situation
katusha
again
went
to
the
registry
office
and
there
met
a
woman
with
bracelets
on
her
bare
plump
arms
and
rings
on
most
of
her
fingers
hearing
that
katusha
was
badly
in
want
of
a
place
the
woman
gave
her
her
address
and
invited
her
to
come
to
her
house
katusha
went
the
woman
received
her
very
kindly
set
cake
and
sweet
wine
before
her
then
wrote
a
note
and
gave
it
to
a
servant
to
take
to
somebody
in
the
evening
a
tall
man
with
long
grey
hair
and
a
white
beard
entered
the
room
and
sat
down
at
once
near
katusha
smiling
and
gazing
at
her
with
glistening
eyes
he
began
joking
with
her
the
hostess
called
him
away
into
the
next
room
and
katusha
heard
her
say
a
fresh
one
from
the
country
then
the
hostess
called
katusha
aside
and
told
her
that
the
man
was
an
author
and
that
he
had
a
great
deal
of
money
and
that
if
he
liked
her
he
would
not
grudge
her
anything
he
did
like
her
and
gave
her
25
roubles
promising
to
see
her
often
the
25
roubles
soon
went
some
she
paid
to
her
aunt
for
board
and
lodging
the
rest
was
spent
on
a
hat
ribbons
and
such
like
a
few
days
later
the
author
sent
for
her
and
she
went
he
gave
her
another
25
roubles
and
offered
her
a
separate
lodging
next
door
to
the
lodging
rented
for
her
by
the
author
there
lived
a
jolly
young
shopman
with
whom
katusha
soon
fell
in
love
she
told
the
author
and
moved
to
a
little
lodging
of
her
own
the
shopman
who
promised
to
marry
her
went
to
nijni
on
business
without
mentioning
it
to
her
having
evidently
thrown
her
up
and
katusha
remained
alone
she
meant
to
continue
living
in
the
lodging
by
herself
but
was
informed
by
the
police
that
in
this
case
she
would
have
to
get
a
license
she
returned
to
her
aunt
seeing
her
fine
dress
her
hat
and
mantle
her
aunt
no
longer
offered
her
laundry
work
as
she
understood
things
her
niece
had
risen
above
that
sort
of
thing
the
question
as
to
whether
she
was
to
become
a
laundress
or
not
did
not
occur
to
katusha
either
she
looked
with
pity
at
the
thin
hardworked
laundresses
some
already
in
consumption
who
stood
washing
or
ironing
with
their
thin
arms
in
the
fearfully
hot
front
room
which
was
always
full
of
soapy
steam
and
draughts
from
the
windows
and
thought
with
horror
that
she
might
have
shared
the
same
fate
katusha
had
begun
to
smoke
some
time
before
and
since
the
young
shopman
had
thrown
her
up
she
was
getting
more
and
more
into
the
habit
of
drinking
it
was
not
so
much
the
flavour
of
wine
that
tempted
her
as
the
fact
that
it
gave
her
a
chance
of
forgetting
the
misery
she
suffered
making
her
feel
more
unrestrained
and
more
confident
of
her
own
worth
which
she
was
not
when
quite
sober
without
wine
she
felt
sad
and
ashamed
just
at
this
time
a
woman
came
along
who
offered
to
place
her
in
one
of
the
largest
establishments
in
the
city
explaining
all
the
advantages
and
benefits
of
the
situation
katusha
had
the
choice
before
her
of
either
going
into
service
or
accepting
this
offerand
she
chose
the
latter
besides
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
in
this
way
she
could
revenge
herself
on
her
betrayer
and
the
shopman
and
all
those
who
had
injured
her
one
of
the
things
that
tempted
her
and
was
the
cause
of
her
decision

the
woman
telling
her
she
might
order
her
own

a
bright
yellow

trimmed
with
black
velvet
with
low
neck
and
short
sleeves
conquered
her
and
she
gave
up
her
passport
on
the
same
evening
the
procuress
took
an
isvostchik
and
drove
her
to
the
notorious
house
kept
by

from
that
day
a
life
of

commenced
for
katusha

wearied
out
by
the
long

by
two
soldiers

still

on
his
high
bedstead
with
a

on
the
top
of
the
spring
mattress
in
a
fine
clean
wellironed
linen
night

smoking
a
cigarette
and
considering
what
he
had
to
do
today
and
what
had
happened
yesterday
recalling
the
evening
he
had
spent
with
the
korchagins
a
wealthy
and
aristocratic
family
whose
daughter
every
one
expected
he
would
marry
he
sighed
and
throwing
away
the
end
of
his
cigarette
was
going
to
take
another
out
of
the
silver
case
but
changing
his
mind
he
resolutely
raised
his
solid
frame
and
putting
down
his
smooth
white
legs
stepped
into
his
slippers
threw
his
silk
dressing
gown
over
his
broad
shoulders
and
passed
into
his
dressingroom
walking
heavily
and
quickly
there
he
carefully
cleaned
his
teeth
many
of
which
were
filled
with
tooth
powder
and
rinsed
his
mouth
with
scented
elixir
after
that
he
washed
his
hands
with
perfumed
soap
cleaned
his
long
nails
with
particular
care
then
from
a
tap
fixed
to
his
marble
washstand
he
let
a
spray
of
cold
water
run
over
his
face
and
stout
neck
having
finished
this
part
of
the
business
he
went
into
a
third
room
where
a
shower
bath
stood
ready
for
him
having
refreshed
his
full
white
muscular
body
and
dried
it
with
a
rough
bath
sheet
he
put
on
his
fine
undergarments
and
his
boots
and
sat
down
before
the
glass
to
brush
his
black
beard
and
his
curly
hair
that
had
begun
to
get
thin

dressed
leisurely
and
went
into
the
diningroom
a
table
which
looked
very
imposing
with
its
four
legs
carved
in
the
shape
of
lions

and
a

the
day

on

covered
with

petrovna
handing
him
the
letter
with
a
significant
smile
all
right
directly
said
nekhludoff
taking
the
letter
and
frowning
as
he
noticed
agraphena
petrovnas
smile
that
smile
meant
that
the
letter
was
from
the
younger
princess
korchagin
whom
agraphena
petrovna
expected
him
to
marry
this
supposition
of
hers
annoyed
nekhludoff
then
ill
tell
her
to
wait
and
agraphena
petrovna
took
a
crumb
brush
which
was
not
in
its
place
put
it
away
and
sailed
out
of
the
room
nekhludoff
opened
the
perfumed
note
and
began
reading
it
the
note
was
written
on
a
sheet
of
thick
grey
paper
with
rough
edges
the
writing
looked
english
it
said
having
assumed
the
task
of
acting
as
your
memory
i
take
the
liberty
of
reminding
you
that
on
this
the
28th
day
of
april
you
have
to
appear
at
the
law
courts
as
juryman
and
in
consequence
can
on
no
account
accompany

kolosoff
to

with
your
habitual

it

night
after
you
were
gone
so
do
not
forget
princess
m
korchagin
on
the
other
side
was
a
postscript
maman

k
nekhludoff
made
a
grimace
this
note
was
a
continuation
of
that
skilful
manoeuvring
which
the
princess
korchagin
had
already
practised
for
two
months
in
order
to
bind
him
closer
and
closer
with
invisible
threads
and
yet
beside
the
usual
hesitation
of
men
past
their
youth
to
marry
unless
they
are
very
much
in
love
nekhludoff
had
very
good
reasons
why
even
if
he
did
make
up
his
mind
to
it
he
could
not
propose
at
once
it
was
not
that
ten
years
previously
he
had
betrayed
and
forsaken
maslova
he
had
quite
forgotten
that
and
he
would
not
have
considered
it
a
reason
for
not
marrying
no
the
reason
was
that
he
had
a
liaison
with
a
married
woman
and
though
he
considered
it
broken
off
she
did
not
nekhludoff
was
rather
shy
with
women
and
his
very
shyness
awakened
in
this
married
woman
the
unprincipled
wife
of
the
marechal
de
noblesse
of
a
district
where
nekhludoff
was
present
at
an
election
the
desire
of
vanquishing
him
this
woman
drew
him
into
an
intimacy
which
entangled
him
more
and
more
while
it
daily
became
more
distasteful
to
him
having
succumbed
to
the
temptation
nekhludoff
felt
guilty
and
had
not
the
courage
to
break
the
tie
without
her
consent
and
this
was
the
reason
he
did
not
feel
at
liberty
to
propose
to
korchagin
even
if
he
had
wished
to
do
so
among
the
letters
on
the
table
was
one
from
this
womans
husband
seeing
his
writing
and
the
postmark
nekhludoff
flushed
and
felt
his
energies
awakening
as
they
always
did
when
he
was
facing
any
kind
of
danger
but
his
excitement
passed
at
once
the
marechal
do
noblesse
of
the
district
in
which
his
largest
estate
lay
wrote
only
to
let
nekhludoff
know
that
there
was
to
be
a
special
meeting
towards
the
end
of
may
and
that
nekhludoff
was
to
be
sure
and
come
to
donner
un
coup
depaule
at
the
important
debates
concerning
the
schools
and
the
roads
as
a
strong
opposition
by
the
reactionary
party
was
expected
the
marechal
was
a
liberal
and
was
quite
engrossed
in
this
fight
not
even
noticing
the
misfortune
that
had
befallen
him
nekhludoff
remembered
the
dreadful
moments
he
had
lived
through
once
when
he
thought
that
the
husband
had
found
him
out
and
was
going
to
challenge
him
and
he
was
making
up
his
mind
to
fire
into
the
air
also
the
terrible
scene
he
had
with
her
when
she
ran
out
into
the
park
and
in
her
excitement
tried
to
drown
herself
in
the
pond
well
i
cannot
go
now
and
can
do
nothing
until
i
get
a
reply
from
her
thought
nekhludoff
a
week
ago
he
had
written
her
a
decisive
letter
in
which
he
acknowledged
his
guilt
and
his
readiness
to
atone
for
it
but
at
the
same
time
he
pronounced
their
relations
to
be
at
an
end
for
her
own
good
as
he
expressed
it
to
this
letter
he
had
as
yet
received
no
answer
this
might
prove
a
good
sign
for
if
she
did
not
agree
to
break
off
their
relations
she
would
have
written
at
once
or
even
come
herself
as
she
had
done
before
nekhludoff
had
heard
that
there
was
some
officer
who
was
paying
her
marked
attention
and
this
tormented
him
by
awakening
jealousy
and
at
the
same
time
encouraged
him
with
the
hope
of
escape
from
the
deception
that
was
oppressing
him
the
other
letter
was
from
his
steward
the
steward
wrote
to
tell
him
that
a
visit
to
his
estates
was
necessary
in
order
to
enter
into
possession
and
also
to
decide
about
the
further
management
of
his
lands
whether
it
was
to
continue
in
the
same
way
as
when
his
mother
was
alive
or
whether
as
he
had
represented
to
the
late
lamented
princess
and
now
advised
the
young
prince
they
had
not
better
increase
their
stock
and
farm
all
the
land
now
rented
by
the
peasants
themselves
the
steward
wrote
that
this
would
be
a
far
more
profitable
way
of
managing
the
property
at
the
same
time
he
apologised
for
not
having
forwarded
the
3000
roubles
income
due
on
the
1st
this
money
would
be
sent
on
by
the
next
mail
the
reason
for
the
delay
was
that
he
could
not
get
the
money
out
of
the
peasants
who
had
grown
so
untrustworthy
that
he
had
to
appeal
to
the
authorities
this
letter
was
partly
disagreeable
and
partly
pleasant
it
was
pleasant
to
feel
that
he
had
power
over
so
large
a
property
and
yet
disagreeable
because
nekhludoff
had
been
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
henry
george
and
herbert
spencer
being
himself
heir
to
a
large
property
he
was
especially
struck
by
the
position
taken
up
by
spencer
in
social
statics
that
justice
forbids
private
landholding
and
with
the
straightforward
resoluteness
of
his
age
had
not
merely
spoken
to
prove
that
land
could
not
be
looked
upon
as
private
property
and
written
essays
on
that
subject
at
the
university
but
had
acted
up
to
his
convictions
and
considering
it
wrong
to
hold
landed
property
had
given
the
small
piece
of
land
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
to
the
peasants
inheriting
his
mothers
large
estates
and
thus
becoming
a
landed
proprietor
he
had
to
choose
one
of
two
things
either
to
give
up
his
property
as
he
had
given
up
his
fathers
land
ten
years
before
or
silently
to
confess
that
all
his
former
ideas
were
mistaken
and
false
he
could
not
choose
the
former
because
he
had
no
means
but
the
landed
estates
he
did
not
care
to
serve
moreover
he
had
formed
luxurious
habits
which
he
could
not
easily
give
up
besides
he
had
no
longer
the
same
inducements
his
strong
convictions
the
resoluteness
of
youth
and
the
ambitious
desire
to
do
something
unusual
were
gone
as
to
the
second
course
that
of
denying
those
clear
and
unanswerable
proofs
of
the
injustice
of
landholding
which
he
had
drawn
from
spencers
social
statics
and
the
brilliant
corroboration
of
which
he
had
at
a
later
period
found
in
the
works
of
henry
george
such
a
course
was
impossible
to
him
chapter
iv
missy
when
nekhludoff
had
finished
his
coffee
he
went
to
his
study
to
look
at
the
summons
and
find
out
what
time
he
was
to
appear
at
the
court
before
writing
his
answer
to
the
princess
passing
through
his
studio
where
a
few
studies
hung
on
the
walls
and
facing
the
easel
stood
an
unfinished
picture
a
feeling
of
inability
to
advance
in
art
a
sense
of
his
incapacity
came
over
him
he
had
often
had
this
feeling
of
late
and
explained
it
by
his
too
finelydeveloped
aesthetic
taste
still
the
feeling
was
a
very
unpleasant
one
seven
years
before
this
he
had
given
up
military
service
feeling
sure
that
he
had
a
talent
for
art
and
had
looked
down
with
some
disdain
at
all
other
activity
from
the
height
of
his
artistic
standpoint
and
now
it
turned
out
that
he
had
no
right
to
do
so
and
therefore
everything
that
reminded
him
of
all
this
was
unpleasant
he
looked
at
the
luxurious
fittings
of
the
studio
with
a
heavy
heart
and
it
was
in
no
cheerful
mood
that
he
entered
his
study
a
large
lofty
room
fitted
up
with
a
view
to
comfort
convenience
and
elegant
appearance
he
found
the
summons
at
once
in
a
pigeon
hole
labelled
immediate
of
his
large
writing
table
he
had
to
appear
at
the
court
at
11
oclock
nekhludoff
sat
down
to
write
a
note
in
reply
to
the
princess
thanking
her
for
the
invitation
and
promising
to
try
and
come
to
dinner
having
written
one
note
he
tore
it
up
as
it
seemed
too
intimate
he
wrote
another
but
it
was
too
cold
he
feared
it
might
give
offence
so
he
tore
it
up
too
he
pressed
the
button
of
an
electric
bell
and
his
servant
an
elderly
moroselooking
man
with
whiskers
and
shaved
chin
and
lip
wearing
a
grey
cotton
apron
entered
at
the
door
send
to
fetch
an
isvostchik
please
yes
sir
and
tell
the
person
who
is
waiting
that
i
send
thanks
for
the
invitation
and
shall
try
to
come
yes
sir
it
is
not
very
polite
but
i
cant
write
no
matter
i
shall
see
her
today
thought
nekhludoff
and
went
to
get
his
overcoat
when
he
came
out
of
the
house
an
isvostchik
he
knew
with
indiarubber
tires
to
his
trap
was
at
the
door
waiting
for
him
you
had
hardly
gone
away
from
prince
korchagins
yesterday
he
said
turning
half
round
when
i
drove
up
and
the
swiss
at
the
door
says
just
gone
the
isvostchik
knew
that
nekhludoff
visited
at
the
korchagins
and
called
there
on
the
chance
of
being
engaged
by
him
even
the
isvostchiks
know
of
my
relations
with
the
korchagins
thought
nekhludoff
and
again
the
question
whether
he
should
not
marry
princess
korchagin
presented
itself
to
him
and
he
could
not
decide
it
either
way
any
more
than
most
of
the
questions
that
arose
in
his
mind
at
this
time
it
was
in
favour
of
marriage
in
general
that
besides
the
comforts
of
hearth
and
home
it
made
a
moral
life
possible
and
chiefly
that
a
family
would
so
nekhludoff
thought
give
an
aim
to
his
now
empty
life
against
marriage
in
general
was
the
fear
common
to
bachelors
past
their
first
youth
of
losing
freedom
and
an
unconscious
awe
before
this
mysterious
creature
a
woman
in
this
particular
case
in
favour
of
marrying
missy
her
name
was
mary
but
as
is
usual
among
a
certain
set
a
nickname
had
been
given
her
was
that
she
came
of
good
family
and
differed
in
everything
manner
of
speaking
walking
laughing
from
the
common
people
not
by
anything
exceptional
but
by
her
good
breedinghe
could
find
no
other
term
for
this
quality
though
he
prized
it
very
highlyand
besides
she
thought
more
of
him
than
of
anybody
else
therefore
evidently
understood
him
this
understanding
of
him
ie
the
recognition
of
his
superior
merits
was
to
nekhludoff
a
proof
of
her
good
sense
and
correct
judgment
against
marrying
missy
in
particular
was
that
in
all
likelihood
a
girl
with
even
higher
qualities
could
be
found
that
she
was
already
27
and
that
he
was
hardly
her
first
love
this
last
idea
was
painful
to
him
his
pride
would
not
reconcile
itself
with
the
thought
that
she
had
loved
some
one
else
even
in
the
past
of
course
she
could
not
have
known
that
she
should
meet
him
but
the
thought
that
she
was
capable
of
loving
another
offended
him
so
that
he
had
as
many
reasons
for
marrying
as
against
it
at
any
rate
they
weighed
equally
with
nekhludoff
who
laughed
at
himself
and
called
himself
the
ass
of
the
fable
remaining
like
that
animal
undecided
which
haycock
to
turn
to
at
any
rate
before
i
get
an
answer
from
mary
vasilievna
the
marechals
wife
and
finish
completely
with
her
i
can
do
nothing
he
said
to
himself
and
the
conviction
that
he
might
and
was
even
obliged
to
delay
his
decision
was
comforting
well
i
shall
consider
all
that
later
on
he
said
to
himself
as
the
trap
drove
silently
along
the
asphalt
pavement
up
to
the
doors
of
the
court
now
i
must
fulfil
my
public
duties
conscientiously
as
i
am
in
the
habit
of
always
doing
and
as
i
consider
it
right
to
do
besides
they
are
often
interesting
and
he
entered
the
hall
of
the
law
courts
past
the
doorkeeper
chapter
v
the
jurymen
the
corridors
of
the
court
were
already
full
of
activity
the
attendants
hurried
out
of
breath
dragging
their
feet
along
the
ground
without
lifting
them
backwards
and
forwards
with
all
sorts
of
messages
and
papers
ushers
advocates
and
law
officers
passed
hither
and
thither
plaintiffs
and
those
of
the
accused
who
were
not
guarded
wandered
sadly
along
the
walls
or
sat
waiting
where
is
the
law
court
nekhludoff
asked
of
an
attendant
which
there
is
the
civil
court
and
the
criminal
court
i
am
on
the
jury
the
criminal
court
you
should
have
said
here
to
the
right
then
to
the
leftthe
second
door
nekhludoff
followed
the
direction
meanwhile
some
of
the
criminal
court
jurymen
who
were
late
had
hurriedly
passed
into
a
separate
room
at
the
door
mentioned
two
men
stood
waiting
one
a
tall
fat
merchant
a
kindhearted
fellow
had
evidently
partaken
of
some
refreshments
and
a
glass
of
something
and
was
in
most
pleasant
spirits
the
other
was
a
shopman
of
jewish
extraction
they
were
talking
about
the
price
of
wool
when
nekhludoff
came
up
and
asked
them
if
this
was
the
jurymens
room
yes
my
dear
sir
this
is
it
one
of
us
on
the
jury
are
you
asked
the
merchant
with
a
merry
wink
ah
well
we
shall
have
a
go
at
the
work
together
he
continued
after
nekhludoff
had
answered
in
the
affirmative
my
name
is
baklasheff
merchant
of
the
second
guild
he
said
putting
out
his
broad
soft
flexible
hand
with
whom
have
i
the
honour
nekhludoff
gave
his
name
and
passed
into
the
jurymens
room
inside
the
room
were
about
ten
persons
of
all
sorts
they
had
come
but
a
short
while
ago
and
some
were
sitting
others
walking
up
and
down
looking
at
each
other
and
making
each
others
acquaintance
there
was
a
retired
colonel
in
uniform
some
were
in
frock
coats
others
in
morning
coats
and
only
one
wore
a
peasants
dress
their
faces
all
had
a
certain
look
of
satisfaction
at
the
prospect
of
fulfilling
a
public
duty
although
many
of
them
had
had
to
leave
their
businesses
and
most
were
complaining
of
it
the
jurymen
talked
among
themselves
about
the
weather
the
early
spring
and
the
business
before
them
some
having
been
introduced
others
just
guessing
who
was
who
those
who
were
not
acquainted
with
nekhludoff
made
haste
to
get
introduced
evidently
looking
upon
this
as
an
honour
and
he
taking
it
as
his
due
as
he
always
did
when
among
strangers
had
he
been
asked
why
he
considered
himself
above
the
majority
of
people
he
could
not
have
given
an
answer
the
life
he
had
been
living
of
late
was
not
particularly
meritorious
the
fact
of
his
speaking
english
french
and
german
with
a
good
accent
and
of
his
wearing
the
best
linen
clothes
ties
and
studs
bought
from
the
most
expensive
dealers
in
these
goods
he
quite
knew
would
not
serve
as
a
reason
for
claiming
superiority
at
the
same
time
he
did
claim
superiority
and
accepted
the
respect
paid
him
as
his
due
and
was
hurt
if
he
did
not
get
it
in
the
jurymens
room
his
feelings
were
hurt
by
disrespectful
treatment
among
the
jury
there
happened
to
be
a
man
whom
he
knew
a
former
teacher
of
his
sisters
children
peter
gerasimovitch
nekhludoff
never
knew
his
surname
and
even
bragged
a
bit
about
this
this
man
was
now
a
master
at
a
public
school
nekhludoff
could
not
stand
his
familiarity
his
selfsatisfied
laughter
his
vulgarity
in
short
ah
ha
youre
also
trapped
these
were
the
words
accompanied
with
boisterous
laughter
with
which
peter
gerasimovitch
greeted
nekhludoff
have
you
not
managed
to
get
out
of
it
i
never
meant
to
get
out
of
it
replied
nekhludoff
gloomily
and
in
a
tone
of
severity
well
i
call
this
being
public
spirited
but
just
wait
until
you
get
hungry
or
sleepy
youll
sing
to
another
tune
then
this
son
of
a
priest
will
be
saying
thou
in
russian
as
in
many
other
languages
thou
is
used
generally
among
people
very
familiar
with
each
other
or
by
superiors
to
inferiors
to
me
next
thought
nekhludoff
and
walked
away
with
such
a
look
of
sadness
on
his
face
as
might
have
been
natural
if
he
had
just
heard
of
the
death
of
all
his
relations
he
came
up
to
a
group
that
had
formed
itself
round
a
cleanshaven
tall
dignified
man
who
was
recounting
something
with
great
animation
this
man
was
talking
about
the
trial
going
on
in
the
civil
court
as
of
a
case
well
known
to
himself
mentioning
the
judges
and
a
celebrated
advocate
by
name
he
was
saying
that
it
seemed
wonderful
how
the
celebrated
advocate
had
managed
to
give
such
a
clever
turn
to
the
affair
that
an
old
lady
though
she
had
the
right
on
her
side
would
have
to
pay
a
large
sum
to
her
opponent
the
advocate
is
a
genius
he
said
the
listeners
heard
it
all
with
respectful
attention
and
several
of
them
tried
to
put
in
a
word
but
the
man
interrupted
them
as
if
he
alone
knew
all
about
it
though
nekhludoff
had
arrived
late
he
had
to
wait
a
long
time
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
had
not
yet
come
and
everybody
was
kept
waiting
chapter
vi
the
judges
the
president
who
had
to
take
the
chair
had
arrived
early
the
president
was
a
tall
stout
man
with
long
grey
whiskers
though
married
he
led
a
very
loose
life
and
his
wife
did
the
same
so
they
did
not
stand
in
each
others
way
this
morning
he
had
received
a
note
from
a
swiss
girl
who
had
formerly
been
a
governess
in
his
house
and
who
was
now
on
her
way
from
south
russia
to
st
petersburg
she
wrote
that
she
would
wait
for
him
between
five
and
six
pm
in
the
hotel
italia
this
made
him
wish
to
begin
and
get
through
the
sitting
as
soon
as
possible
so
as
to
have
time
to
call
before
six
pm
on
the
little
redhaired
clara
vasilievna
with
whom
he
had
begun
a
romance
in
the
country
last
summer
he
went
into
a
private
room
latched
the
door
took
a
pair
of
dumbbells
out
of
a
cupboard
moved
his
arms
20
times
upwards
downwards
forwards
and
sideways
then
holding
the
dumbbells
above
his
head
lightly
bent
his
knees
three
times
nothing
keeps
one
going
like
a
cold
bath
and
exercise
he
said
feeling
the
biceps
of
his
right
arm
with
his
left
hand
on
the
third
finger
of
which
he
wore
a
gold
ring
he
had
still
to
do
the
moulinee
movement
for
he
always
went
through
those
two
exercises
before
a
long
sitting
when
there
was
a
pull
at
the
door
the
president
quickly
put
away
the
dumbbells
and
opened
the
door
saying
i
beg
your
pardon
one
of
the
members
a
highshouldered
discontentedlooking
man
with
gold
spectacles
came
into
the
room
matthew
nikitich
has
again
not
come
he
said
in
a
dissatisfied
tone
not
yet
said
the
president
putting
on
his
uniform
he
is
always
late
it
is
extraordinary
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
said
the
member
angrily
and
taking
out
a
cigarette
this
member
a
very
precise
man
had
had
an
unpleasant
encounter
with
his
wife
in
the
morning
because
she
had
spent
her
allowance
before
the
end
of
the
month
and
had
asked
him
to
give
her
some
money
in
advance
but
he
would
not
give
way
to
her
and
they
had
a
quarrel
the
wife
told
him
that
if
he
were
going
to
behave
so
he
need
not
expect
any
dinner
there
would
be
no
dinner
for
him
at
home
at
this
point
he
left
fearing
that
she
might
carry
out
her
threat
for
anything
might
be
expected
from
her
this
comes
of
living
a
good
moral
life
he
thought
looking
at
the
beaming
healthy
cheerful
and
kindly
president
who
with
elbows
far
apart
was
smoothing
his
thick
grey
whiskers
with
his
fine
white
hands
over
the
embroidered
collar
of
his
uniform
he
is
always
contented
and
merry
while
i
am
suffering
the
secretary
came
in
and
brought
some
document
thanks
very
much
said
the
president
lighting
a
cigarette
which
case
shall
we
take
first
then
the
poisoning
case
i
should
say
answered
the
secretary
with
indifference
all
right
the
poisoning
case
let
it
be
said
the
president
thinking
that
he
could
get
this
case
over
by
four
oclock
and
then
go
away
and
matthew
nikitich
has
he
come
not
yet
and
breve
he
is
here
replied
the
secretary
then
if
you
see
him
please
tell
him
that
we
begin
with
the
poisoning
case
breve
was
the
public
prosecutor
who
was
to
read
the
indictment
in
this
case
in
the
corridor
the
secretary
met
breve
who
with
up
lifted
shoulders
a
portfolio
under
one
arm
the
other
swinging
with
the
palm
turned
to
the
front
was
hurrying
along
the
corridor
clattering
with
his
heels
michael
petrovitch
wants
to
know
if
you
are
ready
the
secretary
asked
of
course
i
am
always
ready
said
the
public
prosecutor
what
are
we
taking
first
the
poisoning
case
thats
quite
right
said
the
public
prosecutor
but
did
not
think
it
at
all
right
he
had
spent
the
night
in
a
hotel
playing
cards
with
a
friend
who
was
giving
a
farewell
party
up
to
five
in
the
morning
they
played
and
drank
so
he
had
no
time
to
look
at
this
poisoning
case
and
meant
to
run
it
through
now
the
secretary
happening
to
know
this
advised
the
president
to
begin
with
the
poisoning
case
the
secretary
was
a
liberal
even
a
radical
in
opinion
breve
was
a
conservative
the
secretary
disliked
him
and
envied
him
his
position
well
and
how
about
the
skoptzy
a
religious
sect
asked
the
secretary
i
have
already
said
that
i
cannot
do
it
without
witnesses
and
so
i
shall
say
to
the
court
dear
me
what
does
it
matter
i
cannot
do
it
said
breve
and
waving
his
arm
he
ran
into
his
private
room
he
was
putting
off
the
case
of
the
skoptzy
on
account
of
the
absence
of
a
very
unimportant
witness
his
real
reason
being
that
if
they
were
tried
by
an
educated
jury
they
might
possibly
be
acquitted
by
an
agreement
with
the
president
this
case
was
to
be
tried
in
the
coming
session
at
a
provincial
town
where
there
would
be
more
peasants
and
therefore
more
chances
of
conviction
the
movement
in
the
corridor
increased
the
people
crowded
most
at
the
doors
of
the
civil
court
in
which
the
case
that
the
dignified
man
talked
about
was
being
heard
an
interval
in
the
proceeding
occurred
and
the
old
woman
came
out
of
the
court
whose
property
that
genius
of
an
advocate
had
found
means
of
getting
for
his
client
a
person
versed
in
law
who
had
no
right
to
it
whatever
the
judges
knew
all
about
the
case
and
the
advocate
and
his
client
knew
it
better
still
but
the
move
they
had
invented
was
such
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
take
the
old
womans
property
and

was
stout
well
dressed
and
had
enormous
flowers
on
her
bonnet
she
stopped
as
she
came
out
of
the
door
and
spreading
out
her
short
fat
arms
and
turning
to
her
advocate
she
kept
repeating
what
does
it
all
mean
just
fancy
the
advocate
was
looking
at
the
flowers
in
her
bonnet
and
evidently
not
listening
to
her
but
considering
some
question

other

the
old
woman
out

shirt

glistening
from
under
his
lowcut
waistcoat
with
a
selfsatisfied
look
on
his
face
came
the
celebrated
advocate
who
had
managed
to
arrange
matters
so
that
the
old
woman
lost
all
she
had
and
the
person
versed
in
the
law
received
more
than
100000
roubles
the
advocate
passed
close
to
the
old
woman
and
feeling
all
eyes
directed
towards
him
his
whole
bearing

say

deference

could
not

the

to

with
an
amiable
wave
of
his
hand
all
moved
towards
the
door
pausing
to
let
each
other
pass
then
they
went
through
the
corridor
into
the
court
the
court
was
a
large
long
room
at
one
end
there
was
a
raised
platform
with
three
steps
leading
up
to
it
on
which
stood
a
table
covered
with
a
green
cloth
trimmed
with
a
fringe
of
a
darker
shade
at
the
table
were
placed
three
armchairs
with
highcarved
oak
backs
on
the
wall
behind
them
hung
a
fulllength
brightlycoloured
portrait
of
the
emperor
in
uniform
and
ribbon
with
one
foot
in
advance
and
holding
a
sword
in
the
right
corner
hung
a
case
with
an
image
of
christ
crowned
with
thorns
and
beneath
it
stood
a
lectern
and
on
the
same
side
the
prosecuting
attorneys
desk
on
the
left
opposite
the
desk
was
the
secretarys

and
in
front
of
it
nearer
the
public
an
oak
grating
with
the
prisoners
bench
as
yet
unoccupied
behind
it
besides
all
this
there
were
on
the
right
side
of
the
platform
highbacked
ashwood
chairs
for
the

and
on
the
floor
below
tables
for
the
advocates
all
this
was
in
the
front
part
of
the
court
divided
from
the
back
by
a
grating
the
back
was
all
taken
up
by
seats
in
tiers
sitting
on
the
front
seats
were
four
women
either
servant
or
factory
girls
and
two
working
men
evidently
overawed
by
the
grandeur
of
the
room
and
not
venturing
to
speak
above
a
whisper
soon
after
the
jury
had
come
in
the
usher
entered
with
his
sideward
gait
and
stepping
to
the
front
called
out
in
a
loud
voice
as
if
he
meant
to
frighten
those
present
the
court
is
coming
every
one
got
up
as
the
members
stepped
on
to
the
platform
among
them
the
president
with
his
muscles
and
fine
whiskers
next
came
the
gloomy
member
of
the
court
who
was
now
more
gloomy
than
ever
having
met
his
brotherinlaw
who
informed
him
that
he
had
just
called
in
to
see
his
sister
the
members
wife
and
that
she
had
told
him
that
there
would
be
no
dinner
there
so
that
evidently
we
shall
have
to
call
in
at
a
cook
shop
the
brotherinlaw
added
laughing
it
is
not
at
all
funny
said
the
gloomy
member
and
became
gloomier
still
then
at
last
came
the
third
member
of
the
court
the
same
matthew
nikitich
who
was
always
late
he
was
a
bearded
man
with
large
round
kindly
eyes
he
was
suffering
from
a
catarrh
of
the
stomach
and
according
to
his
doctors
advice
he
had
begun
trying
a
new
treatment
and
this
had
kept
him
at
home
longer
than
usual
now
as
he
was
ascending
the
platform
he
had
a
pensive
air
he
was
in
the
habit
of
making
guesses
in
answer
to
all
sorts
of
selfput
questions
by
different
curious
means
just
now
he
had
asked
whether
the
new
treatment
would
be
beneficial
and
had
decided
that
it
would
cure
his
catarrh
if
the
number
of
steps
from
the
door
to
his
chair
would
divide
by
three
he
made
26
steps
but
managed
to
get
in
a
27th
just
by
his
chair
the
figures
of
the
president
and
the
members
in
their
uniforms
with
goldembroidered
collars
looked
very
imposing
they
seemed
to
feel
this
themselves
and
as
if
overpowered
by
their
own
grandeur
hurriedly
sat
down
on
the
high
backed
chairs
behind
the
table
with
the
green
cloth
on
which
were

in
with
the
judges
with
his
portfolio
under
one
arm
and
swinging
the
other
he
hurriedly
walked
to
his
seat
near
the
window
and
was
instantly
absorbed
in
reading
and
looking
through
the
papers
not
wasting
a
single
moment
in
hope
of
being
ready
when
the
business
commenced
he
had
been
public
prosecutor
but
a
short
time
and
had
only
prosecuted
four
times
before
this
he
was
very
ambitious
and
had
firmly
made
up
his
mind
to
get
on
and
therefore
thought
it
necessary
to
get
a
conviction
whenever
he
prosecuted
he
knew
the
chief
facts
of
the
poisoning
case
and
had
already
formed
a
plan
of
action
he
only
wanted
to
copy
out
a
few
points
which
he
required
the
secretary
sat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
platform
and
having
got
ready
all
the
papers
he
might
want
was
looking
through
an
article
prohibited
by
the
censor
which
he
had
procured
and
read
the
day
before
he
was
anxious
to
have
a
talk
about
this
article
with
the
bearded
member
who
shared
his
views
but
wanted
to
look
through
it
once
more
before
doing
so

in
the

the
president
having
looked
through
some
papers
and
put
a
few
questions
to
the
usher
and
the
secretary
gave
the
order
for
the
prisoners
to
be
brought
in
the
door

the
grating
was
instantly
opened
and
two
gendarmes
with
caps
on
their
heads
and
holding
naked
swords
in
their
hands
came
in
followed
by
the
prisoners
a
redhaired
freckled
man
and
two
women
the
man
wore
a
prison
cloak
which
was
too
long
and
too
wide
for
him
he
stuck
out
his
thumbs
and
held
his
arms
close
to
his
sides
thus
keeping
the
sleeves
which
were
also
too
long
from
slipping
over
his
hands
without
looking
at
the
judges
he
gazed
steadfastly
at
the
form
and
passing
to
the
other
side
of
it
he
sat
down
carefully
at
the
very
edge
leaving
plenty
of
room
for
the
others
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
president
and
began
moving
the
muscles
of
his
cheeks
as
if
whispering
something
the
woman
who
came
next
was
also
dressed
in
a
prison
cloak
and
had
a
prison
kerchief
round
her
head
she
had
a
sallow
complexion
no
eyebrows
or
lashes
and
very
red
eyes
this
woman
appeared
perfectly
calm
having
caught
her
cloak
against
something
she
detached
it
carefully
without
any
haste
and
sat
down
the
third
prisoner
was
maslova
as
soon
as
she
appeared
the
eyes
of
all
the
men
in
the
court
turned
her
way
and
remained
fixed
on
her
white
face
her
sparklinglybrilliant
black
eyes
and
the
swelling
bosom
under
the
prison
cloak
even
the
gendarme
whom
she
passed
on
her
way
to
her
seat
looked
at
her
fixedly
till
she
sat
down
and
then
as
if
feeling
guilty
hurriedly
turned
away
shook
himself
and
began
staring
at
the
window
in
front
of
him
the
president
paused
until
the
prisoners
had
taken
their
seats
and
when
maslova
was
seated
turned
to
the
secretary
then
the
usual
procedure
commenced
the
counting
of
the
jury

about
those
who
had
not
come

folded
up
some
bits
of
paper
and
put
them
in

of
the
glass
vases
the
president
turned
up
the
goldembroidered
cuffs
of
his
uniform
a
little
way
and
began
drawing
the
lots
one
by
one
and
opening
them
nekhludoff
was
among
the
jurymen
thus
drawn
then
having
let
down
his
sleeves
the
president
requested
the
priest
to
swear
in
the
jury
the
old
priest
with
his
puffy
red
face
his
brown
gown
and
his
gold
cross
and
little
order
laboriously
moving
his
stiff
legs
came
up
to
the
lectern
beneath
the
icon
the
jurymen
got
up
and
crowded
towards
the
lectern
come
up
please
said
the
priest
pulling
at
the
cross
on
his
breast
with
his
plump
hand
and
waiting
till
all
the
jury
had
drawn
near
when
they
had
all
come
up
the
steps
of
the
platform
the
priest
passed
his
bald
grey
head
sideways
through
the
greasy
opening
of
the
stole
and
having
rearranged
his
thin
hair
he
again
turned
to
the
jury
now
raise
your
right
arms
in
this
way
and
put
your
fingers
together
thus
he
said
with
his
tremulous
old
voice
lifting
his
fat
dimpled
hand
and
putting
the
thumb
and
two
first
fingers
together
as
if
taking
a
pinch
of
something
now
repeat
after
me
i
promise
and
swear
by
the
almighty
god
by
his
holy
gospels
and
by
the
lifegiving
cross
of
our
lord
that
in
this
work
which
he
said
pausing
between
each
sentencedont
let
your
arm
down
hold
it
like
this
he
remarked
to
a
young
man
who
had
lowered
his
armthat
in
this
work
which




the
dignified
man
with
the
whiskers
the
colonel
the
merchant
and
several
more
held
their
arms
and
fingers
as
the
priest
required
of
them
very
high
very
exactly
as
if
they
liked
doing
it
others
did
it
unwillingly
and
carelessly
some
repeated
the
words
too
loudly
and
with
a
defiant
tone
as
if
they
meant
to
say
in
spite
of
all
i
will
and
shall
speak
others
whispered
very
low
and
not
fast
enough
and
then
as
if
frightened
hurried
to
catch
up
the
priest
some
kept
their
fingers
tightly
together
as
if
fearing
to
drop
the
pinch
of
invisible
something
they
held
others
kept
separating
and
folding
theirs
every
one
save
the
old
priest
felt
awkward
but
he
was
sure
he
was
fulfilling
a
very
useful
and
important
duty
after
the
swearing
in
the
president
requested
the
jury
to
choose
a
foreman
and
the
jury
thronging
to
the
door
passed
out
into
the
debatingroom
where
almost
all
of
them
at
once
began
to
smoke
cigarettes
some
one
proposed
the
dignified
man
as
foreman
and
he
was
unanimously
accepted
then
the
jurymen
put
out
their
cigarettes
and
threw
them
away
and
returned
to
the
court
the
dignified
man
informed
the
president
that
he
was
chosen
foreman
and
all
sat
down
again
on
the
highbacked
chairs
everything
went
smoothly
quickly
and
not
without
a
certain
solemnity
and
this
exactitude
order
and
solemnity
evidently
pleased
those
who
took
part
in
it
it
strengthened
the
impression
that
they
were
fulfilling
a
serious
and
valuable
public
duty
nekhludoff
too
felt
this
as
soon
as
the
jurymen
were
seated
the
president
made
a
speech
on
their
rights
obligations
and
responsibilities
while
speaking
he
kept
changing
his
position
now
leaning
on
his
right
now
on
his
left
hand
now
against
the
back
then
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
now
putting
the
papers
straight
now
handling
his
pencil
and
paperknife
according
to
his
words
they
had
the
right
of
interrogating
the
prisoners
through
the
president
to
use
paper
and
pencils
and
to
examine
the
articles
put
in
as
evidence
their
duty
was
to
judge
not
falsely
but
justly
their
responsibility
meant
that
if
the
secrecy
of
their
discussion
were
violated
or
communications
were
established
with
outsiders
they
would
be
liable
to
punishment
every
one
listened
with
an
expression
of
respectful
attention
the
merchant
diffusing
a
smell
of
brandy
around
him
and
restraining
loud
hiccups
approvingly
nodded

up
his

your

he
said
rapidly
with
a
cracked

having
evidently
prepared

kartinkin
sat
down
only
when
the
usher
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
with
preternaturally
wideopen
eyes
ran
up
and
said
in
a
tragic
whisper
sit
down
sit
down
kartinkin
sat
down
as
hurriedly
as
he
had
risen
wrapping
his
cloak
round
him
and
again
began
moving
his
lips
silently
your
name
asked
the
president
with
a
weary
sigh
at
being
obliged
to
repeat
the
same
questions
without
looking
at
the
prisoner
but
glancing
over
a
paper
that
lay
before
him
the
president
was
so
used
to
his
task
that
in
order
to
get
quicker
through
it
all
he
did
two
things
at
a
time
botchkova
was
fortythree
years
old
and
came
from
the
town
of
kalomna
she
too
had
been
in
service
at
the
hotel
mauritania
i
have
never
been
tried
before
and
have
received
a
copy
of
the
indictment
she
gave
her
answers
boldly
in
a
tone
of
voice
as
if
she
meant
to
add
to
each
answer
and
i
dont
care
who
knows
it
and
i
wont
stand
any
nonsense
she
did
not
wait
to
be
told
but
sat
down
as
soon
as
she
had
replied
to
the
last
question
your
name
turning
abruptly
to
the
third
prisoner
you
will
have
to
rise
he
added
softly
and
gently
seeing
that
maslova
kept
her
seat
maslova
got
up
and
stood
with
her
chest
expanded
looking
at
the
president
with
that
peculiar
expression
of
readiness
in
her
smiling
black
eyes
what
is
your
name
lubov
she
said
nekhludoff
had
put
on
his
pincenez
looking
at
the
prisoners
while
they
were
being
questioned
no
it
is
impossible
he
thought
not
taking
his
eyes
off
the
prisoner
lubov
how
can
it
be
he
thought
to
himself
after
hearing
her
answer
the
president
was
going
to
continue
his
questions
but
the
member
with
the
spectacles
interrupted
him
angrily
whispering
something
the
president
nodded
and
turned
again
to
the
prisoner
how
is
this
he
said
you
are
not
put
down
here
as
lubov
the
prisoner
remained
silent
i
want
your
real
name
what
is
your
baptismal
name
asked
the
angry
member
formerly
i
used
to
be
called
katerina
no
it
cannot
be
said
nekhludoff
to
himself
and
yet
he
was
now
certain
that
this
was
she
that
same
girl
half
ward
half
servant
to
his
aunts
that
katusha
with
whom
he
had
once
been
in
love
really
in
love
but
whom
he
had
betrayed
and
then
abandoned
and
never
again
brought
to
mind
for
the
memory
would
have
been
too
painful
would
have
convicted
him
too
clearly
proving
that
he
who
was
so
proud
of
his
integrity
had
treated
this
woman
in
a
revolting
scandalous
way
yes
this
was
she
he
now
clearly
saw
in
her
face
that
strange
indescribable
individuality
which
distinguishes
every
face
from
all
others
something
peculiar
all
its
own
not
to
be
found
anywhere
else
in
spite
of
the
unhealthy
pallor
and
the
fulness
of
the
face
it
was
there
this
sweet
peculiar
individuality
on
those
lips
in
the
slight
squint
of
her
eyes
in
the
voice
particularly
in
the
naive
smile
and
in
the
expression
of
readiness
on
the
face
and
figure
you
should
have
said
so
remarked
the
president
again
in
a
gentle
tone
your
patronymic
i
am
illegitimate
well
were
you
not
called
by
your
godfathers
name
yes
mikhaelovna
and
what
is
it
she
can
be
guilty
of
continued
nekhludoff
in
his
mind
unable
to
breathe
freely
your
family
nameyour
surname
i
mean

used
to

maslova

silent
what
was
your
employment
you
know
yourself
she
said
and
smiled
then
casting
a
hurried
look
round
the
room
again
turned
her
eyes
on
the
president
there
was
something
so
unusual
in
the
expression
of
her
face
so
terrible
and
piteous
in
the
meaning
of
the
words
she
had
uttered
in
this
smile
and
in
the
furtive
glance
she
had
cast
round
the
room
that
the
president
was
abashed
and
for
a
few
minutes
silence
reigned
in
the
court
the
silence
was
broken
by
some
one
among
the
public
laughing
then
somebody
said
ssh
and
the
president
looked
up
and
continued
have
you
ever
been
tried
before
never
answered
maslova
softly
and
sighed
have
you
received
a
copy
of
the
indictment
i
have
she
answered
sit
down
the
prisoner
leant
back
to
pick
up
her
skirt
in
the
way
a
fine
lady
picks
up
her
train
and
sat
down
folding
her
small
white
hands
in
the
sleeves
of
her
cloak
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
president
her
face
was
calm
again
the
witnesses
were
called
and
some
sent
away
the
doctor
who
was
to
act
as
expert
was
chosen
and
called
into
the
court
then
the
secretary
got
up
and
began
reading
the
indictment
he
read
distinctly
though
he
pronounced
the
i
and
r
alike
with
a
loud
voice
but
so
quickly
that
the
words
ran
into
one
another
and
formed
one
uninterrupted
dreary
drone
the
judges
bent
now
on
one
now
on
the
other
arm
of
their
chairs
then
on
the
table
then
back
again
shut
and
opened
their
eyes
and
whispered
to
each
other
one
of
the
gendarmes
several
times
repressed
a
yawn
the
prisoner
kartinkin
never
stopped
moving
his
cheeks
botchkova
sat
quite
still
and
straight
only
now
and
then
scratching
her
head
under
the
kerchief
maslova
sat
immovable
gazing
at
the
reader
only
now
and
then
she
gave
a
slight
start
as
if
wishing
to
reply
blushed
sighed
heavily
and
changed
the
position
of
her
hands
looked
round
and
again
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
reader
nekhludoff
sat
in
the
front
row
on
his
highbacked
chair
without
removing
his
pincenez
and
looked
at
maslova
while
a
complicated
and
fierce
struggle
was
going
on
in
his
soul

the
indictment
ran
as
follows
on
the
17th
of
january
18
in
the
lodginghouse
mauritania
occurred
the
sudden
death
of
the
second
guild
merchant
therapont
emilianovich
smelkoff
of
kourgan
the
local
police
doctor
of
the
fourth
district
certified
that
death
was
due
to
rupture
of
the
heart
owing
to
the
excessive
use
of
alcoholic
liquids
the
body
of
the
said
smelkoff
was
interred
after
several
days
had
elapsed
the
merchant
timokhin
a
fellowtownsman
and
companion
of
the
said
smelkoff
returned
from
st
petersburg
and
hearing
the
circumstances
that
accompanied
the
death
of
the
latter
notified
his
suspicions
that
the
death
was
caused
by
poison
given
with
intent
to
rob
the
said
smelkoff
of
his
money
this
suspicion
was
corroborated
on
inquiry
which
proved
1
that
shortly
before
his
death
the
said
smelkoff
had
received
the
sum
of
3800
roubles
from
the
bank
when
an
inventory
of
the
property
of
the
deceased
was
made
only
312
roubles
and
16
copecks
were
found
2
the
whole
day
and
night
preceding
his
death
the
said
smelkoff
spent
with
lubka
alias
katerina
maslova
at
her
home
and
in
the
lodginghouse
mauritania
which
she
also
visited
at
the
said
smelkoffs
request
during
his
absence
to
get
some
money
which
she
took
out
of
his
portmanteau
in
the
presence
of
the
servants
of
the
lodginghouse
mauritania
euphemia
botchkova
and
simeon
kartinkin
with
a
key
given
her
by
the
said
smelkoff
in
the
portmanteau
opened
by
the
said
maslova
the
said
botchkova
and
kartinkin
saw
packets
of
100rouble
banknotes
3
on
the
said
smelkoffs
return
to
the
lodginghouse
mauritania
together
with
lubka
the
latter
in
accordance
with
the
attendant
kartinkins
advice
gave
the
said
smelkoff
some
white
powder
given
to
her
by
the
said
kartinkin
dissolved
in
brandy
4
the
next
morning
the
said
lubka
alias
katerina
maslova
sold
to
her
mistress
the
witness
kitaeva
a
brothelkeeper
a
diamond
ring
given
to
her
as
she
alleged
by
the
said
smelkoff
5
the
housemaid
of
the
lodginghouse
mauritania
euphemia
botchkova
placed
to
her
account
in
the
local
commercial
bank
1800
roubles
the
postmortem
examination
of
the
body
of
the
said
smelkoff
and
the
chemical
analysis
of
his
intestines
proved
beyond
doubt
the
presence
of
poison
in
the
organism
so
that
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
said
smelkoffs
death
was
caused
by
poisoning
when
crossexamined
the
accused
maslova
botchkova
and
kartinkin
pleaded
not
guilty
deposingmaslova
that
she
had
really
been
sent
by
smelkoff
from
the
brothel
where
she
works
as
she
expresses
it
to
the
lodginghouse
mauritania
to
get
the
merchant
some
money
and
that
having
unlocked
the
portmanteau
with
a
key
given
her
by
the
merchant
she
took
out
40
roubles
as
she
was
told
to
do
and
that
she
had
taken
nothing
more
that
botchkova
and
kartinkin
in
whose
presence
she
unlocked
and
locked
the
portmanteau
could
testify
to
the
truth
of
the
statement
she
gave
this
further
evidencethat
when
she
came
to
the
lodginghouse
for
the
second
time
she
did
at
the
instigation
of
simeon
kartinkin
give
smelkoff
some
kind
of
powder
which
she
thought
was
a
narcotic
in
a
glass
of
brandy
hoping
he
would
fall
asleep
and
that
she
would
be
able
to
get
away
from
him
and
that
smelkoff
having
beaten
her
himself
gave
her
the
ring
when
she
cried
and
threatened
to
go
away
the
accused
euphemia
botchkova
stated
that
she
knew
nothing
about
the
missing
money
that
she
had
not
even
gone
into
smelkoffs
room
but
that
lubka
had
been
busy
there
all
by
herself
that
if
anything
had
been
stolen
it
must
have
been
done
by
lubka
when
she
came
with
the
merchants
key
to
get
his
money
at
this
point
maslova
gave
a
start
opened
her
mouth
and
looked
at
botchkova
when
continued
the
secretary
the
receipt
for
1800
roubles
from
the
bank
was
shown
to
botchkova
and
she
was
asked
where
she
had
obtained
the
money
she
said
that
it
was
her
own
earnings
for
12
years
and
those
of
simeon
whom
she
was
going
to
marry
the
accused
simeon
kartinkin
when
first
examined
confessed
that
he
and
botchkova
at
the
instigation
of
maslova
who
had
come
with
the
key
from

it
equally
among

and
maslova

maslova
again
started
halfrose
from
her
seat
and
blushing
scarlet
began
to
say
something
but
was
stopped
by
the
usher

last
the
secretary
continued
reading
kartinkin
confessed
also
that
he
had
supplied
the
powders
in
order
to
get
smelkoff
to

denied

had
anything
to
do
with
the
stealing
of
the

or
giving
maslova
the
powders

her
of
having
done
it
alone
concerning
the
money
placed
in
the
bank
by
botchkova
he
said
the
same
as
she
that
is
that
the

to

up

his

down
his
sides

from

belonging

then
having
procured
some
arsenic
persuaded
katerina
maslova
to
give
it
to
the
merchant
smelkoff
in
a
glass
of
brandy
which
was
the
cause
of
smelkoffs
death
do
you
plead
guilty
said
the
president
stooping
to
the
right
not
nohow
because
our
business
is
to
attend
on

do
you
plead

quietly
and
firmly
asked
the

cant
do
such
a
thing
because
that
the
usher
again
rushed
up
to
simeon
kartinkin
and
stopped
him
in
a
tragic
whisper
the
president
moved
the
hand
with
which
he
held
the
paper
and
placed
the
elbow
in
a
different
position
with
an
air
that
said
this
is
finished
and
turned

euphemia

of
having
on
the

stolen
some

and
a

out
of
the

and
having

thereby
causing
his
death
do
you
plead

i
am
not
guilty
of
anything
boldly
and
firmly
replied
the
prisoner
i
never
went
near
the
room
but
when
this
baggage
went
in
she
did
the
whole
business
you
will
say
all
this
afterwards
the
president
again
said
quietly
and
firmly
so
you
do
not
plead
guilty
i
did
not
take
the
money
nor
give
the
drink
nor
go
into
the
room
had
i
gone
in
i
should
have
kicked
her
out
so
you
do
not
plead
guilty
never
very
well
katerina
maslova
the
president
began
turning
to
the
third
prisoner
you
are
accused
of
having
come
from
the
brothel
with
the
key
of
the
merchant
smelkoffs
portmanteau
money
and
a
ring
he
said
all
this
like
a
lesson
learned
by
heart
leaning
towards
the
member
on
his
left
who
was
whispering
into
his
ear
that
a
bottle
mentioned
in
the
list
of
the
material
evidence
was
missing
of
having
stolen
out
of
the
portmanteau
money
and
a
ring
he
repeated
and
shared
it
then
returning
to
the
lodging
house
mauritania
with
smelkoff
of
giving
him
poison
in
his
drink
and
thereby
causing
his
death
do
you
plead
guilty
i
am
not
guilty
of
anything
she
began
rapidly
as
i
said
before
i
say
again
i
did
not
take
iti
did
not
take
it
i
did
not
take
anything
and
the
ring
he
gave
me
himself
you
do
not
plead
guilty
of
having
stolen
2500
roubles
asked
the
president
ive
said
i
took
nothing
but
the
40
roubles
well
and
do
you
plead
guilty
of
having
given
the
merchant
smelkoff
a
powder
in
his
drink
yes
that
i
did
only
i
believed
what
they
told
me
that
they
were
sleeping
powders
and
that
no
harm
could
come
of
them
i
never
thought
and
never
wished


god
is
my
witness
i
say
i
never
meant
this
she
said
so
you
do
not
plead
guilty
of
having
stolen
the
money
and
the
ring
from
the
merchant
smelkoff
but
confess
that
you
gave
him
the
powder
said
the
president
well
yes
i
do
confess
this
but
i
thought
they
were
sleeping
powders
i
only
gave
them
to
make
him
sleep
i
never
meant
and
never
thought
of
worse
very
well
said
the
president
evidently
satisfied
with
the
results
gained
now
tell
us
how
it
all
happened
and
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
put
his
folded
hands
on
the
table
tell
us
all
about
it
a
free
and
full
confession
will
be
to
your
advantage
maslova
continued
to
look
at
the
president
in
silence
and
blushing
tell
us
how
it
happened
how
it
happened
maslova
suddenly
began
speaking
quickly
i
came
to
the
lodginghouse
and
was
shown
into
the
room
he
was
there
already
very
drunk
she
pronounced
the
word
he
with
a
look
of
horror
in
her
wideopen
eyes
i
wished
to
go
away
but
he
would
not
let
me
she
stopped
as
if
having
lost
the
thread
or
remembered
some
thing
else
well
and
then
well
what
then
i
remained
a
bit
and
went
home
again
at
this
moment
the
public
prosecutor
raised
himself
a
little
leaning
on
one
elbow
in
an
awkward
manner
you
would
like
to
put
a
question
said
the
president
and
having
received
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
he
made
a
gesture
inviting
the
public
prosecutor
to
speak
i
want
to
ask
was
the
prisoner
previously
acquainted
with
simeon
kartinkin
said
the
public
prosecutor
without
looking
at
maslova
and
having
put
the
question
he
compressed
his
lips
and
frowned
the
president
repeated
the
question
maslova
stared
at
the
public
prosecutor
with
a
frightened
look
with
simeon
yes
she
said
i
should
like
to
know
what
the
prisoners
acquaintance
with
kartinkin
consisted
in
did
they
meet
often
consisted
in



he
invited
me
for
the
lodgers
it
was
not
an
acquaintance
at
all
answered
maslova
anxiously
moving
her
eyes
from
the
president
to
the
public
prosecutor
and
back
to
the
president
i
should
like
to
know
why
kartinkin
invited
only
maslova
and
none
of
the
other
girls
for
the
lodgers
said
the
public
prosecutor
with
halfclosed
eyes
and
a
cunning
mephistophelian
smile
i
dont
know
how
should
i
know
said
maslova
casting
a
frightened
look
round
and
fixing
her
eyes
for
a
moment
on
nekhludoff
he
asked
whom
he
liked
is
it
possible
that
she
has
recognised
me
thought
nekhludoff
and
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
but
maslova
turned
away
without
distinguishing
him
from
the
others
and
again
fixed
her
eyes
anxiously
on
the
public
prosecutor
so
the
prisoner
denies
having
had
any
intimate
relations
with
kartinkin
very
well
i
have
no
more
questions
to
ask
and
the
public
prosecutor
took
his
elbow
off
the
desk
and
began
writing
something
he
was
not
really
noting
anything
down
but
only
going
over
the
letters
of
his
notes
with
a
pen
having
seen
the
procureur
and
leading
advocates
after
putting
a
clever
question
make
a
note
with
which
later
on
to
annihilate
their
adversaries
the
president
did
not
continue
at
once
because
he
was
consulting
the
member
with
the
spectacles
whether
he
was
agreed
that
the
questions
which
had
all
been
prepared
be
forehand
and
written
out
should
be
put
well
what
happened
next
he
then
went
on
i
came
home
looking
a
little
more
boldly
only
at
the
president
and
went
to
bed
hardly
had
i
fallen
asleep
when
one
of
our
girls
bertha
woke
me
go
your
merchant
has
come
again
heshe
again
uttered
the
word
he
with
evident
horrorhe
kept
treating
our
girls
and
then
wanted
to
send
for
more
wine
but
his
money
was
all
gone
and
he
sent
me
to
his
lodgings
and
told
me
where
the
money
was
and
how
much
to
take
so
i
went
the
president
was
whispering
to
the
member
on
his
left
but
in
order
to
appear
as
if
he
had
heard
he
repeated
her
last
words
so
you
went
well
what
next
i
went
and
did
all
he
told
me
went
into
his
room
i
did
not
go
alone
but
called
simeon
kartinkin
and
her
she
said
pointing
to
botchkova
thats
a
lie
i
never
went
in
botchkova
began
but
was
stopped
in
their
presence
i
took
out
four
notes
continued
maslova
frowning
without
looking
at
botchkova
yes
but
did
the
prisoner
notice
again
asked
the
prosecutor
how
much
money
there
was
when
she
was
getting
out
the
40
roubles
maslova
shuddered
when
the
prosecutor
addressed
her
she
did
not
know
why
it
was
but
she
felt
that
he
wished
her
evil
i
did
not
count
it
but
only
saw
some
100rouble
notes
ah
the
prisoner
saw
100rouble
notes
thats
all
well
so
you
brought
back
the
money
continued
the
president
looking
at
the
clock
i
did
well
and
then
then
he
took
me
back
with
him
said
maslova
well
and
how
did
you
give
him
the
powder
in
his
drink
how
did
i
give
it
i
put
them
in
and
gave
it
him
why
did
you
give
it
him
she
did
not
answer
but
sighed
deeply
and
heavily
he
would
not
let
me
go
she
said
after
a
moments
silence
and
i
was
quite
tired
out
and
so
i
went
out
into
the
passage
and
said
to
simeon
if
he
would
only
let
me
go
i
am
so
tired
and
he
said
we
are
also
sick
of
him
we
were
thinking
of
giving
him
a
sleeping
draught
he
will
fall
asleep
and
then
you
can
go
so
i
said
all
right
i
thought
they
were
harmless
and
he
gave
me
the
packet
i
went
in
he
was
lying
behind
the
partition
and
at
once
called
for
brandy
i
took
a
bottle
of
fine
champagne
from
the
table
poured
out
two
glasses
one
for
him
and
one
for
myself
and
put
the
powders
into
his
glass
and
gave
it
him
had
i
known
how
could
i
have
given
them
to
him
well
and
how
did
the
ring
come
into
your
possession
asked
the
president
when
did
he
give
it
you
that
was
when
we
came
back
to
his
lodgings
i
wanted
to
go
away
and
he
gave
me
a
knock
on
the
head
and
broke
my
comb
i
got
angry
and
said
id
go
away
and
he
took
the
ring
off
his
finger
and
gave
it
to
me
so
that
i
should
not
go
she
said
then
the
public
prosecutor
again
slightly
raised
himself
and
putting
on
an
air
of
simplicity
asked
permission
to
put
a
few
more
questions
and
having
received
it
bending
his
head
over
his
embroidered
collar
he
said
i
should
like
to
know
how
long
the
prisoner
remained
in
the
merchant
smelkoffs
room
maslova
again
seemed
frightened
and
she
again
looked
anxiously
from
the
public
prosecutor
to
the
president
and
said
hurriedly
i
do
not
remember
how
long
yes
but
does
the
prisoner
remember
if
she
went
anywhere
else
in
the
lodginghouse
after
she
left
smelkoff
maslova
considered
for
a
moment
yes
i
did
go
into
an
empty
room
next
to
his
yes
and
why
did
you
go
in
asked
the
public
prosecutor
forgetting
himself
and
addressing
her
directly
i
went
in
to
rest
a
bit
and
to
wait
for
an
isvostchik
and
was
kartinkin
in
the
room
with
the
prisoner
or
not
he
came
in
why
did
he
come
in
there
was
some
of
the
merchants
brandy
left
and
we
finished
it
together
oh
finished
it
together
very
well
and
did
the
prisoner
talk
to
kartinkin
and
if
so
what
about
maslova
suddenly
frowned
blushed
very
red
and
said
hurriedly
what
about
i
did
not
talk
about
anything
and
thats
all
i
know
do
what
you
like
with
me
i
am
not
guilty
and
thats
all
i
have
nothing
more
to
ask
said
the
prosecutor
and
drawing
up
his
shoulders
in
an
unnatural
manner
began
writing
down
as
the
prisoners
own
evidence
in
the
notes
for
his
speech
that
she
had
been
in
the
empty
room
with
kartinkin
there
was
a
short
silence
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
i
have
told
everything
she
said
with
a
sigh
and
sat
down
then
the
president
noted
something
down
and
having
listened
to
something
that
the
member
on
his
left
whispered
to
him
he
announced
a
tenminutes
interval
rose
hurriedly
and
left
the
court
the
communication
he
had
received
from
the
tall
bearded
member
with
the
kindly
eyes
was
that
the
member
having
felt
a
slight
stomach
derangement
wished
to
do
a
little
massage
and
to
take
some
drops
and
this
was
why
an
interval
was
made
when
the
judges
had
risen
the
advocates
the
jury
and
the
witnesses
also
rose
with
the
pleasant
feeling
that
part
of
the
business
was
finished
and
began
moving
in
different
directions
nekhludoff
went
into
the
jurys
room
and
sat
down
by
the
window
chapter
xii
twelve
years
before
yes
this
was
katusha
the
relations
between
nekhludoff
and
katusha
had
been
the
following
nekhludoff
first
saw
katusha
when
he
was
a
student
in
his
third
year
at
the
university
and
was
preparing
an
essay
on
land
tenure
during
the
summer
vacation
which
he
passed
with
his
aunts
until
then
he
had
always
lived
in
summer
with
his
mother
and
sister
on
his
mothers
large
estate
near
moscow
but
that
year
his
sister
had
married
and
his
mother
had
gone
abroad
to
a
wateringplace
and
he
having
his
essay
to
write
resolved
to
spend
the
summer
with
his
aunts
it
was
very
quiet
in
their
secluded
estate
and
there
was
nothing
to
distract
his
mind
his
aunts
loved
their
nephew
and
heir
very
tenderly
and
he
too
was
fond
of
them
and
of
their
simple
oldfashioned
life
during
that
summer
on
his
aunts
estate
nekhludoff
passed
through
that
blissful
state
of
existence
when
a
young
man
for
the
first
time
without
guidance
from
any
one
outside
realises
all
the
beauty
and
significance
of
life
and
the
importance
of
the
task
allotted
in
it
to
man
when
he
grasps
the
possibility
of
unlimited
advance
towards
perfection
for
ones
self
and
for
all
the
world
and
gives
himself
to
this
task
not
only
hopefully
but
with
full
conviction
of
attaining
to
the
perfection
he
imagines
in
that
year
while
still
at
the
university
he
had
read
spencers
social
statics
and
spencers
views
on
landholding
especially
impressed
him
as
he
himself
was
heir
to
large
estates
his
father
had
not
been
rich
but
his
mother
had
received
10000
acres
of
land
for
her
dowry
at
that
time
he
fully
realised
all
the
cruelty
and
injustice
of
private
property
in
land
and
being
one
of
those
to
whom
a
sacrifice
to
the
demands
of
conscience
gives
the
highest
spiritual
enjoyment
he
decided
not
to
retain
property
rights
but
to
give
up
to
the
peasant
labourers
the
land
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
it
was
on
this
land
question
he
wrote
his
essay
he
arranged
his
life
on
his
aunts
estate
in
the
following
manner
he
got
up
very
early
sometimes
at
three
oclock
and
before
sunrise
went
through
the
morning
mists
to
bathe
in
the
river
under
the
hill
he
returned
while
the
dew
still
lay
on
the
grass
and
the
flowers
sometimes
having
finished
his
coffee
he
sat
down
with
his
books
of
reference
and
his
papers
to
write
his
essay
but
very
often
instead
of
reading
or
writing
he
left
home
again
and
wandered
through
the
fields
and
the
woods
before
dinner
he
lay
down
and
slept
somewhere
in
the
garden
at
dinner
he
amused
and
entertained
his
aunts
with
his
bright
spirits
then
he
rode
on
horseback
or
went
for
a
row
on
the
river
and
in
the
evening
he
again
worked
at
his
essay
or
sat
reading
or
playing
patience
with
his
aunts
his
joy
in
life
was
so
great
that
it
agitated
him
and
kept
him
awake
many
a
night
especially
when
it
was
moonlight
so
that
instead
of
sleeping
he
wandered
about
in
the
garden
till
dawn
alone
with
his
dreams
and
fancies
and
so
peacefully
and
happily
he
lived
through
the
first
month
of
his
stay
with
his
aunts
taking
no
particular
notice
of
their
halfward
halfservant
the
blackeyed
quickfooted
katusha
then
at
the
age
of
nineteen
nekhludoff
brought
up
under
his
mothers
wing
was
still
quite
pure
if
a
woman
figured
in
his
dreams
at
all
it
was
only
as
a
wife
all
the
other
women
who
according
to
his
ideas
he
could
not
marry
were
not
women
for
him
but
human
beings
but
on
ascension
day
that
summer
a
neighbour
of
his
aunts
and
her
family
consisting
of
two
young
daughters
a
schoolboy
and
a
young
artist
of
peasant
origin
who
was
staying
with
them
came
to
spend
the
day
after
tea
they
all
went
to
play
in
the
meadow
in
front
of
the
house
where
the
grass
had
already
been
mown
they
played
at
the
game
of
gorelki
and
katusha
joined
them
running
about
and
changing
partners
several
times
nekhludoff
caught
katusha
and
she
became
his
partner
up
to
this
time
he
had
liked
katushas
looks
but
the
possibility
of
any
nearer
relations
with
her
had
never
entered
his
mind
impossible
to
catch
those
two
said
the
merry
young
artist
whose
turn
it
was
to
catch
and
who
could
run
very
fast
with
his
short
muscular
legs
you
and
not
catch
us
said
katusha
one
two
three
and
the
artist
clapped
his
hands
katusha
hardly
restraining
her
laughter
changed
places
with
nekhludoff
behind
the
artists
back
and
pressing
his
large
hand
with
her
little
rough
one
and
rustling
with
her
starched
petticoat
ran
to
the
left
nekhludoff
ran
fast
to
the
right
trying
to
escape
from
the
artist
but
when
he
looked
round
he
saw
the
artist
running
after
katusha
who
kept
well
ahead
her
firm
young
legs
moving
rapidly
there
was
a
lilac
bush
in
front
of
them
and
katusha
made
a
sign
with
her
head
to
nekhludoff
to
join
her
behind
it
for
if
they
once
clasped
hands
again
they
were
safe
from
their
pursuer
that
being
a
rule
of
the
game
he
understood
the
sign
and
ran
behind
the
bush
but
he
did
not
know
that
there
was
a
small
ditch
overgrown
with
nettles
there
he
stumbled
and
fell
into
the
nettles
already
wet
with
dew
stinging
his
bands
but
rose
immediately
laughing
at
his
mishap
katusha
with
her
eyes
black
as
sloes
her
face
radiant
with
joy
was
flying
towards
him
and
they
caught
hold
of
each
others
hands
got
stung
i
daresay
she
said
arranging
her
hair
with
her
free
hand
breathing
fast
and
looking
straight
up
at
him
with
a
glad
pleasant
smile
i
did
not
know
there
was
a
ditch
here
he
answered
smiling
also
and
keeping
her
hand
in
his
she
drew
nearer
to
him
and
he
himself
not
knowing
how
it
happened
stooped
towards
her
she
did
not
move
away
and
he
pressed
her
hand
tight
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
there
youve
done
it
she
said
and
freeing
her
hand
with
a
swift
movement
ran
away
from
him
then
breaking
two
branches
of
white
lilac
from
which
the
blossoms
were
already
falling
she
began
fanning
her
hot
face
with
them
then
with
her
head
turned
back
to
him
she
walked
away
swaying
her
arms
briskly
in
front
of
her
and
joined
the
other
players
after
this
there
grew
up
between
nekhludoff
and
katusha
those
peculiar
relations
which
often
exist
between
a
pure
young
man
and
girl
who
are
attracted
to
each
other
when
katusha
came
into
the
room
or
even
when
he
saw
her
white
apron
from
afar
everything
brightened
up
in
nekhludoffs
eyes
as
when
the
sun
appears
everything
becomes
more
interesting
more
joyful
more
important
the
whole
of
life
seemed
full
of
gladness
and
she
felt
the
same
but
it
was
not
only
katushas
presence
that
had
this
effect
on
nekhludoff
the
mere
thought
that
katusha
existed
and
for
her
that
nekhludoff
existed
had
this
effect
when
he
received
an
unpleasant
letter
from
his
mother
or
could
not
get
on
with
his
essay
or
felt
the
unreasoning
sadness
that
young
people
are
often
subject
to
he
had
only
to
remember
katusha
and
that
he
should
see
her
and
it
all
vanished
katusha
had
much
work
to
do
in
the
house
but
she
managed
to
get
a
little
leisure
for
reading
and
nekhludoff
gave
her
dostoievsky
and
tourgeneff
whom
he
had
just
read
himself
to
read
she
liked
tourgeneffs
lull
best
they
had
talks
at
moments
snatched
when
meeting
in
the
passage
on
the
veranda
or
the
yard
and
sometimes
in
the
room
of
his
aunts
old
servant
matrona
pavlovna
with
whom
he
sometimes
used
to
drink
tea
and
where
katusha
used
to
work
these
talks
in
matrona
pavlovnas
presence
were
the
pleasantest
when
they
were
alone
it
was
worse
their
eyes
at
once
began
to
say
something
very
different
and
far
more
important
than
what
their
mouths
uttered
their
lips
puckered
and
they
felt
a
kind
of
dread
of
something
that
made
them
part
quickly
these
relations
continued
between
nekhludoff
and
katusha
during
the
whole
time
of
his
first
visit
to
his
aunts
they
noticed
it
and
became
frightened
and
even
wrote
to
princess
elena
ivanovna
nekhludoffs
mother
his
aunt
mary
ivanovna
was
afraid
dmitri
would
form
an
intimacy
with
katusha
but
her
fears
were
groundless
for
nekhludoff
himself
hardly
conscious
of
it
loved
katusha
loved
her
as
the
pure
love
and
therein
lay
his
safetyhis
and
hers
he
not
only
did
not
feel
any
desire
to
possess
her
but
the
very
thought
of
it
filled
him
with
horror
the
fears
of
the
more
poetical
sophia
ivanovna
that
dmitri
with
his
thoroughgoing
resolute
character
having
fallen
in
love
with
a
girl
might
make
up
his
mind
to
marry
her
without
considering
either
her
birth
or
her
station
had
more
ground
had
nekhludoff
at
that
time
been
conscious
of
his
love
for
katusha
and
especially
if
he
had
been
told
that
he
could
on
no
account
join
his
life
with
that
of
a
girl
in
her
position
it
might
have
easily
happened
that
with
his
usual
straightforwardness
he
would
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
could
be
no
possible
reason
for
him
not
to
marry
any
girl
whatever
as
long
as
he
loved
her
but
his
aunts
did
not
mention
their
fears
to
him
and
when
he
left
he
was
still
unconscious
of
his
love
for
katusha
he
was
sure
that
what
he
felt
for
katusha
was
only
one
of
the
manifestations
of
the
joy
of
life
that
filled
his
whole
being
and
that
this
sweet
merry
little
girl
shared
this
joy
with
him
yet
when
he
was
going
away
and
katusha
stood
with
his
aunts
in
the
porch
and
looked
after
him
her
dark
slightlysquinting
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
felt
after
all
that
he
was
leaving
something
beautiful
precious
something
which
would
never
reoccur
and
he
grew
very
sad
goodbye
katusha
he
said
looking
across

he
was

into

away
into

chapter
xiii
life
in
the
army
after
that
nekhludoff
did
not
see
katusha
for
more
than
three
years
when
he
saw
her
again
he
had
just
been
promoted
to
the
rank
of
officer
and
was
going
to
join
his
regiment
on
the
way
he
came
to
spend
a
few
days
with
his
aunts
being
now
a
very
different
young
man
from
the
one
who
had
spent
the
summer
with
them
three
years
before
he
then
had
been
an
honest
unselfish
lad
ready
to
sacrifice
himself
for
any
good
cause
now
he
was
depraved
and
selfish
and
thought
only
of
his
own
enjoyment
then
gods
world
seemed
a
mystery
which
he
tried
enthusiastically
and
joyfully
to
solve
now
everything
in
life
seemed
clear
and
simple
defined
by
the
conditions
of
the
life
he
was
leading
then
he
had
felt
the
importance
of
and
had
need
of
intercourse
with
nature
and
with
those
who
had
lived
and
thought
and
felt
before
himphilosophers
and
poets
what
he
now
considered
necessary
and
important
were
human
institutions
and
intercourse
with
his
comrades
then
women
seemed
mysterious
and
charmingcharming
by
the
very
mystery
that
enveloped
them
now
the
purpose
of
women
all
women
except
those
of
his
own
family
and
the
wives
of
his
friends
was
a
very
definite
one
women
were
the
best
means
towards
an
already
experienced
enjoyment
then
money
was
not
needed
and
he
did
not
require
even
onethird
of
what
his
mother
allowed
him
but
now
this
allowance
of
1500
roubles
a
month
did
not
suffice
and
he
had
already
had
some
unpleasant
talks
about
it
with
his
mother
then
he
had
looked
on
his
spirit
as
the
i
now
it
was
his
healthy
strong
animal
i
that
he
looked
upon
as
himself
and
all
this
terrible
change
had
come
about
because
he
had
ceased
to
believe
himself
and
had
taken
to
believing
others
this
he
had
done
because
it
was
too
difficult
to
live
believing
ones
self
believing
ones
self
one
had
to
decide
every
question
not
in
favour
of
ones
own
animal
life
which
is
always
seeking
for
easy
gratifications
but
almost
in
every
case
against
it
believing
others
there
was
nothing
to
decide
everything
had
been
decided
already
and
decided
always
in
favour
of
the
animal
i
and
against
the
spiritual
nor
was
this
all
believing
in
his
own
self
he
was
always
exposing
himself
to
the
censure
of
those
around
him
believing
others
he
had
their
approval
so
when
nekhludoff
had
talked
of
the
serious
matters
of
life
of
god
truth
riches
and
poverty
all
round
him
thought
it
out
of
place
and
even
rather
funny
and
his
mother
and
aunts
called
him
with
kindly
irony
notre
cher
philosophe
but
when
he
read
novels
told
improper
anecdotes
went
to
see
funny
vaudevilles
in
the
french
theatre
and
gaily
repeated
the
jokes
everybody
admired
and
encouraged
him
when
he
considered
it
right
to
limit
his
needs
wore
an
old
overcoat
took
no
wine
everybody
thought
it
strange
and
looked
upon
it
as
a
kind
of
showing
off
but
when
he
spent
large
sums
on
hunting
or
on
furnishing
a
peculiar
and
luxurious
study
for
himself
everybody
admired
his
taste
and
gave
him
expensive
presents
to
encourage
his
hobby
while
he
kept
pure
and
meant
to
remain
so
till
he
married
his
friends
prayed
for
his
health
and
even
his
mother
was
not
grieved
but
rather
pleased
when
she
found
out
that
he
had
become
a
real
man
and
had
gained
over
some
french
woman
from
his
friend
as
to
the
episode
with
katusha
the
princess
could
not
without
horror
think
that
he
might
possibly
have
married
her
in
the
same
way
when
nekhludoff
came
of
age
and
gave
the
small
estate
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
to
the
peasants
because
he
considered
the
holding
of
private
property
in
land
wrong
this
step
filled
his
mother
and
relations
with
dismay
and
served
as
an
excuse
for
making
fun
of
him
to
all
his
relatives
he
was
continually
told
that
these
peasants
after
they
had
received
the
land
got
no
richer
but
on
the
contrary
poorer
having
opened
three
publichouses
and
left
off
doing
any
work
but
when
nekhludoff
entered
the
guards
and
spent
and
gambled
away
so
much
with
his
aristocratic
companions
that
elena
ivanovna
his
mother
had
to
draw
on
her
capital
she
was
hardly
pained
considering
it
quite
natural
and
even
good
that
wild
oats
should
be
sown
at
an
early
age
and
in
good
company
as
her
son
was
doing
at
first
nekhludoff
struggled
but
all
that
he
had
considered
good
while
he
had
faith
in
himself
was
considered
bad
by
others
and
what
he
had
considered
evil
was
looked
upon
as
good
by
those
among
whom
he
lived
and
the
struggle
grew
too
hard
and
at
last
nekhludoff
gave
in
ie
left
off
believing
himself
and
began
believing
others
at
first
this
giving
up
of
faith
in
himself
was
unpleasant
but
it
did
not
long
continue
to
be
so
at
that
time
he
acquired
the
habit
of
smoking
and
drinking
wine
and
soon
got
over
this
unpleasant
feeling
and
even
felt
great
relief
nekhludoff
with
his
passionate
nature
gave
himself
thoroughly
to
the
new
way
of
life
so
approved
of
by
all
those
around
and
he
entirely
stifled
the
inner
voice
which
demanded
something
different
this
began
after
he
moved
to
st
petersburg
and
reached
its
highest
point
when
he
entered
the
army
military
life
in
general
depraves
men
it
places
them
in
conditions
of
complete
idleness
ie
absence
of
all
useful
work
frees
them
of
their
common
human
duties
which
it
replaces
by
merely
conventional
ones
to
the
honour
of
the
regiment
the
uniform
the
flag
and
while
giving
them
on
the
one
hand
absolute
power
over
other
men
also
puts
them
into
conditions
of
servile
obedience
to
those
of
higher
rank
than
themselves
but
when
to
the
usual
depraving
influence
of
military
service
with
its
honours
uniforms
flags
its
permitted
violence
and
murder
there
is
added
the
depraving
influence
of
riches
and
nearness
to
and
intercourse
with
members
of
the
imperial
family
as
is
the
case
in
the
chosen
regiment
of
the
guards
in
which
all
the
officers
are
rich
and
of
good
family
then
this
depraving
influence
creates
in
the
men
who
succumb
to
it
a
perfect
mania
of
selfishness
and
this
mania
of
selfishness
attacked
nekhludoff
from
the
moment
he
entered
the
army
and
began
living
in
the
way
his
companions
lived
he
had
no
occupation
whatever
except
to
dress
in
a
uniform
splendidly
made
and
well
brushed
by
other
people
and
with
arms
also
made
and
cleaned
and
handed
to
him
by
others
ride
to
reviews
on
a
fine
horse
which
had
been
bred
broken
in
and
fed
by
others
there
with
other
men
like
himself
he
had
to
wave
a
sword
shoot
off
guns
and
teach
others
to
do
the
same
he
had
no
other
work
and
the
highlyplaced
persons
young
and
old
the
tsar
and
those
near
him
not
only
sanctioned
his
occupation
but
praised
and
thanked
him
for
it
after
this
was
done
it
was
thought
important
to
eat
and
particularly
to
drink
in
officers
clubs
or
the
salons
of
the
best
restaurants
squandering
large
sums
of
money
which
came
from
some
invisible
source
then
theatres
ballets
women
then
again
riding
on
horseback
waving
of
swords
and
shooting
and
again
the
squandering
of
money
the
wine
cards
and
women
this
kind
of
life
acts
on
military
men
even
more
depravingly
than
on
others
because
if
any
other
than
a
military
man
lead
such
a
life
he
cannot
help
being
ashamed
of
it
in
the
depth
of
his
heart
a
military
man
is
on
the
contrary
proud
of
a
life
of
this
kind
especially
at
war
time
and
nekhludoff
had
entered
the
army
just
after
war
with
the
turks
had
been
declared
we
are
prepared
to
sacrifice
our
lives
at
the
wars
and
therefore
a
gay
reckless
life
is
not
only
pardonable
but
absolutely
necessary
for
us
and
so
we
lead
it
such
were
nekhludoffs
confused
thoughts
at
this
period
of
his
existence
and
he
felt
all
the
time
the
delight
of
being
free
of
the
moral
barriers
he
had
formerly
set
himself
and
the
state
he
lived
in
was
that
of
a
chronic
mania
of
selfishness
he
was
in
this
state
when
after
three
years
absence
he
came
again
to
visit
his
aunts
chapter
xiv
the
second
meeting
with
maslova
nekhludoff
went
to
visit
his
aunts
because
their
estate
lay
near
the
road
he
had
to
travel
in
order
to
join
his
regiment
which
had
gone
forward
because
they
had
very
warmly
asked
him
to
come
and
especially
because
he
wanted
to
see
katusha
perhaps
in
his
heart
he
had
already
formed
those
evil
designs
against
katusha
which
his
now
uncontrolled
animal
self
suggested
to
him
but
he
did
not
acknowledge
this
as
his
intention
but
only
wished
to
go
back
to
the
spot
where
he
had
been
so
happy
to
see
his
rather
funny
but
dear
kindhearted
old
aunts
who
always
without
his
noticing
it
surrounded
him
with
an
atmosphere
of
love
and
admiration
and
to
see
sweet
katusha
of
whom
he
had
retained
so
pleasant
a
memory
he
arrived
at
the
end
of
march
on
good
friday
after
the
thaw
had
set
in
it
was
pouring
with
rain
so
that
he
had
not
a
dry
thread
on
him
and
was
feeling
very
cold
but
yet
vigorous
and
full
of
spirits
as
always
at
that
time
is
she
still
with
them
he
thought
as
he
drove
into
the
familiar
oldfashioned
courtyard
surrounded
by
a
low
brick
wall
and
now
filled
with
snow
off
the
roofs
he
expected
she
would
come
out
when
she
heard
the
sledge
bells
but
she
did
not
two
barefooted
women
with
pails
and
tuckedup
skirts
who
had
evidently
been
scrubbing
the
floors
came
out
of
the
side
door
she
was
not
at
the
front
door
either
and
only
tikhon
the
manservant
with
his
apron
on
evidently
also
busy
cleaning
came
out
into
the
front
porch
his
aunt
sophia
ivanovna
alone
met
him
in
the
anteroom
she
had
a
silk
dress
on
and
a
cap
on
her
head
both
aunts
had
been
to
church
and
had
received
communion

in
russia
to
congratulate
those
who

nekhludoff

directly
came
the
sound
of
a
wellknown
pleasant
voice
from
the
passage
and
nekhludoffs
heart
cried
out
shes
here
and
it
was
as
if
the
sun
had
come
out
from
behind
the
clouds
nekhludoff
followed
by
tikhon
went
gaily
to
his
old
room
to
change
his
things
he
felt
inclined
to
ask
tikhon
about
katusha
how
she
was
what
she
was
doing
was
she
not
going
to
be
married
but
tikhon
was
so
respectful
and
at
the
same
time
so
severe
insisted
so
firmly
on
pouring
the
water
out
of
the
jug
for
him
that
nekhludoff
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
ask
him
about
katusha
but
only
inquired
about
tikhons
grandsons
about
the
old
socalled
brothers
horse
and
about
the
dog
polkan
all
were
alive
except
polkan
who
had
gone
mad
the
summer
before
when
he
had
taken
off
all
his
wet
things
and
just
begun
to
dress
again
nekhludoff
heard
quick
familiar
footsteps
and
a
knock
at
the
door
nekhludoff
knew
the
steps
and
also
the
knock
no
one
but
she
walked
and
knocked
like
that
having
thrown
his
wet
greatcoat
over
his
shoulders
he
opened
the
door
come
in
it
was
she
katusha
the
same
only
sweeter
than
before
the
slightly
squinting
naive
black
eyes
looked
up
in
the
same
old
way
now
as
then
she
had
on
a
white
apron
she
brought
him
from
his
aunts
a
piece
of
scented
soap
with
the
wrapper
just
taken
off
and
two
towelsone
a
long
russian
embroidered
one
the
other
a
bath
towel
the
unused
soap
with
the
stamped
inscription
the
towels
and
her
own
self
all
were
equally
clean
fresh
undefiled
and
pleasant
the
irrepressible
smile
of
joy
at
the
sight
of
him
made
the
sweet
firm
lips
pucker
up
as
of
old
how
do
you
do
dmitri
ivanovitch
she
uttered
with
difficulty
her
face
suffused
with
a
rosy
blush
goodmorning
how
do
you
do
he
said
also
blushing
alive
and
well
yes
the
lord
be
thanked
and
here
is
your
favorite
pink
soap
and
towels
from
your
aunts
she
said
putting
the
soap
on
the
table
and
hanging
the
towels
over
the
back
of
a
chair
there
is
everything
here
said
tikhon
defending
the
visitors
independence
and
pointing
to
nekhludoffs
open
dressing
case
filled
with
brushes
perfume
fixatoire
a
great
many
bottles
with
silver
lids
and
all
sorts
of
toilet
appliances
thank
my
aunts
please
oh
how
glad
i
am
to
be
here
said
nekhludoff
his
heart
filling
with
light
and
tenderness
as
of
old
she
only
smiled
in
answer
to
these
words
and
went
out
the
aunts
who
had
always
loved
nekhludoff
welcomed
him
this
time
more
warmly
than
ever
dmitri
was
going
to
the
war
where
he
might
be
wounded
or
killed
and
this
touched
the
old
aunts
nekhludoff
had
arranged
to
stay
only
a
day
and
night
with
his
aunts
but
when
he
had
seen
katusha
he
agreed
to
stay
over
easter
with
them
and
telegraphed
to
his
friend
schonbock
whom
he
was
to
have
joined
in
odessa
that
he
should
come
and
meet
him
at
his
aunts
instead
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
katusha
nekhludoffs
old
feelings
toward
her
awoke
again
now
just
as
then
he
could
not
see
her
white
apron
without
getting
excited
he
could
not
listen
to
her
steps
her
voice
her
laugh
without
a
feeling
of
joy
he
could
not
look
at
her
eyes
black
as
sloes
without
a
feeling
of
tenderness
especially
when
she
smiled
and
above
all
he
could
not
notice
without
agitation
how
she
blushed
when
they
met
he
felt
he
was
in
love
but
not
as
before
when
this
love
was
a
kind
of
mystery
to
him
and
he
would
not
own
even
to
himself
that
he
loved
and
when
he
was
persuaded
that
one
could
love
only
once
now
he
knew
he
was
in
love
and
was
glad
of
it
and
knew
dimly
what
this
love
consisted
of
and
what
it
might
lead
to
though
he
sought
to
conceal
it
even
from
himself
in
nekhludoff
as
in
every
man
there
were
two
beings
one
the
spiritual
seeking
only
that
kind
of
happiness
for
him
self
which
should
tend
towards
the
happiness
of
all
the
other
the
animal
man
seeking
only
his
own
happiness
and
ready
to
sacrifice
to
it
the
happiness
of
the
rest
of
the
world
at
this
period
of
his
mania
of
selflove
brought
on
by
life
in
petersburg
and
in
the
army
this
animal
man
ruled
supreme
and
completely
crushed
the
spiritual
man
in
him
but
when
he
saw
katusha
and
experienced
the
same
feelings
as
he
had
had
three
years
before
the
spiritual
man
in
him
raised
its
head
once
more
and
began
to
assert
its
rights
and
up
to
easter
during
two
whole
days
an
unconscious
ceaseless
inner
struggle
went
on
in
him
he
knew
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
that
he
ought
to
go
away
that
there
was
no
real
reason
for
staying
on
with
his
aunts
knew
that
no
good
could
come
of
it
and
yet
it
was
so
pleasant
so
delightful
that
he
did
not
honestly
acknowledge
the
facts
to
himself
and
stayed
on
on
easter
eve
the
priest
and
the
deacon
who
came
to
the
house
to
say
mass
had
had
so
they
said
the
greatest
difficulty
in
getting
over
the
three
miles
that
lay
between
the
church
and
the
old
ladies
house
coming
across
the
puddles
and
the
bare
earth
in
a
sledge
nekhludoff
attended
the
mass
with
his
aunts
and
the
servants
and
kept
looking
at
katusha
who
was
near
the
door
and
brought
in
the
censers
for
the
priests
then
having
given
the
priests
and
his
aunts
the
easter
kiss
though
it
was
not
midnight
and
therefore
not
easter
yet
he
was
already
going
to
bed
when
he
heard
the
old
servant
matrona
pavlovna
preparing
to
go
to
the
church
to
get
the
koulitch
and
paski
easter
cakes
blest
after
the
midnight
service
i
shall
go
too
he
thought
the
road
to
the
church
was
impassable
either
in
a
sledge
or
on
wheels
so
nekhludoff
who
behaved
in
his
aunts
house
just
as
he
did
at
home
ordered
the
old
horse
the
brothers
horse
to
be
saddled
and
instead
of
going
to
bed
he
put
on
his
gay
uniform
a
pair
of
tightfitting
riding
breeches
and
his
overcoat
and
got
on
the
old
overfed
and
heavy
horse
which
neighed
continually
all
the
way
as
he
rode
in
the
dark
through
the
puddles
and
snow
to
the
church
chapter
xv
the
early
mass
for
nekhludoff
this
early
mass
remained
for
ever
after
one
of
the
brightest
and
most
vivid
memories
of
his
life
when
he
rode
out
of
the
darkness
broken
only
here
and
there
by
patches
of
white
snow
into
the
churchyard
illuminated
by
a
row
of
lamps
around
the
church
the
service
had
already
begun
the
peasants
recognising
mary
ivanovnas
nephew
led
his
horse
which
was
pricking
up
its
ears
at
the
sight
of
the
lights
to
a
dry
place
where
he
could
get
off
put
it
up
for
him
and
showed
him
into
the
church
which
was
full
of
people
on
the
right
stood
the
peasants
the
old
men
in
homespun
coats
and
clean
white
linen
bands
long
strips
of

worn
by
the

instead
of

round

legs
the
young
men
in
new
cloth
coats
brightcoloured

round
their
waists
and
topboots

the

dressed

quietly
stood
behind
them
with
white
kerchiefs
homespun
coats

skirts
of
dark
homespun
material
and
shoes
on
their
feet
gailydressed
children
their
hair
well
oiled
went
in
and
out
among
them
the
men
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
bowed
down
and
raised
their
heads
again
shaking
back
their
hair
the
women
especially
the
old
ones
fixed
their
eyes
on
an
icon
surrounded
with
candies
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
firmly
pressing
their
folded
fingers
to
the
kerchief
on
their
foreheads
to
their
shoulders
and
their
stomachs
and
whispering
something
stooped
or
knelt
down
the
children
imitating
the
grownup
people
prayed
earnestly
when
they
knew
that
they
were
being
observed
the
gilt
case
containing
the
icon
glittered
illuminated
on
all
sides
by
tall
candles
ornamented
with
golden
spirals
the
candelabra
was
filled
with
tapers
and
from
the
choir
sounded
most
merry
tunes
sung
by
amateur
choristers
with
bellowing
bass
and
shrill
boys
voices
among
them
nekhludoff
passed
up
to
the
front
in
the
middle
of
the
church
stood
the
aristocracy
of
the
place
a
landed
proprietor
with
his
wife
and
son
the
latter
dressed
in
a
sailors
suit
the
police
officer
the
telegraph
clerk
a
tradesman
in
topboots
and
the
village
elder
with
a
medal
on
his
breast
and
to
the
right
of
the
ambo
just
behind
the
landed
proprietors
wife
stood
matrona
pavlovna
in
a
lilac
dress
and
fringed
shawl
and
katusha
in
a
white
dress
with
a
tucked
bodice
blue
sash
and
red
bow
in
her
black
hair
everything
seemed
festive
solemn
bright
and
beautiful
the
priest
in
his
silver
cloth
vestments
with
gold
crosses
the
deacon
the
clerk
and
chanter

and
gold
surplices
the
amateur
choristers
in
their
best
clothes
with
their
welloiled
hair
the
merry
tunes
of
the
holiday
hymns
that
sounded
like
dance
music
and
the
continual
blessing
of
the
people
by
the
priests
who
held
candles
decorated
with
flowers
and
repeated
the
cry
of
christ
is
risen
christ
is
risen
all
was
beautiful
but
above
all
katusha
in
her
white
dress
blue
sash
and
the
red
bow
on
her
black
head
her
eyes
beaming
with
rapture
nekhludoff
knew
that
she
felt
his
presence
without
looking
at
him
he
noticed
this
as
he
passed
her
walking
up
to
the
altar
he
had
nothing
to
tell
her
but
he
invented
something
to
say
and
whispered
as
he
passed
her
aunt
told
me
that
she
would
break
her
fast
after
the
late
mass
the
young
blood
rushed
up
to
katushas
sweet
face
as
it
always
did
when
she
looked
at
him
the
black
eyes
laughing
and
full
of
joy
gazed
naively
up
and
remained
fixed
on
nekhludoff
i
know
she
said
with
a
smile
at
this
moment
the
clerk
was
going
out
with
a
copper
coffeepot
coffeepots
are
often
used
for
holding
holy
water
in
russia
of
holy
water
in
his
hand
and
not
noticing
katusha
brushed
her
with
his
surplice
evidently
he
brushed
against
katusha
through
wishing
to
pass
nekhludoff
at
a
respectful
distance
and
nekhludoff
was
surprised
that
he
the
clerk
did
not
understand
that
everything
here
yes
and
in
all
the
world
only
existed
for
katusha
and
that
everything
else
might
remain
unheeded
only
not
she
because
she
was
the
centre
of
all
for
her
the
gold
glittered
round
the
icons
for
her
all
these
candles
in
candelabra
and
candlesticks
were
alight
for
her
were
sung
these
joyful
hymns
behold
the
passover
of
the
lord
rejoice
o
ye
people
allall
that
was
good
in
the
world
was
for
her
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
katusha
was
aware
that
it
was
all
for
her
when
he
looked
at
her
wellshaped
figure
the
tucked
white
dress
the
wrapt
joyous
expression
of
her
face
by
which
he
knew
that
just
exactly
the
same
that
was
singing
in
his
own
soul
was
also
singing
in
hers
in
the
interval
between
the
early
and
the
late
mass
nekhludoff
left
the
church
the
people
stood
aside
to
let
him
pass
and
bowed
some
knew
him
others
asked
who
he
was
he
stopped
on
the
steps
the
beggars
standing
there
came
clamouring
round
him
and
he
gave
them
all
the
change
he
had
in
his
purse
and
went
down
it
was
dawning
but
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
the
people
grouped
round
the
graves
in
the
churchyard
katusha
had
remained
inside
nekhludoff
stood
waiting
for
her
the
people
continued
coming
out
clattering
with
their
nailed
boots
on
the
stone
steps
and
dispersing
over
the
churchyard
a
very
old
man
with
shaking
head
his
aunts
cook
stopped
nekhludoff
in
order
to
give
him
the
easter
kiss
his
old
wife
took
an
egg
dyed
yellow
out
of
her
handkerchief
and
gave
it
to
nekhludoff
and
a
smiling
young
peasant
in
a
new
coat
and
green
belt
also
came
up
christ
is
risen
he
said
with
laughing
eyes
and
coming
close
to
nekhludoff
he
enveloped
him
in
his
peculiar
but
pleasant
peasant
smell
and
tickling
him
with
his
curly
beard
kissed
him
three
times
straight
on
the
mouth
with
his
firm
fresh
lips
while
the
peasant
was
kissing
nekhludoff
and
giving
him
a
dark
brown
egg
the
lilac
dress
of
matrona
pavlovna
and
the
dear
black
head
with
the
red
bow
appeared
katusha
caught
sight
of
him
over
the
heads
of
those
in
front
of
her
and
he
saw
how
her
face
brightened
up
she
had
come
out
with
matrona
pavlovna
on
to
the
porch
and
stopped
there
distributing
alms
to
the
beggars
a
beggar
with
a
red
scab
in
place
of
a
nose
came
up
to
katusha
she
gave
him
something
drew
nearer
him
and
evincing
no
sign
of
disgust
but
her
eyes
still
shining
with
joy
kissed
him
three
times
and
while
she
was
doing
this
her
eyes
met
nekhludoffs
with
a
look
as
if
she
were
asking
is
this
that
i
am
doing
right
yes
dear
yes
it
is
right
everything
is
right
everything
is
beautiful
i
love
they
came
down
the
steps
of
the
porch
and
he
came
up
to
them
he
did
not
mean
to
give
them
the
easter
kiss
but
only
to
be
nearer
to
her
matrona
pavlovna
bowed
her
head
and
said
with
a
smile
christ
is
risen
and
her
tone
implied
today
we
are
all
equal
she
wiped
her
mouth
with
her
handkerchief
rolled
into
a
ball
and
stretched
her
lips
towards
him
he
is
indeed
answered
nekhludoff
kissing
her
then
he
looked
at
katusha
she
blushed
and
drew
nearer
christ
is
risen
dmitri
ivanovitch
he
is
risen
indeed
answered
nekhludoff
and
they
kissed
twice
then
paused
as
if
considering
whether
a
third
kiss
were
necessary
and
having
decided
that
it
was
kissed
a
third
time
and
smiled
you
are
going
to
the
priests
asked
nekhludoff
no
we
shall
sit
out
here
a
bit
dmitri
ivanovitch
said
katusha
with
effort
as
if
she
had
accomplished
some
joyous
task
and
her
whole
chest
heaving
with
a
deep
sigh
she
looked
straight
in
his
face
with
a
look
of
devotion
virgin
purity
and
love
in
her
very
slightly
squinting
eyes
in
the
love
between
a
man
and
a
woman
there
always
comes
a
moment
when
this
love
has
reached
its
zenitha
moment
when
it
is
unconscious
unreasoning
and
with
nothing
sensual
about
it
such
a
moment
had
come
for
nekhludoff
on
that
easter
eve
when
he
brought
katusha
back
to
his
mind
now
this
moment
veiled
all
else
the
smooth
glossy
black
head
the
white
tucked
dress
closely
fitting
her
graceful
maidenly
form
her
as
yet
undeveloped
bosom
the
blushing
cheeks
the
tender
shining
black
eyes
with
their
slight
squint
heightened
by
the
sleepless
night
and
her
whole
being
stamped
with
those
two
marked
features
purity
and
chaste
love
love
not
only
for
him
he
knew
that
but
for
everybody
and
everything
not
for
the
good
alone
but
for
all
that
is
in
the
world
even
for
that
beggar
whom
she
had
kissed
he
knew
she
had
that
love
in
her
because
on
that
night
and
morning
he
was
conscious
of
it
in
himself
and
conscious
that
in
this
love
he
became
one
with
her
ah
if
it
had
all
stopped
there
at
the
point
it
had
reached
that
night
yes
all
that
horrible
business
had
not
yet
happened
on
that
easter
eve
he
thought
as
he
sat
by
the
window
of
the
jurymens
room
chapter
xvi
the
first
step
when
he
returned
from
church
nekhludoff
broke
the
fast
with
his
aunts
and
took
a
glass
of
spirits
and
some
wine
having
got
into
that
habit
while
with
his
regiment
and
when
he
reached
his
room
fell
asleep
at
once
dressed
as
he
was
he
was
awakened
by
a
knock
at
the
door
he
knew
it
was
her
knock
and
got
up
rubbing
his
eyes
and
stretching
himself
katusha
is
it
you
come
in
said
he
she
opened
the
door
dinner
is
ready
she
said
she
still
had
on
the
same
white
dress
but
not
the
bow
in
her
hair
she
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
as
if
she
had
communicated
some
very
good
news
to
him
i
am
coming
he
answered
as
he
rose
taking
his
comb
to
arrange
his
hair
she
stood
still
for
a
minute
and
he
noticing
it
threw
down
his
comb
and
made
a
step
towards
her
but
at
that
very
moment
she
turned
suddenly
and
went
with
quick
light
steps
along
the
strip
of
carpet
in
the
middle
of
the
passage
dear
me
what
a
fool
i
am
thought
nekhludoff
why
did
i
not
stop
her
what
he
wanted
her
for
he
did
not
know
himself
but
he
felt
that
when
she
came
into
his
room
something
should
have
been
done
something
that
is
generally
done
on
such
occasions
and
that
he
had
left
it
undone
katusha
wait
he
said
what
do
you
want
she
said
stopping
nothing
only
and
with
an
effort
remembering
how
men
in
his
position
generally
behave
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
she
stood
still
and
looked
into
his
eyes
dont
dmitri
ivanovitch
you
must
not
she
said
blushing
to
tears
and
pushing
away
his
arm
with
her
strong
hard
hand
nekhludoff
let
her
go
and
for
a
moment
he
felt
not
only
confused
and
ashamed
but
disgusted
with
himself
he
should
now
have
believed
himself
and
then
he
would
have
known
that
this
confusion
and
shame
were
caused
by
the
best
feelings
of
his
soul
demanding
to
be
set
free
but
he
thought
it
was
only
his
stupidity
and
that
he
ought
to
behave
as
every
one
else
did
he
caught
her
up
and
kissed
her
on
the
neck
this
kiss
was
very
different
from
that
first
thoughtless
kiss
behind
the
lilac
bush
and
very
different
to
the
kiss
this
morning
in
the
churchyard
this
was
a
dreadful
kiss
and
she
felt
it
oh
what
are
you
doing
she
cried
in
a
tone
as
if
he
had
irreparably
broken
something
of
priceless
value
and
ran
quickly
away
he
came
into
the
diningroom
his
aunts
elegantly
dressed
their
family
doctor
and
a
neighbour
were
already
there
everything
seemed
so
very
ordinary
but
in
nekhludoff
a
storm
was
raging
he
understood
nothing
of
what
was
being
said
and
gave
wrong
answers
thinking
only
of
katusha
the
sound
of
her
steps
in
the
passage
brought
back
the
thrill
of
that
last
kiss
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
when
she
came
into
the
room
he
without
looking
round
felt
her
presence
with
his
whole
being
and
had
to
force
himself
not
to
look
at
her
after
dinner
he
at
once
went
into
his
bedroom
and
for
a
long
time
walked
up
and
down
in
great
excitement
listening
to
every
sound
in
the
house
and
expecting
to
hear
her
steps
the
animal
man
inside
him
had
now
not
only
lifted
its
head
but
had
succeeded
in
trampling
under
foot
the
spiritual
man
of
the
days
of
his
first
visit
and
even
of
that
every
morning
that
dreadful
animal
man
alone
now
ruled
over
him
though
he
was
watching
for
her
all
day
he
could
not
manage
to
meet
her
alone
she
was
probably
trying
to
evade
him
in
the
evening
however
she
was
obliged
to
go
into
the
room
next
to
his
the
doctor
had
been
asked
to
stay
the
night
and
she
had
to
make
his
bed
when
he
heard
her
go
in
nekhludoff
followed
her
treading
softly
and
holding
his
breath
as
if
he
were
going
to
commit
a
crime
she
was
putting
a
clean
pillowcase
on
the
pillow
holding
it
by
two
of
its
corners
with
her
arms
inside
the
pillowcase
she
turned
round
and
smiled
not
a
happy
joyful
smile
as
before
but
in
a
frightened
piteous
way
the
smile
seemed
to
tell
him
that
what
he
was
doing
was
wrong
he
stopped
for
a
moment
there
was
still
the
possibility
of
a
struggle
the
voice
of
his
real
love
for
her
though
feebly
was
still
speaking
of
her
her
feelings
her
life
another
voice
was
saying
take
care
i
dont
let
the
opportunity
for
your
own
happiness
your
own
enjoyment
slip
by
and
this
second
voice
completely
stifled
the
first
he
went
up
to
her
with
determination
and
a
terrible
ungovernable
animal
passion
took
possession
of
him
with
his
arm
round
he
made
her
sit
down
on
the
bed
and
feeling
that
there
was
something
more
to
be
done
he
sat
down
beside
her
dmitri
ivanovitch
dear
please
let
me
go
she
said
with
a
piteous
voice
matrona
pavlovna
is
coming
she
cried
tearing
herself
away
some
one
was
really
coming
to
the
door
well
then
ill
come
to
you
in
the
night
he
whispered
youll
be
alone
what
are
you
thinking
of
on
no
account
no
no
she
said
but
only
with
her
lips
the
tremulous
confusion
of
her
whole
being
said
something
very
different
it
was
matrona
pavlovna
who
had
come
to
the
door
she
came
in
with
a
blanket
over
her
arm
looked
reproachfully
at
nekhludoff
and
began
scolding
katusha
for
having
taken
the
wrong
blanket
nekhludoff
went
out
in
silence
but
he
did
not
even
feel
ashamed
he
could
see
by
matrona
pavlovnas
face
that
she
was
blaming
him
he
knew
that
she
was
blaming
him
with
reason
and
felt
that
he
was
doing
wrong
but
this
novel
low
animal
excitement
having
freed
itself
of
all
the
old
feelings
of
real
love
for
katusha
ruled
supreme
leaving
room
for
nothing
else
he
went
about
as
if
demented
all
the
evening
now
into
his
aunts
then
back
into
his
own
room
then
out
into
the
porch
thinking
all
the
time
how
he
could
meet
her
alone
but
she
avoided
him
and
matrona
pavlovna
watched
her
closely
chapter
xvii
nekhludoff
and
katusha
and
so
the
evening
passed
and
night
came
the
doctor
went
to
bed
nekhludoffs
aunts
had
also
retired
and
he
knew
that
matrona
pavlovna
was
now
with
them
in
their
bedroom
so
that
katusha
was
sure
to
be
alone
in
the
maids
sittingroom
he
again
went
out
into
the
porch
it
was
dark
damp
and
warm
out
of
doors
and
that
white
spring
mist
which
drives
away
the
last
snow
or
is
diffused
by
the
thawing
of
the
last
snow
filled
the
air
from
the
river
under
the
hill
about
a
hundred
steps
from
the
front
door
came
a
strange
sound
it
was
the
ice
breaking
nekhludoff
came
down
the
steps
and
went
up
to
the
window
of
the
maids
room
stepping
over
the
puddles
on
the
bits
of
glazed
snow
his
heart
was
beating
so
fiercely
in
his
breast
that
he
seemed
to
hear
it
his
laboured
breath
came
and
went
in
a
burst
of
longdrawn
sighs
in
the
maids
room
a
small
lamp
was
burning
and
katusha
sat
alone
by
the
table
looking
thoughtfully
in
front
of
her
nekhludoff
stood
a
long
time
without
moving
and
waited
to
see
what
she
not
knowing
that
she
was
observed
would
do
for
a
minute
or
two
she
did
not
move
then
she
lifted
her
eyes
smiled
and
shook
her
head
as
if
chiding
herself
then
changed
her
pose
and
dropped
both
her
arms
on
the
table
and
again
began
gazing
down
in
front
of
her
he
stood
and
looked
at
her
involuntarily
listening
to
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
and
the
strange
sounds
from
the
river
there
on
the
river
beneath
the
white
mist
the
unceasing
labour
went
on
and
sounds
as
of
something
sobbing
cracking
dropping
being
shattered
to
pieces
mixed
with
the
tinkling
of
the
thin
bits
of
ice
as
they
broke
against
each
other
like
glass
there
he
stood
looking
at
katushas
serious
suffering
face
which
betrayed
the
inner
struggle
of
her
soul
and
he
felt
pity
for
her
but
strange
though
it
may
seem
this
pity
only
confirmed
him
in
his
evil
intention
he
knocked
at
the
window
she
started
as
if
she
had
received
an
electric
shock
her
whole
body
trembled
and
a
look
of
horror
came
into
her
face
then
she
jumped
up
approached
the
window
and
brought
her
face
up
to
the
pane
the
look
of
terror
did
not
leave
her
face
even
when
holding
her
hands
up
to
her
eyes
like
blinkers
and
peering
through
the
glass
she
recognised
him
her
face
was
unusually
grave
he
had
never
seen
it
so
before
she
returned
his
smile
but
only
in
submission
to
him
there
was
no
smile
in
her
soul
only
fear
he
beckoned
her
with
his
hand
to
come
out
into
the
yard
to
him
but
she
shook
her
head
and
remained
by
the
window
he
brought
his
face
close
to
the
pane
and
was
going
to
call
out
to
her
but
at
that
moment
she
turned
to
the
door
evidently
some
one
inside
had
called
her
nekhludoff
moved
away
from
the
window
the
fog
was
so
dense
that
five
steps
from
the
house
the
windows
could
not
be
seen
but
the
light
from
the
lamp
shone
red
and
huge
out
of
a
shapeless
black
mass
and
on
the
river
the
same
strange
sounds
went
on
sobbing
and
rustling
and
cracking
and
tinkling
somewhere
in
the
fog
not
far
off
a
cock
crowed
another
answered
and
then
others
far
in
the
village
took
up
the
cry
till
the
sound
of
the
crowing
blended
into
one
while
all
around
was
silent
excepting
the
river
it
was
the
second
time
the
cocks
crowed
that
night
nekhludoff
walked
up
and
down
behind
the
corner
of
the
house
and
once
or
twice
got
into
a
puddle
then
again
came
up
to
the
window
the
lamp
was
still
burning
and
she
was
again
sitting
alone
by
the
table
as
if
uncertain
what
to
do
he
had
hardly
approached
the
window
when
she
looked
up
he
knocked
without
looking
who
it
was
she
at
once
ran
out
of
the
room
and
he
heard
the
outside
door
open
with
a
snap
he
waited
for
her
near
the
side
porch
and
put
his
arms
round
her
without
saying
a
word
she
clung
to
him
put
up
her
face
and
met
his
kiss
with
her
lips
then
the
door
again
gave
the
same
sort
of
snap
and
opened
and
the
voice
of
matrona
pavlovna
called
out
angrily
katusha
she
tore
herself
away
from
him
and
returned
into
the
maids
room
he
heard
the
latch
click
and
then
all
was
quiet
the
red
light
disappeared
and
only
the
mist
remained
and
the
bustle
on
the
river
went
on
nekhludoff
went
up
to
the
window
nobody
was
to
be
seen
he
knocked
but
got
no
answer
he
went
back
into
the
house
by
the
front
door
but
could
not
sleep
he
got
up
and
went
with
bare
feet
along
the
passage
to
her
door
next
to
matrona
pavlovnas
room
he
heard
matrona
pavlovna
snoring
quietly
and
was
about
to
go
on
when
she
coughed
and
turned
on
her
creaking
bed
and
his
heart
fell
and
he
stood
immovable
for
about
five
minutes
when
all
was
quiet
and
she
began
to
snore
peacefully
again
he
went
on
trying
to
step
on
the
boards
that
did
not
creak
and
came
to
katushas
door
there
was
no
sound
to
be
heard
she
was
probably
awake
or
else
he
would
have
heard
her
breathing
but
as
soon
as
he
had
whispered
katusha
she
jumped
up
and
began
to
persuade
him
as
if
angrily
to
go
away
open
let
me
in
just
for
a
moment
i
implore
you
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
saying







when
she
left
him
trembling
and
silent
giving
no
answer
to
his
words
he
again
went
out
into
the
porch
and
stood
trying
to
understand
the
meaning
of
what
had
happened
it
was
getting
lighter
from
the
river
below
the
creaking
and
tinkling
and
sobbing
of
the
breaking
ice
came
still
louder
and
a
gurgling
sound
could
now
also
be
heard
the
mist
had
begun
to
sink
and
from
above
it
the
waning
moon
dimly
lighted
up
something
black
and
weird
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
all
was
it
a
great
joy
or
a
great
misfortune
that
had
befallen
him
he
asked
himself
chapter
xviii
afterwards
the
next
day
the
gay
handsome
and
brilliant
schonbock
joined
nekhludoff
at
his
aunts
house
and
quite
won
their
hearts
by
his
refined
and
amiable
manner
his
high
spirits
his
generosity
and
his
affection
for
dmitri
but
though
the
old
ladies
admired
his
generosity
it
rather
perplexed
them
for
it
seemed
exaggerated
he
gave
a
rouble
to
some
blind
beggars
who
came
to
the
gate
gave
15
roubles
in
tips
to
the
servants
and
when
sophia
ivanovnas
pet
dog
hurt
his
paw
and
it
bled
he
tore
his
hemstitched
cambric
handkerchief
into
strips
sophia
ivanovna
knew
that
such
handkerchiefs
cost
at
least
15
roubles
a
dozen
and
bandaged
the
dogs
foot
the
old
ladies
had
never
met
people
of
this
kind
and
did
not
know
that
schonbock
owed
200000
roubles
which
he
was
never
going
to
pay
and
that
therefore
25
roubles
more
or
less
did
not
matter
a
bit
to
him
schonbock
stayed
only
one
day
and
he
and
nekhludoff
both
left
at
night
they
could
not
stay
away
from
their
regiment
any
longer
for
their
leave
was
fully
up
at
the
stage
which
nekhludoffs
selfish
mania
had
now
reached
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
himself
he
was
wondering
whether
his
conduct
if
found
out
would
be
blamed
much
or
at
all
but
he
did
not
consider
what
katusha
was
now
going
through
and
what
was
going
to
happen
to
her
he
saw
that
schonbock
guessed
his
relations
to
her
and
this
flattered
his
vanity
ah
i
see
how
it
is
you
have
taken
such
a
sudden
fancy
to
your
aunts
that
you
have
been
living
nearly
a
week
with
them
schonbock
remarked
when
he
had
seen
katusha
well
i
dont
wondershould
have
done
the
same
shes
charming
nekhludoff
was
also
thinking
that
though
it
was
a
pity
to
go
away
before
having
fully
gratified
the
cravings
of
his
love
for
her
yet
the
absolute
necessity
of
parting
had
its
advantages
because
it
put
a
sudden
stop
to
relations
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
for
him
to
continue
then
he
thought
that
he
ought
to
give
her
some
money
not
for
her
not
because
she
might
need
it
but
because
it
was
the
thing
to
do
so
he
gave
her
what
seemed
to
him
a
liberal
amount
considering
his
and
her
station
on
the
day
of
his
departure
after
dinner
he
went
out
and
waited
for
her
at
the
side
entrance
she
flushed
up
when
she
saw
him
and
wished
to
pass
by
directing
his
attention
to
the
open
door
of
the
maids
room
by
a
look
but
he
stopped
her
i
have
come
to
say
goodbye
he
said
crumbling
in
his
hand
an
envelope
with
a
100rouble
note
inside
there
i




she
guessed
what
he
meant
knit
her
brows
and
shaking
her
head
pushed
his
hand
away
take
it
oh
you
must
he
stammered
and
thrust
the
envelope
into
the
bib
of
her
apron
and
ran
back
to
his
room
groaning
and
frowning
as
if
he
had
hurt
himself
and
for
a
long
time
he
went
up
and
down
writhing
as
in
pain
and
even
stamping
and
groaning
aloud
as
he
thought
of
this
last
scene
but
what
else
could
i
have
done
is
it
not
what
happens
to
every
one
and
if
every
one
does
the
same



well
i
suppose
it
cant
be
helped
in
this
way
he
tried
to
get
peace
of
mind
but
in
vain
the
recollection
of
what
had
passed
burned
his
conscience
in
his
soulin
the
very
depths
of
his
soulhe
knew
that
he
had
acted
in
a
base
cruel
cowardly
manner
and
that
the
knowledge
of
this
act
of
his
must
prevent
him
not
only
from
finding
fault
with
any
one
else
but
even
from
looking
straight
into
other
peoples
eyes
not
to
mention
the
impossibility
of
considering
himself
a
splendid
noble
highminded
fellow
as
he
did
and
had
to
do
to
go
on
living
his
life
boldly
and
merrily
there
was
only
one
solution
of
the
problemie
not
to
think
about
it
he
succeeded
in
doing
so
the
life
he
was
now
entering
upon
the
new
surroundings
new
friends
the
war
all
helped
him
to
forget
and
the
longer
he
lived
the
less
he
thought
about
it
until
at
last
he
forgot
it
completely
once
only
when
after
the
war
he
went
to
see
his
aunts
in
hopes
of
meeting
katusha
and
heard
that
soon
after
his
last
visit
she
had
left
and
that
his
aunts
had
heard
she
had
been
confined
somewhere
or
other
and
had
gone
quite
to
the
bad
his
heart
ached
according
to
the
time
of
her
confinement
the
child
might
or
might
not
have
been
his
his
aunts
said
she
had
gone
wrong
that
she
had
inherited
her
mothers
depraved
nature
and
he
was
pleased
to
hear
this
opinion
of
his
aunts
it
seemed
to
acquit
him
at
first
he
thought
of
trying
to
find
her
and
her
child
but
then
just
because
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
felt
so
ashamed
and
pained
when
thinking
about
her
he
did
not
make
the
necessary
effort
to
find
her
but
tried
to
forget
his
sin
again
and
ceased
to
think
about
it
and
now
this
strange
coincidence
brought
it
all
back
to
his
memory
and
demanded
from
him
the
acknowledgment
of
the
heartless
cruel
cowardice
which
had
made
it
possible
for
him
to
live
these
nine
years
with
such
a
sin
on
his
conscience
but
he
was
still
far
from
such
an
acknowledgment
and
his
only
fear
was
that
everything
might
now
be
found
out
and
that
she
or
her
advocate
might
recount
it
all
and
put
him
to
shame

nekhludoff
left
the
court
and
went
into
the
jurymens
room
he
sat
by
the
window
smoking
all
the
while
and
hearing
what
was
being
said
around
him
the
merry
merchant
seemed
with
all
his
heart
to
sympathise
with

of
spending

the

was
stating
his
conviction
that
in
some
way

other

were
the

peter

was
joking
about
something
with
the
jewish
clerk
and
they
burst
out
laughing
nekhludoff
answered
all
the
questions
addressed
to
him
in
monosyllables
and
longed
only
to
be
left
in
peace
when
the
usher
with
his
sideways
gait
called
the
jury
back
to
the
court
nekhludoff
was
seized
with
fear
as
if
he
were
not
going
to
judge
but
to
be
judged
in
the
depth
of
his
soul
he
felt
that
he
was
a
scoundrel
who
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
look
people
in
the
face
yet
by
sheer
force
of
habit
he
stepped
on
to
the
platform
in
his
usual
selfpossessed
manner
and
sat
down
crossing
his
legs
and
playing
with
his
pincenez
the
prisoners
had
also
been
led
out
and
were
now
brought
in
again
there
were
some
new
faces
in
the
court
witnesses
and
nekhludoff
noticed
that
maslova
could
not
take
her
eyes
off
a
very
fat
woman
who
sat
in
the
row
in
front
of
the
grating
very
showily
dressed
in
silk
and

an
elegant
little
reticule
on
her

was

was
as
he
subsequently
found
out
one
of

witnesses

which

had
belonged

then
after
some
consultation
as
to
whether
the
witnesses
were
to
be
sworn
in
or
not
the
old
priest
came
in
again
dragging
his
legs
with
difficulty
and
again
arranging
the
golden
cross
on
his
breast
swore
the
witnesses
and
the
expert
in
the
same
quiet
manner
and
with
the
same
assurance
that
he
was
doing
something
useful
and
important
the
witnesses
having
been
sworn
all
but
kitaeva
the
keeper
of
the
house
were
led
out
again
she
was
asked
what
she
knew
about
this
affair
kitaeva
nodded
her
head
and
the
big
hat
at
every
sentence
and
smiled
affectedly
she
gave
a
very
full
and
intelligent
account
speaking
with
a
strong
german
accent
first
of
all
the
hotel
servant
simeon
whom
she
knew
came
to
her
establishment
on
behalf
of
a
rich
siberian
merchant
and
she
sent
lubov
back

him
after
a

she
looked
at
the
prisoner
as
she
said
this
nekhludoff
thought
he
saw
maslova
smile
here
and
this
seemed
disgusting
to
him
a
strange
indefinite
feeling
of
loathing
mingled
with
suffering
arose
in
him
and
what
was
your
opinion
of

asked

looked
at
the

then
suddenly
turned
her
eyes
on
the
jury
and
fixed
them
on
nekhludoff
and
her
face
grew
serious
and
even
severe
one
of
her
serious
eyes
squinted
and
those
two
strange
eyes
for
some
time
gazed
at
nekhludoff
who
in
spite
of
the
terrors
that
seized
him
could
not
take
his
look
off
these
squinting
eyes
with
their
bright
clear
whites
he
thought
of
that
dreadful
night
with
its
mist
the
ice
breaking
on
the
river
below
and
when
the
waning
moon
with
horns
turned
upwards
that
had
risen
towards
morning
lit
up
something
black
and
weird
these
two
black
eyes
now
looking
at
him
reminded
him
of
this
weird
black
something
she
has
recognised
me
he
thought
and
nekhludoff
shrank
as
if
expecting
a
blow
but
she
had
not
recognised
him
she
sighed
quietly
and
again
looked
at
the
president
nekhludoff
also
sighed
oh
if
it
would
only
get
on
quicker
he
thought
he
now
felt
the
same
loathing
and
pity
and
vexation
as
when
out
shooting
he
was
obliged
to
kill
a
wounded
bird
the
wounded
bird
struggles
in
the
game
bag
one
is
disgusted
and
yet
feels
pity
and
one
is
in
a
hurry
to
kill
the
bird
and
forget
it
such
mixed
feelings
filled
nekhludoffs
breast
as
he
sat
listening
to
the
examination
of
the
witnesses
chapter
xx
the
trialthe
medical
report
but
as
if
to
spite
him
the
case
dragged
out
to
a
great
length
after
each
witness
had
been
examined
separately
and
the
expert
last
of
all
and
a
great
number
of
useless
questions
had
been
put
with
the
usual
air
of
importance
by
the
public
prosecutor
and
by
both
advocates
the
president
invited
the
jury
to
examine
the
objects
offered
as
material
evidence
they
consisted
of
an
enormous
diamond
ring
which
had
evidently
been
worn
on
the
first
finger
and
a
test
tube
in
which
the
poison
had
been
analysed
these
things
had
seals
and
labels
attached
to
them
just
as
the
witnesses
were
about
to
look
at
these
things
the
public
prosecutor
rose
and
demanded
that
before
they
did
this
the
results
of
the
doctors
examination
of
the
body
should
be
read
the
president
who
was
hurrying
the
business
through
as
fast
as
he
could
in
order
to
visit
his
swiss
friend
though
he
knew
that
the
reading
of
this
paper
could
have
no
other
effect
than
that
of
producing
weariness
and
putting
off
the
dinner
hour
and
that
the
public
prosecutor
wanted
it
read
simply
because
he
knew
he
had
a
right
to
demand
it
had
no
option
but
to
express
his
consent
the
secretary
got
out
the
doctors
report
and
again
began
to
read
in
his
weary
lisping
voice
making
no
distinction
between
the
rs
and
ls
the
external
examination
proved
that
1
theropont
smelkoffs
height
was
six
feet
five
inches
not
so
bad
that
a
very
good
size
whispered
the
merchant
with
interest
into
nekhludoffs
ear
2
he
looked
about
40
years
of
age
3
the
body
was
of
a
swollen
appearance
4
the
flesh
was
of
a
greenish
colour
with
dark
spots
in
several
places
5
the
skin
was
raised
in
blisters
of
different
sizes
and
in
places
had
come
off
in
large
pieces
6
the
hair
was
chestnut
it
was
thick
and
separated
easily
from
the
skin
when
touched
7
the
eyeballs
protruded
from
their
sockets
and
the
cornea
had
grown
dim
8
out
of
the
nostrils
both
ears
and
the
mouth
oozed
serous
liquid
the
mouth
was
half
open
9
the
neck
had
almost
disappeared
owing
to
the
swelling
of
the
face
and
chest
and
so
on
and
so
on
four
pages
were
covered
with
the
27
paragraphs
describing
all
the
details
of
the
external
examination
of
the
enormous
fat
swollen
and
decomposing
body
of
the
merchant
who
had
been
making
merry
in
the
town
the
indefinite
loathing
that
nekhludoff
felt
was
increased
by
the
description
of
the
corpse
katushas
life
and
the
scrum
oozing
from
the
nostrils
of
the
corpse
and
the
eyes
that
protruded
out
of
their
sockets
and
his
own
treatment
of
herall
seemed
to
belong
to
the
same
order
of
things
and
he
felt
surrounded
and
wholly
absorbed
by
things
of
the
same
nature
when
the
reading
of
the
report
of
the
external
examination
was
ended
the
president
heaved
a
sigh
and
raised
his
hand
hoping
it
was
finished
but
the
secretary
at
once
went
on
to
the
description
of
the
internal
examination
the
presidents
head
again
dropped
into
his
hand
and
he
shut
his
eyes
the
merchant
next
to
nekhludoff
could
hardly
keep
awake
and
now
and
then
his
body
swayed
to
and
fro
the
prisoners
and
the
gendarmes
sat
perfectly
quiet
the
internal
examination
showed
that
1
the
skin
was
easily
detachable
from
the
bones
of
the
skull
and
there
was
no
coagulated
blood
2
the
bones
of
the
skull
were
of
average
thickness
and
in
sound
condition
3
on
the
membrane
of
the
brain
there
were
two
discoloured
spots
about
four
inches
long
the
membrane
itself
being
of
a
dull
white
and
so
on
for
13
paragraphs
more
then
followed
the
names
and
signatures
of
the
assistants
and
the
doctors
conclusion
showing
that
the
changes
observed
in
the
stomach
and
to
a
lesser
degree
in
the
bowels
and
kidneys
at
the
postmortem
examination
and
described
in
the
official
report
gave
great
probability
to
the
conclusion
that
smelkoffs
death
was
caused
by
poison
which
had
entered
his
stomach
mixed
with
alcohol
to
decide
from
the
state
of
the
stomach
what
poison
had
been
introduced
was
difficult
but
it
was
necessary
to
suppose
that
the
poison
entered
the
stomach
mixed
with
alcohol
since
a
great
quantity
of
the
latter
was
found
in
smelkoffs
stomach
he
could
drink
and
no
mistake
again
whispered
the
merchant
who
had
just
waked
up
the
reading
of
this
report
had
taken
a
full
hour
but
it
had
not
satisfied
the
public
prosecutor
for
when
it
had
been
read
through
and
the
president
turned
to
him
saying
i
suppose
it
is
superfluous
to
read
the
report
of
the
examination
of
the
internal
organs
he
answered
in
a
severe
tone
without
looking
at
the
president
i
shall
ask
to
have
it
read
he
raised
himself
a
little
and
showed
by
his
manner
that
he
had
a
right
to
have
this
report
read
and
would
claim
this
right
and
that
if
that
were
not
granted
it
would
serve
as
a
cause
of
appeal
the
member
of
the
court
with
the
big
beard
who
suffered
from
catarrh
of
the
stomach
feeling
quite
done
up
turned
to
the
president
what
is
the
use
of
reading
all
this
it
is
only
dragging
it
out
these
new
brooms
do
not
sweep
clean
they
only
take
a
long
while
doing
it
the
member
with
the
gold
spectacles
said
nothing
but
only
looked
gloomily
in
front
of
him
expecting
nothing
good
either
from
his
wife
or
life
in
general
the
reading
of

report

the
secretary
began
again
with
firmness
and
raising
the
pitch
of
his
voice
as
if
to
dispel
the
sleepiness
that
had
overtaken
all
present
in
the
presence
of
the
assistant

the

here
whispered
to
one
of
the
members
then
stooped
to
the
other
and
having
received
their
consent
he
said
the
court
considers
the
reading
of
this
report
superfluous
the
secretary
stopped
reading
and
folded
the
paper
and
the
public
prosecutor
angrily
began
to
write
down
something
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
may
now
examine
the
articles
of
material
evidence
said
the
president
the
foreman
and
several
of
the
others
rose
and
went
to
the
table
not
quite
knowing
what
to
do
with
their
hands
they
looked
in
turn
at
the
glass
the
test
tube
and
the
ring
the
merchant
even
tried
on
the
ring
ah
that
was
a
finger
he
said
returning
to
his
place
like
a
cucumber
he
added
evidently
the
image
he
had
formed
in
his
mind
of
the
gigantic
merchant
amused
him
chapter

the
trialthe
prosecutor
and
the
advocates
when
the
examination
of
the
articles
of
material
evidence
was
finished
the
president
announced
that
the
investigation
was
now
concluded
and
immediately
called
on
the
prosecutor
to
proceed
hoping
that
as
the
latter
was
also
a
man
he
too
might
feel
inclined
to
smoke
or
dine
and
show
some
mercy
on
the
rest
but
the
public
prosecutor
showed
mercy
neither
to
himself
nor
to
any
one
else
he
was
very
stupid
by
nature
but
besides
this
he
had
had
the
misfortune
of
finishing
school
with
a
gold
medal
and
of
receiving
a
reward
for
his
essay
on
servitude
when
studying
roman
law
at
the
university
and
was
therefore
selfconfident
and
selfsatisfied
in
the
highest
degree
his
success
with
the
ladies
also
conducing
to
this
and
his
stupidity
had
become
extraordinary
when
the
word
was
given
to
him
he
got
up
slowly
showing
the
whole
of
his
graceful
figure
in
his
embroidered
uniform
putting
his
hand
on
the
desk
he
looked
round
the
room
slightly
bowing
his
head
and
avoiding
the
eyes
of
the
prisoners
began
to
read
the
speech
he
had
prepared
while
the
reports
were
being
read

of
the
jury
the
business
that
now
lies
before
you
is
if
i
may
so
express
myself
very
characteristic
the
speech
of
a
public
prosecutor
according
to
his
views
should
always
have
a
social
importance
like
the
celebrated
speeches
made
by
the
advocates

but
this
did
not
matter
the
celebrities
had
begun
in
the
same
way
to
be
always
at
the
height
of
his
position
ie
to
penetrate
into
the
depths
of
the
psychological
significance
of
crime
and
to
discover
the
wounds
of
society
was
one
of
the
prosecutors
principles
you
see
before
you
gentlemen
of
the
jury
a
crime
characteristic
if
i
may
so
express
myself
of
the
end
of
our
century
bearing
so
to
say
the
specific
features
of
that
very
painful
phenomenon
the
corruption
to
which
those
elements
of
our
presentday
society
which
are
so
to
say
particularly
exposed
to
the
burning
rays
of
this
process
are
subject
the
public
prosecutor
spoke
at
great
length
trying
not
to
forget
any
of
the
notions
he
had
formed
in
his
mind
and
on
the
other
hand
never
to
hesitate
and
let
his
speech
flow
on
for
an
hour
and
a
quarter
without
a
break
only
once
he
stopped
and
for
some
time
stood
swallowing
his
saliva
but
he
soon
mastered
himself
and
made
up
for
the
interruption
by
heightened
eloquence
he
spoke
now
with
a
tender
insinuating
accent
stepping
from
foot
to
foot
and
looking
at
the
jury
now
in
quiet
businesslike
tones
glancing
into
his
notebook
then
with
a
loud
accusing
voice
looking
from
the
audience
to
the
advocates
but
he
avoided
looking
at
the
prisoners
who
were
all
three
fixedly
gazing
at
him
every
new
craze
then
in
vogue
among
his
set
was
alluded
to
in
his
speech
everything
that
then
was
and
some
things
that
still
are
considered
to
be
the
last
words

according
to
his
definition
the
merchant
smelkoff
was
of
the
genuine
russian
type
and
had
perished
in
consequence
of
his
generous
trusting
nature
having
fallen
into
the
hands
of
deeply
degraded
individuals
simeon
kartinkin
was
the
atavistic
production
of
serfdom
a
stupefied
ignorant
unprincipled
man
who
had
not
even
any
religion
euphemia
was
his
mistress
and
a
victim
of
heredity
all
the
signs
of
degeneration
were
noticeable
in
her
the
chief
wirepuller
in
this
affair
was
maslova
presenting
the
phenomenon
of
decadence
in
its
lowest
form
this
woman
he
said
looking
at
her
has
as
we
have
today
heard
from
her
mistress
in
this
court
received
an
education
she
cannot
only
read
and
write
but
she
knows
french
she
is
illegitimate
and
probably
carries
in
her
the
germs
of
criminality
she
was
educated
in
an
enlightened
noble
family
and
might
have
lived
by
honest
work
but
she
deserts
her
benefactress
gives
herself
up
to
a
life
of
shame
in
which
she
is
distinguished
from
her
companions
by
her
education
and
chiefly
gentlemen
of
the
jury
as
you
have
heard
from
her
mistress
by
her
power
of
acting
on
the
visitors
by
means
of
that
mysterious
capacity
lately
investigated
by
science
especially
by
the
school
of
charcot
known
by
the
name
of
hypnotic
influence

these
means
she

pitilessly
to

he
is
piling
it
on

said
the
president
with
a
smile
bending
towards
the
serious
member
a
fearful
blockhead
said
the
serious

speech

awaits
society
from
those
whom
i
may
perhaps
be
permitted
to
call
pathological
individuals
such
as
maslova
guard

from
infection
guard
the
innocent
and
strong
elements
of
society
from
contagion
or
even
destruction
and
as
if
himself
overcome
by
the
significance
of
the
expected
verdict
the
public
prosecutor
sank
into
his
chair
highly
delighted
with
his
speech
the
sense
of
the
speech
when
divested
of
all
its
flowers
of
rhetoric
was
that
maslova
having
gained
the
merchants
confidence
hypnotised
him
and
went
to
his
lodgings
with
his
key
meaning
to
take
all
the
money
herself
but
having
been
caught
in
the
act
by
simeon
and
euphemia
had
to
share
it
with
them
then
in
order
to
hide
the
traces
of
the
crime
she
had
returned
to
the
lodgings
with
the
merchant
and
there
poisoned
him
after
the
prosecutor
had
spoken
a
middleaged
man
in
swallowtail
coat
and
lowcut
waistcoat
showing
a
large
halfcircle
of
starched
white
shirt
rose
from
the
advocates
bench
and
made
a
speech
in
defence
of
kartinkin
and
botchkova
this
was
an
advocate
engaged
by
them
for
300
roubles
he
acquitted
them
both
and
put
all
the
blame
on
maslova
he
denied
the
truth
of
maslovas
statements
that
botchkova
and
kartinkin
were
with
her
when
she
took
the
money
laying
great
stress
on
the
point
that
her
evidence
could
not
be
accepted
she
being
charged
with
poisoning
the
2500
roubles
the
advocate
said
could
have
been
easily
earned
by
two
honest
people
getting
from
three
to
five
roubles
per
day
in
tips
from
the
lodgers
the
merchants
money
was
stolen
by
maslova
and
given
away
or
even
lost
as
she
was
not
in
a
normal
state
the
poisoning
was
committed
by
maslova
alone
therefore
he
begged
the
jury
to
acquit
kartinkin
and
botchkova
of
stealing
the
money
or
if
they
could
not
acquit
them
of
the
theft
at
least
to
admit
that
it
was
done
without
any
participation
in
the
poisoning
in
conclusion
the
advocate
remarked
with
a
thrust
at
the
public
prosecutor
that
the
brilliant
observations
of
that
gentleman
on
heredity
while
explaining
scientific
facts
concerning
heredity
were
inapplicable
in
this
case
as
botchkova
was
of
unknown
parentage
the
public
prosecutor
put
something
down
on
paper
with
an
angry
look
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
contemptuous
surprise
then
maslovas
advocate
rose
and
timidly
and
hesitatingly
began
his
speech
in
her
defence
without
denying
that
she
had
taken
part
in
the
stealing
of
the
money
he
insisted
on
the
fact
that
she
had
no
intention
of
poisoning
smelkoff
but
had
given
him
the
powder
only
to
make
him
fall
asleep
he
tried
to
go
in
for
a
little
eloquence
in
giving
a
description
of
how
maslova
was
led
into
a
life
of
debauchery
by
a
man
who
had
remained
unpunished
while
she
had
to
bear
all
the
weight
of
her
fall
but
this
excursion
into
the
domain
of
psychology
was
so
unsuccessful
that
it
made
everybody
feel
uncomfortable
when
he
muttered
something
about
mens
cruelty
and
womens
helplessness
the
president
tried
to
help
him
by
asking
him
to
keep
closer
to
the
facts
of
the
case
when
he
had
finished
the
public
prosecutor
got
up
to
reply
he
defended
his
position
against
the
first
advocate
saying
that
even
if
botchkova
was
of
unknown
parentage
the
truth
of
the
doctrine
of
heredity
was
thereby
in
no
way
invalidated
since
the
laws
of
heredity
were
so
far
proved
by
science
that
we
can
not
only
deduce
the
crime
from
heredity
but
heredity
from
the
crime
as
to
the
statement
made
in
defence
of
maslova
that
she
was
the
victim
of
an
imaginary
he
laid
a
particularly
venomous
stress
on
the
word
imaginary
betrayer
he
could
only
say
that
from
the
evidence
before
them
it
was
much
more
likely
that
she
had
played
the
part
of
temptress
to
many
and
many
a
victim
who
had
fallen
into
her
hands
having
said
this

sat

triumph

were
offered
permission
to
speak
in
their
own
defence

botchkova
repeated
once
more
that
she
knew
nothing
about
it
and
had
taken
part
in
nothing
and
firmly
laid
the
whole

maslova
said
nothing
in
her
defence
told
she
might
do
so
by
the
president
she
only
lifted
her
eyes
to
him
cast
a
look
round
the
room
like
a
hunted
animal
and
dropping
her
head
began
to
cry
sobbing
aloud
what
is
the
matter
the
merchant
asked
nekhludoff
hearing
him
utter
a
strange
sound
this
was
the
sound
of
weeping
fiercely
kept
back
nekhludoff
had
not
yet
understood
the
significance
of
his
present
position
and
attributed
the
sobs
he
could
hardly
keep
back
and
the
tears
that
filled
his
eyes
to
the
weakness
of
his
nerves
he
put
on
his
pincenez
in
order
to
hide
the
tears
then
got
out
his
handkerchief
and
began
blowing
his
nose
fear
of
the
disgrace
that
would
befall
him
if
every
one
in
the
court
knew
of
his
conduct
stifled
the
inner
working
of
his
soul
this
fear
was
during
this
first
period
stronger
than
all
else
chapter
xxii
the
trialthe
summing
up
after
the
last
words
of
the
prisoners
had
been
heard
the
form
in
which
the
questions
were
to
be
put
to
the
jury
was
settled
which
also
took
some
time
at
last
the
questions
were
formulated
and
the
president
began
the
summing
up
before
putting
the
case
to
the
jury
he
spoke
to
them
for
some
time
in
a
pleasant
homely
manner
explaining
that
burglary
was
burglary
and
theft
was
theft
and
that
stealing
from
a
place
which
was
under
lock
and
key
was
stealing
from
a
place
under
lock
and
key
while
he
was
explaining
this
he
looked
several
times
at
nekhludoff
as
if
wishing
to
impress
upon
him
these
important
facts
in
hopes
that
having
understood
it
nekhludoff
would
make
his
fellowjurymen
also
understand
it
when
he
considered
that
the
jury
were
sufficiently
imbued
with
these
facts
he
proceeded
to
enunciate
another
truthnamely
that
a
murder
is
an
action
which
has
the
death
of
a
human
being
as
its
consequence
and
that
poisoning
could
therefore
also
be
termed
murder
when
according
to
his
opinion
this
truth
had
also
been
received
by
the
jury
he
went
on
to
explain
that
if
theft
and
murder
had
been
committed
at
the
same
time
the
combination
of
the
crimes
was
theft
with
murder
although
he
was
himself
anxious
to
finish
as
soon
as
possible
although
he
knew
that
his
swiss
friend
would
be
waiting
for
him
he
had
grown
so
used
to
his
occupation
that
having
begun
to
speak
he
could
not
stop
himself
and
therefore
he
went
on
to
impress
on
the
jury
with
much
detail
that
if
they
found
the
prisoners
guilty
they
would
have
the
right
to
give
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
if
they
found
them
not
guilty
to
give
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
and
if
they
found
them
guilty
of
one
of
the
crimes
and
not
of
the
other
they
might
give
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
the
one
count
and
of
not
guilty
on
the
other
then
he
explained
that
though
this
right
was
given
them
they
should
use
it
with
reason
he
was
going
to
add
that
if
they
gave
an
affirmative
answer
to
any
question
that
was
put
to
them
they
would
thereby
affirm
everything
included
in
the
question
so
that
if
they
did
not
wish
to
affirm
the
whole
of
the
question
they
should
mention
the
part
of
the
question
they
wished
to
be
excepted
but
glancing
at
the
clock
and
seeing
it
was
already
five
minutes
to
three
he
resolved
to
trust
to
their
being
intelligent
enough
to
understand
this
without
further
comment
the
facts
of
this
case
are
the
following
began
the
president
and
repeated
all
that
had
already
been
said
several
times
by
the
advocates
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
witnesses
the
president
spoke
and
the
members
on
each
side
of
him
listened
with
deeplyattentive
expressions
but
looked
from
time
to
time
at
the
clock
for
they
considered
the
speech
too
long
though
very
goodie
such
as
it
ought
to
be
the
public
prosecutor
the
lawyers
and
in
fact
everyone
in
the
court
shared
the
same
impression
the
president
finished
the
summing
up
then
he
found
it
necessary
to
tell
the
jury
what
they
all
knew
or
might
have
found
out
by
reading
it
upie
how
they
were
to
consider
the
case
count
the
votes
in
case
of
a
tie
to
acquit
the
prisoners
and
so
on
everything
seemed
to
have
been
told
but
no
the
president
could
not
forego
his
right
of
speaking
as
yet
it
was
so
pleasant
to
hear
the
impressive
tones
of
his
own
voice
and
therefore
he
found
it
necessary
to
say
a
few
words
more
about
the
importance
of
the
rights
given
to
the
jury
how
carefully
they
should
use
the
rights
and
how
they
ought
not
to
abuse
them
about
their
being
on
their
oath
that
they
were
the
conscience
of
society
that
the
secrecy
of
the
debatingroom
should
be
considered
sacred
etc
from
the
time
the
president
commenced
his
speech
maslova
watched
him
without
moving
her
eyes
as
if
afraid
of
losing
a
single
word
so
that
nekhludoff
was
not
afraid
of
meeting
her
eyes
and
kept
looking
at
her
all
the
time
and
his
mind
passed
through
those
phases
in
which
a
face
which
we
have
not
seen
for
many
years
first
strikes
us
with
the
outward
changes
brought
about
during
the
time
of
separation
and
then
gradually
becomes
more
and
more
like
its
old
self
when
the
changes
made
by
time
seem
to
disappear
and
before
our
spiritual
eyes
rises
only
the
principal
expression
of
one
exceptional
unique
individuality
yes
though
dressed
in
a
prison
cloak
and
in
spite
of
the
developed
figure
the
fulness
of
the
bosom
and
lower
part
of
the
face
in
spite
of
a
few
wrinkles
on
the
forehead
and
temples
and
the
swollen
eyes
this
was
certainly
the
same
katusha
who
on
that
easter
eve
had
so
innocently
looked
up
to
him
whom
she
loved
with
her
fond
laughing
eyes
full
of
joy
and
life
what
a
strange
coincidence
that
after
ten
years
during
which
i
never
saw
her
this
case
should
have
come
up
today
when
i
am
on
the
jury
and
that
it
is
in
the
prisoners
dock
that
i
see
her
again
and
how
will
it
end
oh
dear
if
they
would
only
get
on
quicker
still
he
would
not
give
in
to
the
feelings
of
repentance
which
began
to
arise
within
him
he
tried
to
consider
it
all
as
a
coincidence
which
would
pass
without
infringing
his
manner
of
life
he
felt
himself
in
the
position
of
a
puppy
when
its
master
taking
it
by
the
scruff
of
its
neck
rubs
its
nose
in
the
mess
it
has
made
the
puppy
whines
draws
back
and
wants
to
get
away
as
far
as
possible
from
the
effects
of
its
misdeed
but
the
pitiless
master
does
not
let
go
and
so
nekhludoff
feeling
all
the
repulsiveness
of
what
he
had
done
felt
also
the
powerful
hand
of
the
master
but
he
did
not
feel
the
whole
significance
of
his
action
yet
and
would
not
recognise
the
masters
hand
he
did
not
wish
to
believe
that
it
was
the
effect
of
his
deed
that
lay
before
him
but
the
pitiless
hand
of
the
master
held
him
and
he
felt
he
could
not
get
away
he
was
still
keeping
up
his
courage
and
sat
on
his
chair
in
the
first
row
in
his
usual
selfpossessed
pose
one
leg
carelessly
thrown
over
the
other
and
playing
with
his
pincenez
yet
all
the
while
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
felt
the
cruelty
cowardice
and
baseness
not
only
of
this
particular
action
of
his
but
of
his
whole
selfwilled
depraved
cruel
idle
life
and
that
dreadful
veil
which
had
in
some
unaccountable
manner
hidden
from
him
this
sin
of
his
and
the
whole
of
his
subsequent
life
was
beginning
to
shake
and
he
caught
glimpses
of
what
was
covered
by
that
veil

the
trialthe
verdict
at
last
the
president
finished
his
speech
and
lifting
the
list
of
questions
with
a
graceful
movement
of
his
arm
he
handed
it
to
the
foreman
who
came
up
to
take
it
the
jury
glad
to
be
able
to
get
into
the
debatingcourt
got
up
one
after
the
other
and
left
the
room
looking
as
if
a
bit
ashamed
of
themselves
and
again
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
their
hands
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
behind
them
a
gendarme
came
up
to
it
pulled
his
sword
out
of
the
scabbard
and
holding
it
up
against
his
shoulder
stood
at
the
door
the
judges
got
up
and
went
away
the
prisoners
were
also
led
out
when
the
jury
came
into
the
debatingroom
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
take
out
their
cigarettes
as
before
and
begin
smoking
the
sense
of
the
unnaturalness
and
falseness
of
their
position
which
all
of
them
had
experienced
while
sitting
in
their
places
in
the
court
passed
when
they
entered
the
debatingroom
and
started
smoking
and
they
settled
down
with
a
feeling
of
relief
and
at
once
began
an
animated
conversation
tisnt
the
girls
fault
shes
got
mixed
up
in
it
said
the
kindly
merchant
we
must
recommend
her
to
mercy
thats
just
what
we
are
going
to
consider
said
the
foreman
we
must
not
give
way
to
our
personal
impressions
the
presidents
summing
up
was
good
remarked
the
colonel
good
why
it
nearly
sent
me
to
sleep
the
chief
point
is
that
the
servants
could
have
known
nothing
about
the
money
if
maslova
had
not
been
in
accord
with
them
said
the
clerk
of
jewish
extraction
well
do
you
think
that
it
was
she
who
stole
the
money
asked
one
of
the
jury
i
will
never
believe
it
cried
the
kindly
merchant
it
was
all
that
redeyed
hags
doing
they
are
a
nice
lot
all
of
them
said
the
colonel
but
she
says
she
never
went
into
the
room
oh
believe
her
by
all
means
i
should
not
believe
that
jade
not
for
the
world
whether
you
believe
her
or
not
does
not
settle
the
question
said
the
clerk
the
girl
had
the
key
said
the
colonel
what
if
she
had
retorted
the
merchant
and
the
ring
but
didnt
she
say
all
about
it
again
cried
the
merchant
the
fellow
had
a
temper
of
his
own
and
had
had
a
drop
too
much
besides
and
gave
the
girl
a
licking
what
could
be
simpler
well
then
hes
sorryquite
naturally
there
never
mind
says
he
take
this
why
i
heard
them
say
he
was
six
foot
five
high
i
should
think
he
must
have
weighed
about
20
stones
thats
not
the
point
said
peter
gerasimovitch
the
question
is
whether
she
was
the
instigator
and
inciter
in
this
affair
or
the
servants
it
was
not
possible
for
the
servants
to
do
it
alone
she
had
the
key
this
kind
of
random
talk
went
on
for
a
considerable
time
at
last
the
foreman
said
i
beg
your
pardon
gentlemen
but
had
we
not
better
take
our
places
at
the
table
and
discuss
the
matter
come
please
and
he
took
the
chair
the
questions
were
expressed
in
the
following
manner
1
is
the
peasant
of
the
village
borki

on
the
17th
january

in
the
town
of

with
intent
to
deprive
him
of
life
for
the
purpose
of
robbing
him
poisoned
brandy
which
caused
smelkoffs
death
and
of
having
stolen
from
him
about
2500
roubles
in
money
and
a
diamond
ring

crimes
described

is
the
meschanka
katerina

maslova
27
years
of
age
guilty
of
the
crimes
described
in
the
first
question
4
if
the
prisoner
euphemia
botchkova
is
not
guilty
according
to
the
first
question
is
she
not
guilty
of
having
on
the
17th
january
in
the
town
of
n
while
in
service
at
the
hotel
mauritania
stolen
from
a
locked
portmanteau
belonging
to
the
merchant
smelkoff
a
lodger
in
that
hotel
and
which
was
in
the
room
occupied
by
him
2500
roubles
for
which
object
she
unlocked
the
portmanteau
with
a
key
she
brought
and
fitted
to
the
lock
the
foreman
read
the
first
question
well
gentlemen
what
do
you
think
this
question
was
quickly
answered
all
agreed
to
say
guilty
as
if
convinced
that
kartinkin
had
taken
part
both
in
the
poisoning
and
the
robbery
an
old
artelshik
member
of
an
artel
an
association
of
workmen
in
which
the
members
share
profits
and
liabilities
whose
answers
were
all
in
favour
of
acquittal
was
the
only
exception
the
foreman
thought
he
did
not
understand
and
began
to
point
out
to
him
that
everything
tended
to
prove
kartinkins
guilt
the
old
man
answered
that
he
did
understand
but
still
thought
it
better
to
have
pity
on
him
we
are
not
saints
ourselves
and
he
kept
to
his
opinion
the
answer
to
the
second
question
concerning
botchkova
was
after
much
dispute
and
many
exclamations
answered
by
the
words
not
guilty
there
being
no
clear
proofs
of
her
having
taken
part
in
the
poisoninga
fact
her
advocate
had
strongly
insisted
on
the
merchant
anxious
to
acquit
maslova
insisted
that
botchkova
was
the
chief
instigator
of
it
all
many
of
the
jury
shared
this
view
but
the
foreman
wishing
to
be
in
strict
accord
with
the
law
declared
they
had
no
grounds
to
consider
her
as
an
accomplice
in
the
poisoning
after
much
disputing
the
foremans
opinion
triumphed
to
the
fourth
question
concerning
botchkova
the
answer
was
guilty
but
on
the
artelshiks
insistence
she
was
recommended
to
mercy
the
third
question
concerning
maslova
raised
a
fierce
dispute
the
foreman
maintained
she
was
guilty
both
of
the
poisoning
and
the
theft
to
which
the
merchant
would
not
agree
the
colonel
the
clerk
and
the
old
artelshik
sided
with
the
merchant
the
rest
seemed
shaky
and
the
opinion
of
the
foreman
began
to
gain
ground
chiefly
because
all
the
jurymen
were
getting
tired
and
preferred
to
take
up
the
view
that
would
bring
them
sooner
to
a
decision
and
thus
liberate
them
from
all
that
had
passed
and
from
his
former
knowledge
of
maslova
nekhludoff
was
certain
that
she
was
innocent
of
both
the
theft
and
the
poisoning
and
he
felt
sure
that
all
the
others
would
come
to
the
same
conclusion
when
he
saw
that
the
merchants
awkward
defence
evidently
based
on
his
physical
admiration
for
her
which
he
did
not
even
try
to
hide
and
the
foremans
insistence
and
especially
everybodys
weariness
were
all
tending
to
her
condemnation
he
longed
to
state
his
objections
yet
dared
not
lest
his
relations
with
maslova
should
be
discovered
he
felt
he
could
not
allow
things
to
go
on
without
stating
his
objection
and
blushing
and
growing
pale
again
was
about
to
speak
when
peter
gerasimovitch
irritated
by
the
authoritative
manner
of
the
foreman
began
to
raise
his
objections
and
said
the
very
things
nekhludoff
was
about
to
say
allow
me
one
moment
he
said
you
seem
to
think
that
her
having
the
key
proves
she
is
guilty
of
the
theft
but
what
could
be
easier
than
for
the
servants
to
open
the
portmanteau
with
a
false
key
after
she
was
gone
of
course
of
course
said
the
merchant
she
could
not
have
taken
the
money
because
in
her
position
she
would
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
it
thats
just
what
i
say
remarked
the
merchant
but
it
is
very
likely
that
her
coming
put
the
idea
into
the
servants
heads
and
that
they
grasped
the
opportunity
and
shoved
all
the
blame
on
her
peter
gerasimovitch
spoke
so
irritably
that
the
foreman
became
irritated
too
and
went
on
obstinately
defending
the
opposite
views
but
peter
gerasimovitch
spoke
so
convincingly
that
the
majority
agreed
with
him
and
decided
that
maslova
was
not
guilty
of
stealing
the
money
and
that
the
ring
was
given
her
but
when
the
question
of
her
having
taken
part
in
the
poisoning
was
raised
her
zealous
defender
the
merchant
declared
that
she
must
be
acquitted
because
she
could
have
no
reason
for
the
poisoning
the
foreman
however
said
that
it
was
impossible
to
acquit
her
because
she
herself
had
pleaded
guilty
to
having
given
the
powder
yes
but
thinking
it
was
opium
said
the
merchant
opium
can
also
deprive
one
of
life
said
the
colonel
who
was
fond
of
wandering
from
the
subject
and
he
began
telling
how
his
brotherinlaws
wife
would
have
died
of
an
overdose
of
opium
if
there
had
not
been
a
doctor
near
at
hand
to
take
the
necessary
measures
the
colonel
told
his
story
so
impressively
with
such
selfpossession
and
dignity
that
no
one
had
the
courage
to
interrupt
him
only
the
clerk
infected
by
his
example
decided
to
break
in
with
a
story
of
his
own
there
are
some
who
get
so
used
to
it
that
they
can
take
40
drops
i
have
a
relative
but
the
colonel
would
not
stand
the
interruption
and
went
on
to
relate
what
effects
the
opium
had
on
his
brotherinlaws
wife
but
gentlemen
do
you
know
it
is
getting
on
towards
five
oclock
said
one
of
the
jury
well
gentlemen
what
are
we
to
say
then
inquired
the
foreman
shall
we
say
she
is
guilty
but
without
intent
to
rob
and
without
stealing
any
property
will
that
do
peter
gerasimovitch
pleased
with
his
victory
agreed
but
she
must
be
recommended
to
mercy
said
the
merchant
all
agreed
only
the
old
artelshik
insisted
that
they
should
say
not
guilty
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
explained
the
foreman
without
intent
to
rob
and
without
stealing
any
property
therefore
not
guilty
thats
evident
all
right
thatll
do
and
we
recommend
her
to
mercy
said
the
merchant
gaily
they
were
all
so
tired
so
confused
by
the
discussions
that
nobody
thought
of
saying
that
she
was
guilty
of
giving
the
powder
but
without
the
intent
of
taking
life
nekhludoff
was
so
excited
that
he
did
not
notice
this
omission
and
so
the
answers
were
written
down
in
the
form
agreed
upon
and
taken
to
the
court
rabelais
says
that
a
lawyer
who
was
trying
a
case
quoted
all
sorts
of
laws
read
20
pages
of
judicial
senseless
latin
and
then
proposed
to
the
judges
to
throw
dice
and
if
the
numbers
proved
odd
the
defendant
would
be
right
if
not
the
plaintiff
it
was
much
the
same
in
this
case
the
resolution
was
taken
not
because
everybody
agreed
upon
it
but
because
the
president
who
had
been
summing
up
at
such
length
omitted
to
say
what
he
always
said
on
such
occasions
that
the
answer
might
be
yes
guilty
but
without
the
intent
of
taking
life
because
the
colonel
had
related
the
story
of
his
brotherinlaws
wife
at
such
great
length
because
nekhludoff
was
too
excited
to
notice
that
the
proviso
without
intent
to
take
life
had
been
omitted
and
thought
that
the
words
without
intent
nullified
the
conviction
because
peter
gerasimovitch
had
retired
from
the
room
while
the
questions
and
answers
were
being
read
and
chiefly
because
being
tired
and
wishing
to
get
away
as
soon
as
possible
all
were
ready
to
agree
with
the
decision
which
would
bring
matters
to
an
end
soonest
the
jurymen
rang
the
bell
the
gendarme
who
had
stood
outside
the
door
with
his
sword
drawn
put
the
sword
back
into
the
scabbard
and
stepped
aside
the
judges
took
their
seats
and
the
jury
came
out
one
by
one
the
foreman
brought
in
the
paper
with
an
air
of
solemnity
and
handed
it
to
the
president
who
looked
at
it
and
spreading
out
his
hands
in
astonishment
turned
to
consult
his
companions
the
president
was
surprised
that
the
jury
having
put
in
a
provisowithout
intent
to
robdid
not
put
in
a
second
provisowithout
intent
to
take
life
from
the
decision
of
the
jury
it
followed
that
maslova
had
not
stolen
nor
robbed
and
yet
poisoned
a
man
without
any
apparent
reason
just
see
what
an
absurd
decision
they
have
come
to
he
whispered
to
the
member
on
his
left
this
means
penal
servitude
in
siberia
and
she
is
innocent
surely
you
do
not
mean
to
say
she
is
innocent
answered
the
serious
member
yes
she
is
positively
innocent
i
think
this
is
a
case
for
putting
article
817
into
practice
article
817
states
that
if
the
court
considers
the
decision
of
the
jury
unjust
it
may
set
it
aside
what
do
you
think
said
the
president
turning
to
the
other
member
the
kindly
member
did
not
answer
at
once
he
looked
at
the
number
on
a
paper
before
him
and
added
up
the
figures
the
sum
would
not
divide
by
three
he
had
settled
in
his
mind
that
if
it
did
divide
by
three
he
would
agree
to
the
presidents
proposal
but
though
the
sum
would
not
so
divide
his
kindness
made
him
agree
all
the
same
i
too
think
it
should
be
done
he
said
and
you
asked
the
president
turning
to
the
serious
member
on
no
account
he
answered
firmly
as
it
is
the
papers
accuse
the
jury
of
acquitting
prisoners
what
will
they
say
if
the
court
does
it
i
shall
not
agree
to
that
on
any
account
the
president
looked
at
his
watch
it
is
a
pity
but
whats
to
be
done
and
handed
the
questions
to
the
foreman
to
read
out
all
got
up
and
the
foreman
stepping
from
foot
to
foot
coughed
and
read
the
questions
and
the
answers
all
the
court
secretary
advocates
and
even
the
public
prosecutor
expressed
surprise
the
prisoners
sat
impassive
evidently
not
understanding
the
meaning
of
the
answers
everybody
sat
down
again
and
the
president
asked
the
prosecutor
what
punishments
the
prisoners
were
to
be
subjected
to
the
prosecutor
glad
of
his
unexpected
success
in
getting
maslova
convicted
and
attributing
the
success
entirely
to
his
own
eloquence
looked
up
the
necessary
information
rose
and
said
with
simeon
kartinkin
i
should
deal
according
to
statute
1452
paragraph
93
euphemia
botchkova
according
to

etc
katerina
maslova
according
to
statute



etc
all
three
punishments
were
the
heaviest
that
could
be
inflicted
the
court
will
adjourn
to
consider
the
sentence
said
the
president
rising
everybody
rose
after
him
and
with
the
pleasant
feeling
of
a
task
well
done
began
to
leave
the
room
or
move
about
in
it
dyou
know
sirs
we
have
made
a
shameful
hash
of
it
said
peter
gerasimovitch
approaching
nekhludoff
to
whom
the
foreman
was
relating
something
why
weve
got
her
to
siberia
what
are
you
saying
exclaimed
nekhludoff
this
time
he
did
not
notice
the
teachers
familiarity
why
we
did
not
put
in
our
answer
guilty
but
without
intent
of
causing
death
the
secretary
just
told
me
the
public
prosecutor
is
for
condemning
her
to
15
years
penal
servitude
well
but
it
was
decided
so
said
the
foreman
peter
gerasimovitch
began
to
dispute
this
saying
that
since
she
did
not
take
the
money
it
followed
naturally
that
she
could
not
have
had
any
intention
of
committing
murder
but
i
read
the
answer
before
going
out
said
the
foreman
defending
himself
and
nobody
objected
i
had
just
then
gone
out
of
the
room
said
peter
gerasimovitch
turning
to
nekhludoff
and
your
thoughts
must
have
been
woolgathering
to
let
the
thing
pass
i
never
imagined
this
nekhludoff
replied
oh
you
didnt
oh
well
we
can
get
it
put
right
said
nekhludoff
oh
dear
no
its
finished
nekhludoff
looked
at
the
prisoners
they
whose
fate
was
being
decided
still
sat
motionless
behind
the
grating
in
front
of
the
soldiers
maslova
was
smiling
another
feeling
stirred
in
nekhludoffs
soul
up
to
now
expecting
her
acquittal
and
thinking
she
would
remain
in
the
town
he
was
uncertain
how
to
act
towards
her
any
kind
of
relations
with
her
would
be
so
very
difficult
but
siberia
and
penal
servitude
at
once
cut
off
every
possibility
of
any
kind
of
relations
with
her
the
wounded
bird
would
stop
struggling
in
the
gamebag
and
no
longer
remind
him
of
its
existence

when

scarlet
im

she
suddenly
cried
so
that

through

i
am
not
guilty
i
never

truth
and
sinking
on
the
bench
she
burst
into
tears
and
sobbed
aloud
when
kartinkin
and
botchkova
went
out
she
still
sat
crying
so
that
a
gendarme
had
to
touch
the
sleeve
of
her
cloak
no
it
is
impossible
to
leave
it
as
it
is
said
nekhludoff
to
himself
utterly
forgetting
his
bad
thoughts
he
did
not
know
why
he
wished
to
look
at
her
once
more
but
hurried
out
into
the
corridor
there
was
quite
a
crowd
at
the
door
the
advocates
and
jury
were
going
out
pleased
to
have
finished
the
business
and
he
was
obliged
to
wait
a
few
seconds
and
when
he
at
last
got
out
into
the
corridor
she
was
far
in
front
he
hurried
along
the
corridor
after
her
regardless
of
the
attention
he
was
arousing
caught
her
up
passed
her
and
stopped
she
had
ceased
crying
and
only
sobbed
wiping
her
red
discoloured
face
with
the
end
of
the
kerchief
on
her
head
she
passed
without
noticing
him
then
he
hurried
back
to
see
the
president
the
latter
had
already
left
the
court
and
nekhludoff
followed
him
into
the
lobby
and
went
up
to
him
just
as
he
had
put
on
his
light
grey
overcoat
and
was
taking
the
silvermounted
walkingstick
which
an
attendant
was
handing
him
sir
may
i
have
a
few
words
with
you
concerning
some
business
i
have
just
decided
upon
said
nekhludoff
i
am
one
of
the
jury
oh
certainly
prince
nekhludoff
i
shall
be
delighted
i
think
we
have
met
before
said
the
president
pressing
nekhludoffs
hand
and
recalling
with
pleasure
the
evening
when
he
first
met
nekhludoff
and
when
he
had
danced
so
gaily
better
than
all
the
young
people
what
can
i
do
for
you
there
is
a
mistake
in
the
answer
concerning
maslova
she
is
not
guilty
of
the
poisoning
and
yet
she
is
condemned
to
penal
servitude
said
nekhludoff
with
a
preoccupied
and
gloomy
air
the
court
passed
the
sentence
in
accordance
with
the
answers
you
yourselves
gave
said
the
president
moving
towards
the
front
door
though
they
did
not
seem
to
be
quite
in
accord
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
been
going
to
explain
to
the
jury
that
a
verdict
of
guilty
meant
guilty
of
intentional
murder
unless
the
words
without
intent
to
take
life
were
added
but
had
in
his
hurry
to
get
the
business
over
omitted
to
do
so
yes
but
could
not
the
mistake
be
rectified
a
reason
for
an
appeal
can
always
be
found
you
will
have
to
speak
to
an
advocate
said
the
president
putting
on
his
hat
a
little
to
one
side
and
continuing
to
move
towards
the
door
but
this
is
terrible
well
you
see
there
were
two
possibilities
before
maslova
said
the
president
evidently
wishing
to
be
as
polite
and
pleasant
to
nekhludoff
as
he
could
then
having
arranged
his
whiskers
over
his
coat
collar
he
put
his
hand
lightly
under
nekhludoffs
elbow
and
still
directing
his
steps
towards
the
front
door
he
said
you
are
going
too
yes
said
nekhludoff
quickly
getting
his
coat
and
following
him
they
went
out
into
the
bright
merry
sunlight
and
had
to
raise
their
voices
because
of
the
rattling
of
the
wheels
on
the
pavement
the
situation
is
a
curious
one
you
see
said
the
president
what
lay
before
this
maslova
was
one
of
two
things
either
to
be
almost
acquitted
and
only
imprisoned
for
a
short
time
or
taking
the
preliminary
confinement
into
consideration
perhaps
not
at
allor
siberia
there
is
nothing
between
had
you
but
added
the
words
without
intent
to
cause
death
she
would
have
been
acquitted
yes
it
was
inexcusable
of
me
to
omit
that
said
nekhludoff
thats
where
the
whole
matter
lies
said
the
president
with
a
smile
and
looked
at
his
watch
he
had
only
threequarters
of
an
hour
left
before
the
time
appointed
by
his
clara
would
elapse
now
if
you
like
to
speak
to
the
advocates
youll
have
to
find
a
reason
for
an
appeal
that
can
be
easily
done
then
turning
to
an
isvostchik
he
called
out
to
the
dvoryanskaya
30
copecks
i
never
give
more
all

your

use
my
address
is
house
dvornikoff
on
the
dvoryanskaya
its
easy
to
remember
and
he
bowed
in
a
friendly
manner
as
he
got
into
the
trap
and
drove
off
chapter
xxv
nekhludoff
consults
an
advocate
his
conversation
with
the
president
and
the
fresh
air
quieted
nekhludoff
a
little
he
now
thought
that
the
feelings
experienced
by
him
had
been
exaggerated
by
the
unusual
surroundings
in
which
he
had
spent
the
whole
of
the
morning
and
by
that
wonderful
and
startling
coincidence
still
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
take
some
steps
to
lighten
maslovas
fate
and
to
take
them
quickly
yes
at
once
it
will
be
best
to
find
out
here
in
the
court
where
the
advocate
fanarin
or
mikishin
lives
these
were
two
wellknown
advocates
whom
nekhludoff
called
to
mind
he
returned
to
the
court
took
off
his
overcoat
and
went
upstairs
in
the
first
corridor
he
met
fanarin
himself
he
stopped
him
and
told
him
that
he
was
just
going
to
look
him
up
on
a
matter
of
business
fanarin
knew
nekhludoff
by
sight
and
name
and
said
he
would
be
very
glad
to
be
of
service
to
him
though
i
am
rather
tired
still
if
your
business
will
not
take
very
long
perhaps
you
might
tell
me
what
it
is
now
will
you
step
in
here
and
he
led
nekhludoff
into
a
room
probably
some
judges
cabinet
they
sat
down
by
the
table
well
and
what
is
your
business
first
of
all
i
must
ask
you
to
keep
the
business
private
i
do
not
want
it
known
that
i
take
an
interest
in
the
affair
oh
that
of
course
well
i
was
on
the
jury
today
and
we
have
condemned
a
woman
to
siberia
an
innocent
woman
this
bothers
me
very
much
nekhludoff
to
his
own
surprise
blushed
and
became
confused
fanarin
glanced
at
him
rapidly
and
looked
down
again
listening
well
we
have
condemned
a
woman
and
i
should
like
to
appeal
to
a
higher
court
to
the
senate
you
mean
said
fanarin
correcting
him
yes
and
i
should
like
to
ask
you
to
take
the
case
in
hand
nekhludoff
wanted
to
get
the
most
difficult
part
over
and
added
i
shall
take
the
costs
of
the
case
on
myself
whatever
they
may
be
oh
we
shall
settle
all
that
said
the
advocate
smiling
with
condescension
at
nekhludoffs
inexperience
in
these
matters
what
is
the
case
nekhludoff
stated
what
had
happened
all
right
i
shall
look
the
case
through
tomorrow
or
the
day
afternobetter
on
thursday
if
you
will
come
to
me
at
six
oclock
i
will
give
you
an
answer
well
and
now
let
us
go
i
have
to
make
a
few
inquiries
here
nekhludoff
took
leave
of
him
and
went
out
this
talk
with
the
advocate
and
the
fact
that
he
had
taken
measures
for
maslovas
defence
quieted
him
still
further
he
went
out
into
the
street
the
weather
was
beautiful
and
he
joyfully
drew
in
a
long
breath
of
spring
air
he
was
at
once
surrounded
by
isvostchiks
offering
their
services
but
he
went
on
foot
a
whole
swarm
of
pictures
and
memories
of
katusha
and
his
conduct
to
her
began
whirling
in
his
brain
and
he
felt
depressed
and
everything
appeared
gloomy
no
i
shall
consider
all
this
later
on
i
must
now
get
rid
of
all
these
disagreeable
impressions
he
thought
to
himself
he
remembered
the
korchagins
dinner
and
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
not
yet
too
late
to
get
there
in
time
he
heard
the
ring
of
a
passing
tramcar
ran
to
catch
it
and
jumped
on
he
jumped
off
again
when
they
got
to
the
marketplace
took
a
good
isvostchik
and
ten
minutes
later
was
at
the
entrance
of
the
korchagins
big
house
chapter
xxvi
the

please
to

said
the
friendly
fat
doorkeeper
of
the
korchagins

opening
the

which
moved
noiselessly
on
its
patent

hinges
you
are

they
are
at
dinner
my
orders
were
to
admit
only
you
the
doorkeeper
went
as
far
as
the
staircase
and
rang
are
there
any
strangers
asked
nekhludoff
taking
off

the

handsome

with

in

and
white
gloves

from
the
landing
please
to
walk
up
your
excellency
he
said
you
are

nekhludoff
went
up
and
passed
through
the
splendid
large
dancingroom
which
he
knew
so
well
into
the
diningroom
there
the
whole
korchagin
familyexcept
the
mother
sophia
vasilievna
who
never
left
her
cabinetwere
sitting
round
the
table
at
the
head
of
the
table
sat

on

a

now
a
bank
director
korchagins
friend
and
a
liberal
next
on
the
left
side
sat
miss
rayner
the
governess
of
missys
little
sister
and
the
fouryearold
girl
herself
opposite
them

the
only
son
of
the
korchagins
a

boy
of
the

class
it
was
because
of
his
examinations
that
the
whole
family
were
still
in
town
next
to
him
sat
a
university
student
who
was
coaching
him
and
missys
cousin
michael

generally
called

opposite
him
katerina
alexeevna
a
40yearold
maiden
lady
a
slavophil
and
at
the
foot
of
the
table
sat
missy
herself
with
an
empty
place
by
her
side
ah
thats
right
sit
down
we
are
still
at
the
fish
said
old
korchagin
with
difficulty
chewing
carefully
with
his
false
teeth
and
lifting
his
bloodshot
eyes
which
had
no
visible
lids
to
them
to
nekhludoff
stephen
he
said
with
his
mouth
full
addressing
the
stout
dignified
butler
and
pointing
with
his
eyes
to
the
empty
place
though
nekhludoff
knew
korchagin
very
well
and
had
often
seen
him
at
dinner
today
this
red
face
with
the
sensual
smacking
lips
the
fat
neck
above
the
napkin
stuck
into
his
waistcoat
and
the
whole
overfed
military
figure
struck
him
very
disagreeably
then
nekhludoff
remembered
without
wishing
to
what
he
knew
of
the
cruelty
of
this
man
who
when
in
command
used
to
have
men
flogged
and
even
hanged
without
rhyme
or
reason
simply
because
he
was
rich
and
had
no
need
to
curry
favour
immediately
your
excellency
said
stephen
getting
a
large
soup
ladle
out
of
the
sideboard
which
was
decorated
with
a
number
of
silver
vases
he
made
a
sign
with
his
head
to
the
handsome
footman
who
began
at
once
to
arrange
the
untouched
knives
and
forks
and
the
napkin
elaborately
folded
with
the
embroidered
family
crest
uppermost
in
front
of
the
empty
place
next
to
missy
nekhludoff
went
round
shaking
hands
with
every
one
and
all
except
old
korchagin
and
the
ladies
rose
when
he
approached
and
this
walk
round
the
table
this
shaking
the
hands
of
people
with
many
of
whom
he
never
talked
seemed
unpleasant
and
odd
he
excused
himself
for
being
late
and
was
about
to
sit
down
between
missy
and
katerina
alexeevna
but
old
korchagin
insisted
that
if
he
would
not
take
a
glass
of
vodka
he
should
at
least
take
a
bit
of
something
to
whet
his
appetite
at
the
side
table
on
which
stood
small
dishes
of
lobster
caviare
cheese
and
salt
herrings
nekhludoff
did
not
know
how
hungry
he
was
until
he
began
to
eat
and
then
having
taken
some
bread
and
cheese
he
went
on
eating
eagerly
well
have
you
succeeded
in
undermining
the
basis
of
society
asked
kolosoff
ironically
quoting
an
expression
used
by
a
retrograde
newspaper
in
attacking
trial
by
jury
acquitted
the
culprits
and
condemned
the
innocent
have
you
undermining
the
basisundermining
the
basis
repeated
prince
korchagin
laughing
he
had
a
firm
faith
in
the
wisdom
and
learning
of
his
chosen
friend
and
companion
at
the
risk
of
seeming
rude
nekhludoff
left
kolosoffs
question
unanswered
and
sitting
down
to
his
steaming
soup
went
on
eating
do
let
him
eat
said
missy
with
a
smile
the
pronoun
him
she
used
as
a
reminder
of
her
intimacy
with
nekhludoff
kolosoff
went
on
in
a
loud
voice
and
lively
manner
to
give
the
contents
of
the
article
against
trial
by
jury
which
had
aroused
his
indignation
missys
cousin
michael
sergeivitch
endorsed
all
his
statements
and
related
the
contents
of
another
article
in
the
same
paper
missy
was
as
usual
very
distinguee
and
well
unobtrusively
well
dressed
you
must
be
terribly
tired
she
said
after
waiting
until
nekhludoff
had
swallowed
what
was
in
his
mouth
not
particularly
and
you
have
you
been
to
look
at
the
pictures
he
asked
no
we
put
that
off
we
have
been
playing
tennis
at
the
salamatoffs
it
is
quite
true
mr
crooks
plays
remarkably
well
nekhludoff
had
come
here
in
order
to
distract
his
thoughts
for
he
used
to
like
being
in
this
house
both
because
its
refined
luxury
had
a
pleasant
effect
on
him
and
because
of
the
atmosphere
of
tender
flattery
that
unobtrusively
surrounded
him
but
today
everything
in
the
house
was
repulsive
to
himeverything
beginning
with
the
doorkeeper
the
broad
staircase
the
flowers
the
footman
the
table
decorations
up
to
missy
herself
who
today
seemed
unattractive
and
affected
kolosoffs
selfassured
trivial
tone
of
liberalism
was
unpleasant
as
was
also
the
sensual
selfsatisfied
bulllike
appearance
of
old
korchagin
and
the
french
phrases
of
katerina
alexeevna
the
slavophil
the
constrained
looks
of
the
governess
and
the
student
were
unpleasant
too
but
most
unpleasant
of
all
was
the
pronoun
him
that
missy
had
used
nekhludoff
had
long
been
wavering
between
two
ways
of
regarding
missy
sometimes
he
looked
at
her
as
if
by
moonlight
and
could
see
in
her
nothing
but
what
was
beautiful
fresh
pretty
clever
and
natural
then
suddenly
as
if
the
bright
sun
shone
on
her
he
saw
her
defects
and
could
not
help
seeing
them
this
was
such
a
day
for
him
today
he
saw
all
the
wrinkles
of
her
face
knew
which
of
her
teeth
were
false
saw
the
way
her
hair
was
crimped
the
sharpness
of
her
elbows
and
above
all
how
large
her
thumbnail
was
and
how
like
her
fathers
tennis
is
a
dull
game
said
kolosoff
we
used
to
play
lapta
when
we
were
children
that
was
much
more
amusing
oh
no
you
never
tried
it
its
awfully
interesting
said
missy
laying
it
seemed
to
nekhludoff
a
very
affected
stress
on
the
word
awfully
then
a
dispute
arose
in
which
michael
sergeivitch
katerina
alexeevna
and
all
the
others
took
part
except
the
governess
the
student
and
the
children
who
sat
silent
and
wearied
oh
these
everlasting
disputes
said
old
korchagin
laughing
and
he
pulled
the
napkin
out
of
his
waistcoat
noisily
pushed
back
his
chair
which
the
footman
instantly
caught
hold
of
and
left
the
table
everybody
rose
after
him
and
went
up
to
another
table
on
which
stood
glasses
of
scented
water
they
rinsed
their
mouths
then
resumed
the
conversation
interesting
to
no
one
dont
you
think
so
said
missy
to
nekhludoff
calling
for
a
confirmation
of
the
statement
that
nothing
shows
up
a
mans
character
like
a
game
she
noticed
that
preoccupied
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
dissatisfied
look
which
she
feared
and
she
wanted
to
find
out
what
had
caused
it
really
i
cant
tell
i
have
never
thought
about
it
nekhludoff
answered
will
you
come
to
mamma
asked
missy
yes
yes
he
said
in
a
tone
which
plainly
proved
that
he
did
not
want
to
go
and
took
out
a
cigarette
she
looked
at
him
in
silence
with
a
questioning
look
and
he
felt
ashamed
to
come
into
a
house
and
give
the
people
the
dumps
he
thought
about
himself
then
trying
to
be
amiable
said
that
he
would
go
with
pleasure
if
the
princess
would
admit
him
oh
yes
mamma
will
be
pleased
you
may
smoke
there
and
ivan
ivanovitch
is
also
there
the
mistress
of
the
house
princess
sophia
vasilievna
was
a
recumbent
lady
it
was
the
eighth
year
that
when
visitors
were
present
she
lay
in
lace
and
ribbons
surrounded
with
velvet
gilding
ivory
bronze
lacquer
and
flowers
never
going
out
and
only
as
she
put
it
receiving
intimate
friends
ie
those
who
according
to
her
idea
stood
out
from
the
common
herd
nekhludoff
was
admitted
into
the
number
of
these
friends
because
he
was
considered
clever
because
his
mother
had
been
an
intimate
friend
of
the
family
and
because
it
was
desirable
that
missy
should
marry
him

vasilievnas
room
lay
beyond
the
large
and
the
small
drawingrooms
in
the
large
drawingroom
missy
who
was
in
front
of
nekhludoff
stopped
resolutely
and
taking
hold
of
the
back
of
a
small
green
chair
faced
him
missy
was
very
anxious
to
get
married
and
as
he
was
a
suitable
match
and
she
also
liked
him
she
had
accustomed
herself
to
the
thought
that
he
should
be
hers
not
she
his
to
lose
him
would
be
very
mortifying
she
now
began
talking
to
him
in
order
to
get
him
to
explain
his
intentions
i
see
something
has
happened
she
said
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
remembered
the
meeting
in
the
law
court
and
frowned
and
blushed
yes
something
has
happened
he
said
wishing
to
be
truthful
a
very
unusual
and
serious
event
what
is
it
then
can
you
not
tell
me
what
it
is
she
was
pursuing
her
aim
with
that
unconscious
yet
obstinate
cunning
often
observable
in
the
mentally
diseased
not
now
please
do
not
ask
me
to
tell
you
i
have
not
yet
had
time
fully
to
consider
it
and
he
blushed
still
more
and
so
you
will
not
tell
me
a
muscle
twitched
in
her
face
and
she
pushed
back
the
chair
she
was
holding
well
then
come
she
shook
her
head
as
if
to
expel
useless
thoughts
and
faster
than
usual
went
on
in
front
of
him
he
fancied
that
her
mouth
was
unnaturally
compressed
in
order
to
keep
back
the
tears
he
was
ashamed
of
having
hurt
her
and
yet
he
knew
that
the
least
weakness
on
his
part
would
mean
disaster
ie
would
bind
him
to
her
and
today
he
feared
this
more
than
anything
and
silently
followed
her
to
the
princesss
cabinet

missys

princess
sophia
vasilievna
missys
mother
had
finished
her
very
elaborate
and
nourishing
dinner
she
had
it
always
alone
that
no
one
should
see
her
performing
this
unpoetical
function
by
her
couch
stood
a
small
table
with
her
coffee
and
she
was
smoking
a
pachitos
princess
sophia
vasilievna
was
a
long
thin
woman
with
dark
hair
large
black
eyes
and
long
teeth
and
still
pretended
to
be
young
her
intimacy
with
the
doctor
was
being
talked
about
nekhludoff
had
known
that
for
some
time
but
when
he
saw
the
doctor
sitting
by
her
couch
his
oily
glistening
beard
parted
in
the
middle
he
not
only
remembered
the
rumours
about
them
but
felt
greatly
disgusted
by
the
table
on
a
low
soft
easy
chair
next
to
sophia
vasilievna
sat
kolosoff
stirring
his
coffee
a
glass
of
liqueur
stood
on
the
table
missy
came
in
with
nekhludoff
but
did
not
remain
in
the
room
when
mamma
gets
tired
of
you
and
drives
you
away
then
come
to
me
she
said
turning
to
kolosoff
and
nekhludoff
speaking
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
then
she
went
away
smiling
merrily
and
stepping
noiselessly
on
the
thick
carpet
how
do
you
do
dear
friend
sit
down
and
talk
said
princess
sophia
vasilievna
with
her
affected
but
very
naturallyacted
smile
showing
her
fine
long
teetha
splendid
imitation
of
what
her
own
had
once
been
i
hear
that
you
have
come
from
the
law
courts
very
much
depressed
i
think
it
must
be
very
trying
to
a
person
with
a
heart
she
added
in
french
yes
that
is
so
said
nekhludoff
one
often
feels
ones
own
deone
feels
one
has
no
right
to
judge
comme
cest
vrai
she
cried
as
if
struck
by
the
truth
of
this
remark
she
was
in
the
habit
of
artfully
flattering
all
those
with
whom
she
conversed
well
and
what
of
your
picture
it
does
interest
me
so
if
i
were
not
such
a
sad
invalid
i
should
have
been
to
see
it
long
ago
she
said
i
have
quite
given
it
up
nekhludoff
replied
drily
the
falseness
of
her
flattery
seemed
as
evident
to
him
today
as
her
age
which
she
was
trying
to
conceal
and
he
could
not
put
himself
into
the
right
state
to
behave
politely
oh
that
is
a
pity
why
he
has
a
real
talent
for
art
i
have
it
from
repins
own
lips
she
added
turning
to
kolosoff
why
is
it
she
is
not
ashamed
of
lying
so
nekhludoff
thought
and
frowned
when
she
had
convinced
herself
that
nekhludoff
was
in
a
bad
temper
and
that
one
could
not
get
him
into
an
agreeable
and
clever
conversation
sophia
vasilievna
turned
to
kolosoff
asking
his
opinion
of
a
new
play
she
asked
it
in
a
tone
as
if
kolosoffs
opinion
would
decide
all
doubts
and
each
word
of
this
opinion
be
worthy
of
being
immortalised
kolosoff
found
fault
both
with
the
play
and
its
author
and
that
led
him
to
express
his
views
on
art
princess
sophia
vasilievna
while
trying
at
the
same
time
to
defend
the
play
seemed
impressed
by
the
truth
of
his
arguments
either
giving
in
at
once
or
at
least
modifying
her
opinion
nekhludoff
looked
and
listened
but
neither
saw
nor
heard
what
was
going
on
before
him
listening
now
to
sophia
vasilievna
now
to
kolosoff
nekhludoff
noticed
that
neither
he
nor
she
cared
anything
about
the
play
or
each
other
and
that
if
they
talked
it
was
only
to
gratify
the
physical
desire
to
move
the
muscles
of
the
throat
and
tongue
after
having
eaten
and
that
kolosoff
having
drunk
vodka
wine
and
liqueur
was
a
little
tipsy
not
tipsy
like
the
peasants
who
drink
seldom
but
like
people
to
whom
drinking
wine
has
become
a
habit
he
did
not
reel
about
or
talk
nonsense
but
he
was
in
a
state
that
was
not
normal
excited
and
selfsatisfied
nekhludoff
also
noticed
that
during
the
conversation
princess
sophia
vasilievna
kept
glancing
uneasily
at
the
window
through
which
a
slanting
ray
of
sunshine
which
might
vividly
light
up
her
aged
face
was
beginning
to
creep
up
how
true
she
said
in
reference
to
some
remark
of
kolosoffs
touching
the
button
of
an
electric
bell
by
the
side
of
her
couch
the
doctor
rose
and
like
one
who
is
at
home
left
the
room
without
saying
anything
sophia
vasilievna
followed
him
with
her
eyes
and
continued
the
conversation
please
philip
draw
these
curtains
she
said
pointing
to
the
window
when
the
handsome
footman
came
in
answer
to
the
bell
no
whatever
you
may
say
there
is
some
mysticism
in
him
without
mysticism
there
can
be
no
poetry
she
said
with
one
of
her
black
eyes
angrily
following
the
footmans
movements
as
he
was
drawing
the
curtains
without
poetry
mysticism
is
superstition
without
mysticism
poetry
isprose
she
continued
with
a
sorrowful
smile
still
not
losing
sight
of
the
footman
and
the
curtains
philip
not
that
curtain
the
one
on
the
large
window
she
exclaimed
in
a
suffering
tone
sophia
vasilievna
was
evidently
pitying
herself
for
having
to
make
the
effort
of
saying
these
words
and
to
soothe
her
feelings
she
raised
to
her
lips
a
scented
smoking
cigarette
with
her
jewelbedecked
fingers
the
broadchested
muscular
handsome
philip
bowed
slightly
as
if
begging
pardon
and
stepping
lightly
across
the
carpet
with
his
broadcalved
strong
legs
obediently
and
silently
went
to
the
other
window
and
looking
at
the
princess
carefully
began
to
arrange
the
curtain
so
that
not
a
single
ray
dared
fall
on
her
but
again
he
did
not
satisfy
her
and
again
she
had
to
interrupt
the
conversation
about
mysticism
and
correct
in
a
martyred
tone
the
unintelligent
philip
who
was
tormenting
her
so
pitilessly
for
a
moment
a
light
flashed
in
philips
eyes
the
devil
take
you
what
do
you
want
was
probably
what
he
said
to
himself
thought
nekhludoff
who
had
been
observing
all
this
scene
but
the
strong
handsome
philip
at
once
managed
to
conceal
the
signs
of
his
impatience
and
went
on
quietly
carrying
out
the
orders
of
the
worn
weak
false
sophia
vasilievna
of
course
there
is
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
lombrosos
teaching
said
kolosoff
lolling
back
in
the
low
chair
and
looking
at
sophia
vasilievna
with
sleepy
eyes
but
he
overstepped
the
mark
oh
yes
and
you
do
you
believe
in
heredity
asked
sophia
vasilievna
turning
to
nekhludoff
whose
silence
annoyed
her
in
heredity
he
asked
no
i
dont
at
this
moment
his
whole
mind
was
taken
up
by
strange
images
that
in
some
unaccountable
way
rose
up
in
his
imagination
by
the
side
of
this
strong
and
handsome
philip
he
seemed
at
this
minute
to
see
the
nude
figure
of
kolosoff
as
an
artists
model
with
his
stomach
like
a
melon
his
bald
head
and
his
arms
without
muscle
like
pestles
in
the
same
dim
way
the
limbs
of
sophia
vasilievna
now
covered
with
silks
and
velvets
rose
up
in
his
mind
as
they
must
be
in
reality
but
this
mental
picture
was
too
horrid
and
he
tried
to
drive
it
away
well
you
know
missy
is
waiting
for
you
she
said
go
and
find
her
she
wants
to
play
a
new
piece
by
grieg
to
you
it
is
most
interesting
she
did
not
mean
to
play
anything
the
woman
is
simply
lying
for
some
reason
or
other
thought
nekhludoff
rising
and
pressing
sophia
vasilievnas
transparent
and
bony
ringed
hand
katerina
alexeevna
met
him
in
the
drawingroom
and
at
once
began
in
french
as
usual
i
see
the
duties
of
a
juryman
act
depressingly
upon
you
yes
pardon
me
i
am
in
low
spirits
today
and
have
no
right
to
weary
others
by
my
presence
said
nekhludoff
why
are
you
in
low
spirits
allow
me
not
to
speak
about
that
he
said
looking
round
for
his
hat
dont
you
remember
how
you
used
to
say
that
we
must
always
tell
the
truth
and
what
cruel
truths
you
used
to
tell
us
all
why
do
you
not
wish
to
speak
out
now
dont
you
remember
missy
she
said
turning
to
missy
who
had
just
come
in
we
were
playing
a
game
then
said
nekhludoff
seriously
one
may
tell
the
truth
in
a
game
but
in
reality
we
are
so
badi
mean
i
am
so
badthat
i
at
least
cannot
tell
the
truth
oh
do
not
correct
yourself
but
rather
tell
us
why
we
are
so
bad
said
katerina
alexeevna
playing
with
her
words
and
pretending
not
to
notice
how
serious
nekhludoff
was
nothing
is
worse
than
to
confess
to
being
in
low
spirits
said
missy
i
never
do
it
and
therefore
am
always
in
good
spirits
nekhludoff
felt
as
a
horse
must
feel
when
it
is
being
caressed
to
make
it
submit
to
having
the
bit
put
in
its
mouth
and
be
harnessed
and
today
he
felt
less
than
ever
inclined
to
draw
well
are
you
coming
into
my
room
we
will
try
to
cheer
you
up
he
excused
himself
saying
he
had
to
be
at
home
and
began
taking
leave
missy
kept
his
hand
longer
than
usual
remember
that
what
is
important
to
you
is
important
to
your
friends
she
said
are
you
coming
tomorrow
i
hardly
expect
to
said
nekhludoff
and
feeling
ashamed
without
knowing
whether
for
her
or
for
himself
he
blushed
and
went
away
what
is
it
comme

missy
was
going
to
say
but
stopped
and
looked
down
with
a
face
from
which
all
the
light
had
gonea
very
different
face
from
the
one
with
which
she
had
looked
at
him
she
would
not
mention
to
katerina
alexeevna
even
so
vulgar
a
pun
but
only
said
we
all
have
our
good
and
our
bad
days
is
it
possible
that
he
too
will
deceive
she
thought
after
all
that
has
happened
it
would
be
very
bad
of
him
if
missy
had
had
to
explain
what
she
meant
by
after
all
that
has
happened
she
could
have
said
nothing
definite
and
yet
she
knew
that
he
had
not
only
excited
her
hopes
but
had
almost
given
her
a
promise
no
definite
words
had
passed
between
themonly
looks
and
smiles
and
hints
and
yet
she
considered
him
as
her
own
and
to
lose
him
would
be
very
hard

xxviii
the
awakening
shameful
and
stupid
horrid
and
shameful
nekhludoff
kept
saying
to
himself
as
he
walked
home
along
the
familiar
streets
the
depression
he
had
felt
whilst
speaking
to
missy
would
not
leave
him
he
felt
that
looking
at
it
externally
as
it
were
he
was
in
the
right
for
he
had
never
said
anything
to
her
that
could
be
considered
binding
never
made
her
an
offer
but
he
knew
that
in
reality
he
had
bound
himself
to
her
had
promised
to
be
hers
and
yet
today
he
felt
with
his
whole
being
that
he
could
not
marry
her
shameful
and
horrid
horrid
and
shameful
he
repeated
to
himself
with
reference
not
only
to
his
relations
with
missy
but
also
to
the
rest
everything
is
horrid
and
shameful
he
muttered
as
he
stepped
into
the
porch
of
his
house
i
am
not
going
to
have
any
supper
he
said
to
his
manservant
corney
who
followed
him
into
the
diningroom
where
the
cloth
was
laid
for
supper
and
tea
you
may
go
yes
sir
said
corney
yet
he
did
not
go
but
began
clearing
the
supper
off
the
table
nekhludoff
looked
at
corney
with
a
feeling
of
illwill
he
wished
to
be
left
alone
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
everybody
was
bothering
him
in
order
to
spite
him
when
corney
had
gone
away
with
the
supper
things
nekhludoff
moved
to
the
tea
urn
and
was
about
to
make
himself
some
tea
but
hearing
agraphena
petrovnas
footsteps
he
went
hurriedly
into
the
drawingroom
to
avoid
being
seen
by
her
and
shut
the
door
after
him
in
this
drawingroom
his
mother
had
died
three
months
before
on
entering
the
room
in
which
two
lamps
with
reflectors
were
burning
one
lighting
up
his
fathers
and
the
other
his
mothers
portrait
he
remembered
what
his
last
relations
with
his
mother
had
been
and
they
also
seemed
shameful
and
horrid
he
remembered
how
during
the
latter
period
of
her
illness
he
had
simply
wished
her
to
die
he
had
said
to
himself
that
he
wished
it
for
her
sake
that
she
might
be
released
from
her
suffering
but
in
reality
he
wished
to
be
released
from
the
sight
of
her
sufferings
for
his
own
sake
trying
to
recall
a
pleasant
image
of
her
he
went
up
to
look
at
her
portrait
painted
by
a
celebrated
artist
for
800
roubles
she
was
depicted
in
a
very
lownecked
black
velvet
dress
there
was
something
very
revolting
and
blasphemous
in
this
representation
of
his
mother
as
a
halfnude
beauty
it
was
all
the
more
disgusting
because
three
months
ago
in
this
very
room
lay
this
same
woman
dried
up
to
a
mummy
and
he
remembered
how
a
few
days
before
her
death
she
clasped
his
hand
with
her
bony
discoloured
fingers
looked
into
his
eyes
and
said
do
not
judge
me
mitia
if
i
have
not
done
what
i
should
and
how
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
grown
pale
with
suffering
ah
how
horrid
he
said
to
himself
looking
up
once
more
at
the
halfnaked
woman
with
the
splendid
marble
shoulders
and
arms
and
the
triumphant
smile
on
her
lips
oh
how
horrid
the
bared
shoulders
of
the
portrait
reminded
him
of
another
a
young
woman
whom
he
had
seen
exposed
in
the
same
way
a
few
days
before
it
was
missy
who
had
devised
an
excuse
for
calling
him
into
her
room
just
as
she
was
ready
to
go
to
a
ball
so
that
he
should
see
her
in
her
ball
dress
it
was
with
disgust
that
he
remembered
her
fine
shoulders
and
arms
and
that
father
of
hers
with
his
doubtful
past
and
his
cruelties
and
the
belesprit
her
mother
with
her
doubtful
reputation
all
this
disgusted
him
and
also
made
him
feel
ashamed
shameful
and
horrid
horrid
and
shameful
no
no
he
thought
freedom
from
all
these
false
relations
with
the
korchagins
and
mary
vasilievna
and
the
inheritance
and
from
all
the
rest
must
be
got
oh
to
breathe
freely
to
go
abroad
to
rome
and
work
at
my
picture
he
remembered
the
doubts
he
had
about
his
talent
for
art
well
never
mind
only
just
to
breathe
freely
first
constantinople
then
rome
only
just
to
get
through
with
this
jury
business
and
arrange
with
the
advocate
first
then
suddenly
there
arose
in
his
mind
an
extremely
vivid
picture
of
a
prisoner
with
black
slightlysquinting
eyes
and
how
she
began
to
cry
when
the
last
words
of
the
prisoners
had
been
heard
and
he
hurriedly
put
out
his
cigarette
pressing
it
into
the
ashpan
lit
another
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
one
after
another
the
scenes
he
had
lived
through
with
her
rose
in
his
mind
he
recalled
that
last
interview
with
her
he
remembered
the
white
dress
and
blue
sash
the
early
mass
why
i
loved
her
really
loved
her
with
a
good
pure
love
that
night
i
loved
her
even
before
yes
i
loved
her
when
i
lived
with
my
aunts
the
first
time
and
was
writing
my
composition
and
he
remembered
himself
as
he
had
been
then
a
breath
of
that
freshness
youth
and
fulness
of
life
seemed
to
touch
him
and
he
grew
painfully
sad
the
difference
between
what
he
had
been
then
and
what
he
was
now
was
enormousjust
as
great
if
not
greater
than
the
difference
between
katusha
in
church
that
night
and
the
prostitute
who
had
been
carousing
with
the
merchant
and
whom
they
judged
this
morning
then
he
was
free
and
fearless
and
innumerable
possibilities
lay
ready
to
open
before
him
now
he
felt
himself
caught
in
the
meshes
of
a
stupid
empty
valueless
frivolous
life
out
of
which
he
saw
no
means
of
extricating
himself
even
if
he
wished
to
which
he
hardly
did
he
remembered
how
proud
he
was
at
one
time
of
his
straightforwardness
how
he
had
made
a
rule
of
always
speaking
the
truth
and
really
had
been
truthful
and
how
he
was
now
sunk
deep
in
lies
in
the
most
dreadful
of
lieslies
considered
as
the
truth
by
all
who
surrounded
him
and
as
far
as
he
could
see
there
was
no
way
out
of
these
lies
he
had
sunk
in
the
mire
got
used
to
it
indulged
himself
in
it
how
was
he
to
break
off
his
relations
with
mary
vasilievna
and
her
husband
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
able
to
look
him
and
his
children
in
the
eyes
how
disentangle
himself
from
missy
how
choose
between
the
two
oppositesthe
recognition
that
holding
land
was
unjust
and
the
heritage
from
his
mother
how
atone
for
his
sin
against
katusha
this
last
at
any
rate
could
not
be
left
as
it
was
he
could
not
abandon
a
woman
he
had
loved
and
satisfy
himself
by
paying
money
to
an
advocate
to
save
her
from
hard
labour
in
siberia
she
had
not
even
deserved
hard
labour
atone
for
a
fault
by
paying
money
had
he
not
then
when
he
gave
her
the
money
thought
he
was
atoning
for
his
fault
and
he
clearly
recalled
to
mind
that
moment
when
having
caught
her
up
in
the
passage
he
thrust
the
money
into
her
bib
and
ran
away
oh
that
money
he
thought
with
the
same
horror
and
disgust
he
had
then
felt
oh
dear
oh
dear
how
disgusting
he
cried
aloud
as
he
had
done
then
only
a
scoundrel
a
knave
could
do
such
a
thing
and
i
am
that
knave
that
scoundrel
he
went
on
aloud
but
is
it
possiblehe
stopped
and
stood
stillis
it
possible
that
i
am
really
a
scoundrel



well
who
but
i
he
answered
himself
and
then
is
this
the
only
thing
he
went
on
convicting
himself
was
not
my
conduct
towards
mary
vasilievna
and
her
husband
base
and
disgusting
and
my
position
with
regard
to
money
to
use
riches
considered
by
me
unlawful
on
the
plea
that
they
are
inherited
from
my
mother
and
the
whole
of
my
idle
detestable
life
and
my
conduct
towards
katusha
to
crown
all
knave
and
scoundrel
let
men
judge
me
as
they
like
i
can
deceive
them
but
myself
i
cannot
deceive
and
suddenly
he
understood
that
the
aversion
he
had
lately
and
particularly
today
felt
for
everybodythe
prince
and
sophia
vasilievna
and
corney
and
missywas
an
aversion
for
himself
and
strange
to
say
in
this
acknowledgement
of
his
baseness
there
was
something
painful
yet
joyful
and
quieting
more
than
once
in
nekhludoffs
life
there
had
been
what
he
called
a
cleansing
of
the
soul
by
cleansing
of
the
soul
he
meant
a
state
of
mind
in
which
after
a
long
period
of
sluggish
inner
life
a
total
cessation
of
its
activity
he
began
to
clear
out
all
the
rubbish
that
had
accumulated
in
his
soul
and
was
the
cause
of
the
cessation
of
the
true
life
his
soul
needed
cleansing
as
a
watch
does
after
such
an
awakening
nekhludoff
always
made
some
rules
for
himself
which
he
meant
to
follow
forever
after
wrote
his
diary
and
began
afresh
a
life
which
he
hoped
never
to
change
again
turning
over
a
new
leaf
he
called
it
to
himself
in
english
but
each
time
the
temptations
of
the
world
entrapped
him
and
without
noticing
it
he
fell
again
often
lower
than
before
thus
he
had
several
times
in
his
life
raised
and
cleansed
himself
the
first
time
this
happened
was
during
the
summer
he
spent
with
his
aunts
that
was
his
most
vital
and
rapturous
awakening
and
its
effects
had
lasted
some
time
another
awakening
was
when
he
gave
up
civil
service
and
joined
the
army
at
war
time
ready
to
sacrifice
his
life
but
here
the
chokingup
process
was
soon
accomplished
then
an
awakening
came
when
he
left
the
army
and
went
abroad
devoting
himself
to
art
from
that
time
until
this
day
a
long
period
had
elapsed
without
any
cleansing
and
therefore
the
discord
between
the
demands
of
his
conscience
and
the
life
he
was
leading
was
greater
than
it
had
ever
been
before
he
was
horrorstruck
when
he
saw
how
great
the
divergence
was
it
was
so
great
and
the
defilement
so
complete
that
he
despaired
of
the
possibility
of
getting
cleansed
have
you
not
tried
before
to
perfect
yourself
and
become
better
and
nothing
has
come
of
it
whispered
the
voice
of
the
tempter
within
what
is
the
use
of
trying
any
more
are
you
the
only
oneall
are
alike
such
is
life
whispered
the
voice
but
the
free
spiritual
being
which
alone
is
true
alone
powerful
alone
eternal
had
already
awakened
in
nekhludoff
and
he
could
not
but
believe
it
enormous
though
the
distance
was
between
what
he
wished
to
be
and
what
he
was
nothing
appeared
insurmountable
to
the
newlyawakened
spiritual
being
at
any
cost
i
will
break
this
lie
which
binds
me
and
confess
everything
and
will
tell
everybody
the
truth
and
act
the
truth
he
said
resolutely
aloud
i
shall
tell
missy
the
truth
tell
her
i
am
a
profligate
and
cannot
marry
her
and

only
uselessly
upset
her
i
shall
tell
mary
vasilievna


oh
there
is
nothing
to
tell
her
i

tell
her
husband

scoundrel
that

deceiving
him
i
shall
dispose
of
the
inheritance
in
such
a
way
as
to
acknowledge
the
truth
i
shall
tell
her
katusha
that
i
am
a
scoundrel
and

towards

do

i
can
to

yes
i
will
see
her
and
will
ask
her
to

yes
i
will
beg

pardon
as

do



he
stoppedwill
marry
her
if
necessary
he
stopped
again
folded
his
hands
in
front
of
his
breast
as
he
used
to
do
when
a
little
child
lifted
his
eyes
and
said
addressing
some
one
lord
help
me
teach
me
come
enter
within
me
and
purify
me
of
all
this
abomination
he
prayed
asking
god
to
help
him
to
enter
into
him
and
cleanse
him
and
what
he
was
praying
for
had
happened
already
the
god
within
him
had
awakened
his
consciousness
he
felt
himself
one
with
him
and
therefore
felt
not
only
the
freedom
fulness
and
joy
of
life
but
all
the
power
of
righteousness
all
all
the
best
that
a
man
could
do
he
felt
capable
of
doing
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
he
was
saying
all
this
to
himself
good
and
bad
tears
good
because
they
were
tears
of
joy
at
the
awakening
of
the
spiritual
being
within
him
the
being
which
had
been
asleep
all
these
years
and
bad
tears
because
they
were
tears
of
tenderness
to
himself
at
his
own
goodness
he
felt
hot
and
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
the
window
opened
into
a
garden
it
was
a
moonlit
quiet
fresh
night
a
vehicle
rattled
past
and
then
all
was
still
the
shadow
of
a
tall
poplar
fell
on
the
ground
just
opposite
the
window
and
all
the
intricate
pattern
of
its
bare
branches
was
clearly
defined
on
the
clean
swept
gravel
to
the
left
the
roof
of
a
coachhouse
shone
white
in
the
moonlight
in

the

shadow
of

was
visible
through
the

of
the

gazed
at
the
roof
the
moonlit
garden
and
the
shadows
of
the
poplar
and
drank
in
the
fresh
invigorating
air
how
delightful
how
delightful
oh
god
how
delightful

maslova
in
prison
maslova
reached
her
cell
only
at
six
in
the
evening
tired
and
footsore
having
unaccustomed
as
she
was
to
walking
gone
10
miles
on
the
stony
road
that
day
she
was
crushed
by
the
unexpectedly
severe
sentence
and
tormented
by
hunger
during
the
first
interval
of
her
trial
when
the
soldiers
were
eating
bread
and
hardboiled
eggs
in
her
presence
her
mouth
watered
and
she
realised
she
was
hungry
but
considered
it
beneath
her
dignity
to
beg
of
them
three
hours
later
the
desire
to
eat
had
passed
and
she
felt
only
weak
it
was
then
she
received
the
unexpected
sentence
at
first
she
thought
she
had
made
a
mistake
she
could
not
imagine
herself
as
a
convict
in
siberia
and
could
not
believe
what
she
heard
but
seeing
the
quiet
businesslike
faces
of
judges
and
jury
who
heard
this
news
as
if
it
were
perfectly
natural
and
expected
she
grew
indignant
and
proclaimed
loudly
to
the
whole
court
that
she
was
not
guilty
finding
that
her
cry
was
also
taken
as
something
natural
and
expected
and
feeling
incapable
of
altering
matters
she
was
horrorstruck
and
began
to
weep
in
despair
knowing
that
she
must
submit
to
the
cruel
and
surprising
injustice
that
had
been
done
her
what
astonished
her
most
was
that
young
menor
at
any
rate
not
old
menthe
same
men
who
always
looked
so
approvingly
at
her
one
of
them
the
public
prosecutor
she
had
seen
in
quite
a
different
humour
had
condemned
her
while
she
was
sitting
in
the
prisoners
room
before
the
trial
and
during
the
intervals
she
saw
these
men
looking
in
at
the
open
door
pretending
they
had
to
pass
there
on
some
business
or
enter
the
room
and
gaze
on
her
with
approval
and
then
for
some
unknown
reason
these
same
men
had
condemned
her
to
hard
labour
though
she
was
innocent
of
the
charge
laid
against
her
at
first
she
cried
but
then
quieted
down
and
sat
perfectly
stunned
in
the
prisoners
room
waiting
to
be
led
back
she
wanted
only

found
her
when
they
were
led
into
the
same
room
after
being
sentenced
botchkova
began
at
once
to
scold
her
and
call
her
a
convict

maslova
sat
with
her
hands
inside
her
sleeves
hanging
her
head
and
looking
in
front
of
her
at
the
dirty
floor
without
moving
only
saying
i
dont
bother

you
bother
me
i
dont
bother
you
do
i
she
repeated
this
several
times
and
was
silent
again
she
did
brighten
up
a
little
when
botchkova
and
kartinkin
were
led
away
and
an
attendant
brought
her
three
roubles

this
money
was
sent
by
kitaeva
the
keeper
of
the
house
in
which
she
used
to
live
as
she
was
leaving
the
court
she
turned
to
the
usher
with
the
question
whether
she
might
give
maslova
a
little
money
the
usher
said
she
might
having
got
permission
she
removed
the
threebuttoned
swedish
kid
glove
from
her
plump
white
hand
and
from
an
elegant
purse
brought
from
the
back
folds
of
her
silk
skirt
took
a
pile
of
coupons

she
had
earned

50

one
10copeck
coins
and
gave
all
this
to
the
usher
the
usher
called
an
attendant
and
in
his
presence
gave
the
money
belease
to
giff
it
accurately
said
carolina
albertovna
kitaeva
the
attendant
was
hurt
by
her
want
of
confidence
and
that
was
why
he
treated
maslova
so
brusquely
maslova
was
glad
of
the
money
because
it
could
give
her
the
only
thing
she
now
desired
if
i
could
but
get
cigarettes
and
take
a
whiff
she
said
to
herself
and
all
her
thoughts
centred
on
the
one
desire
to
smoke
and
drink
she
longed
for
spirits
so
that
she
tasted
them
and
felt
the
strength
they
would
give
her
and
she
greedily
breathed
in
the
air
when
the
fumes
of
tobacco
reached
her
from
the
door
of
a
room
that
opened
into
the
corridor
but
she
had
to
wait
long
for
the
secretary
who
should
have
given
the
order
for
her
to
go
forgot
about
the
prisoners
while
talking
and
even
disputing
with
one
of
the
advocates
about
the
article
forbidden
by
the
censor
at
last
about
five
oclock
she
was
allowed
to
go
and
was
led
away
through
the
back
door
by
her
escort
the
nijni
man
and
the
tchoovash
then
still
within
the
entrance
to
the
law
courts
she
gave
them
50
copecks
asking
them
to
get
her
two
rolls
and
some
cigarettes
the
tchoovash
laughed
took
the
money
and
said
all
right
ill
get
em
and
really
got
her
the
rolls
and
the
cigarettes
and
honestly
returned
the
change
she
was
not
allowed
to
smoke
on
the
way
and
with
her
craving
unsatisfied
she
continued
her
way
to
the
prison
when
she
was
brought
to
the
gate
of
the
prison

the

the
cell
in

was
imprisoned

and
10
feet
broad
it
had
two
windows
and
a

twothirds
of
the
space
were
taken
up
by
shelves
used
as
beds
the
planks
they
were
made
of
had
warped
and
shrunk
opposite
the

hung
a

with
a
wax

a
bunch
of
everlastings
hanging
down
from
it
by
the

to

there
was
a
dark
spot
on
the

on
which
stood
a

tub
the

had
taken

were
locked

quite
light
only
two
of
the
women
were
lying
down
a
consumptive
woman
imprisoned
for
theft
and
an
idiot
who
spent
most
of
her
time
in
sleep
and
who
was
arrested
because
she
had
no
passport
the
consumptive
woman
was
not
asleep
but
lay
with
wide
open
eyes
her
cloak
folded
under
her
head
trying
to
keep
back
the
phlegm
that
irritated
her
throat
and
not
to
cough
some
of
the
other
women
most
of
whom
had
nothing
on
but
coarse
brown
holland
chemises
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
convicts

in
the
yard
and
some
sat
sewing

in
a
short
plait

up
to
their
daughter
she
was
at
the
head
of
the
women
in
the
cell
and
found
means
of
carrying
on
a
trade
in
spirits
with
them
beside
her
sat
another
woman
sewing
a
coarse
canvas
sack

was
the
wife
of
a
railway
watchman

watchmens
cottages
at
distances
of
about
one
mile
from
each

and
the
watchmen
or
their
wives
have
to
meet
every
train
imprisoned
for
three
months
because
she
did
not
come
out
with
the
flags
to
meet
a
train
that
was
passing
and
an
accident
had
occurred
she
was
a
short
snubnosed
woman
with
small
black
eyes
kind
and
talkative
the
third
of
the
women
who
were
sewing
was
theodosia
a
quiet
young
girl
white
and
rosy
very
pretty

wedding
she
had
been
given
in
marriage
without
her
consent
at
the
age
of
16
because
her
husband
would
give
her
no
peace
but
in
the
eight
months
during
which
she
had
been
let
out
on
bail
she
had
not
only
made
it
up
with
her
husband
but
come
to
love
him
so
that
when
her
trial
came
they
were
heart
and
soul
to
one
another
although
her
husband
her
fatherinlaw
but
especially
her
motherinlaw
who
had
grown
very
fond
of
her
did
all
they
could
to
get

the
kind
merry
eversmiling
theodosia
had
a
place
next
maslovas
on
the
shelf
bed
and
had
grown
so
fond
of
her
that
she
took
it
upon
herself
as
a
duty
to
attend
and
wait
on
her
two
other
women
were
sitting
without
any
work
at
the
other
end
of
the
shelf
bedstead
one
was
a
woman
of
about
40
with
a
pale
thin
face
who
once
probably
had
been
very
handsome
she
sat
with
her
baby
at
her
thin
white
breast
the
crime
she
had
committed
was
that
when
a
recruit
was
according
to
the
peasants
view
unlawfully
taken
from
their
village
and
the
people
stopped
the
police
officer
and
took
the
recruit
away
from
him
she
an
aunt
of
the
lad
unlawfully
taken
was
the
first
to
catch
hold
of
the
bridle
of
the
horse
on
which
he
was
being
carried
off
the
other
who
sat
doing
nothing
was
a
kindly
greyhaired
old
woman
hunchbacked
and
with
a
flat
bosom
she
sat
behind
the
stove
on
the
bedshelf
and
pretended
to
catch
a
fat
fouryearold
boy
who
ran
backwards
and
forwards
in
front
of
her
laughing
gaily
this
boy
had
only
a
little
shirt
on
and
his
hair
was
cut
short
as
he
ran
past
the
old
woman
he
kept
repeating
there
havent
caught
me
this
old
woman
and
her
son
were
accused
of
incendiarism
she
bore
her
imprisonment
with
perfect
cheerfulness
but
was
concerned
about
her
son
and
chiefly
about
her
old
man
who
she
feared
would
get
into
a
terrible
state
with
no
one
to
wash
for
him
besides
these
seven
women
there
were
four
standing
at
one
of
the
open
windows
holding
on
to
the
iron
bars
they
were
making
signs
and
shouting
to
the
convicts
whom
maslova
had
met
when
returning
to
prison
and
who
were
now
passing
through
the
yard
one
of
these
women
was
big
and
heavy
with
a
flabby
body
red
hair
and
freckled
on
her
pale
yellow
face
her
hands
and
her
fat
neck
she
shouted
something
in
a
loud
raucous
voice
and
laughed
hoarsely
this
woman
was
serving
her
term
for
theft
beside
her
stood
an
awkward
dark
little
woman
no
bigger
than
a
child
of
ten
with
a
long
waist
and
very
short
legs
a
red
blotchy
face
thick
lips
which
did
not
hide
her
long
teeth
and
eyes
too
far
apart
she
broke
by
fits
and
starts
into
screeching
laughter
at
what
was
going
on
in
the
yard
she
was
to
be
tried
for
stealing
and
incendiarism
they
called
her
khoroshavka
behind
her
in
a
very
dirty
grey
chemise
stood
a
thin
miserablelooking
pregnant
woman
who
was
to
be
tried
for
concealment
of
theft
this
woman
stood
silent
but
kept
smiling
with
pleasure
and
approval
at
what
was
going
on
below
with
these
stood
a
peasant
woman
of
medium
height
the
mother
of
the
boy
who
was
playing
with
the
old
woman
and
of
a
sevenyearold
girl
these
were
in
prison
with
her
because
she
had
no
one
to
leave
them
with
she
was
serving
her
term
of
imprisonment
for
illicit
sale
of
spirits
she
stood
a
little
further
from
the
window
knitting
a
stocking
and
though
she
listened
to
the
other
prisoners
words
she
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
frowned
and
closed
her
eyes
but
her
sevenyearold
daughter
stood
in
her
little
chemise
her
flaxen
hair
done
up
in
a
little
pigtail
her
blue
eyes
fixed
and
holding
the
redhaired
woman
by
the
skirt
attentively
listened
to
the
words
of
abuse
that
the
women
and
the
convicts
flung
at
each
other
and
repeated
them
softly
as
if
learning
them
by
heart
the
twelfth
prisoner
who
paid
no
attention
to
what
was
going
on
was
a
very
tall
stately
girl
the
daughter
of
a
deacon
who
had
drowned
her
baby
in
a
well
she
went
about
with
bare
feet
wearing
only
a
dirty
chemise
the
thick
short
plait
of
her
fair
hair
had
come
undone
and
hung
down
dishevelled
and
she
paced
up
and
down
the
free
space
of
the
cell
not
looking
at
any
one
turning
abruptly
every
time
she
came
up
to
the
wall

the

when
the
padlock
rattled
and
the
door
opened
to
let
maslova
into
the
cell
all
turned
towards
her
even
the
deacons
daughter
stopped
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
her
with
lifted
brows
before
resuming
her
steady
striding
up
and
down
korableva
stuck
her
needle
into
the
brown
sacking
and
looked
questioningly
at
maslova
through
her
spectacles
eh

took
off
her
spectacles
and
put
her
work
down
beside
her
on
the
shelf
bed
and

the
watchmans
wife
began
in
her
singing
voice
yes

were
wondering
whys
she
so
long
and
now
just
see

it
is
well
our
guessing
was
no

on
in
musical
tones
is
it
possible
have
they
sentenced
you
asked
theodosia
with
concern
looking
at
maslova
with
her
bright
blue
childlike
eyes
and
her
merry
young
face
changed
as
if
she
were
going
to
cry
maslova
did
not
answer
but
went
on
to
her
place
the
second
from
the
end
and
sat
down
beside
korableva
have
you
eaten
anything
said
theodosia
rising
and
coming
up
to
maslova
maslova
gave
no
reply
but
putting
the
rolls
on
the
bedstead
took
off
her
dusty
cloak
the
kerchief
off
her
curly
black
head
and
began
pulling
off
her
shoes
the
old
woman
who
had
been
playing
with
the
boy
came
up
and
stood
in
front
of
maslova
tz
tz
tz
she
clicked
with
her
tongue
shaking
her
head
pityingly
the
boy
also
came
up
with
her
and
putting
out
his
upper
lip
stared
with
wide
open
eyes
at
the
roll
maslova
had
brought
when
maslova
saw
the
sympathetic
faces
of
her
fellowprisoners
her
lips
trembled
and
she
felt
inclined
to
cry
but
she
succeeded
in
restraining
herself
until
the
old
woman
and
the
boy
came
up
when
she
heard
the
kind
pitying
clicking
of
the
old
womans
tongue
and
met
the
boys
serious
eyes
turned
from
the
roll
to
her
face
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
her
face
quivered
and
she
burst
into
sobs
didnt
i
tell
you
to
insist
on
having
a
proper
advocate
said
norableva
well
what
is
it
exile
maslova
could
not
answer
but
took
from
inside
the
roll
a
box
of
cigarettes
on
which
was
a
picture
of
a
lady
with
hair
done
up
very
high
and
dress
cut
low
in
front
and
passed
the
box
to
korableva
korableva
looked
at
it
and
shook
her
head
chiefly
because
see
did
not
approve
of
maslovas
putting
her
money
to
such
bad
use
but
still
she
took
out
a
cigarette
lit
it
at
the
lamp
took
a
puff
and
almost
forced
it
into
maslovas
hand
maslova
still
crying
began
greedily
to
inhale
the
tobacco
smoke
penal
servitude
she
muttered
blowing
out
the
smoke
and
sobbing
dont
they
fear
the
lord
the
cursed
soulslayers
muttered
korableva
sentencing
the
lass
for
nothing
at
this
moment
the
sound
of
loud
coarse
laughter
came
from
the
women
who
were
still
at
the
window
the
little
girl
also
laughed
and
her
childish
treble
mixed
with
the
hoarse
and
screeching
laughter
of
the
others
one
of
the
convicts
outside
had
done
something
that
produced
this
effect
on
the
onlookers
lawks
see
the
shaved
hound
what
hes
doing
said
the
redhaired
woman
her
whole
fat
body
shaking
with
laughter
and
leaning
against
the
grating
she
shouted
meaning
less
obscene
words
ugh
the
fat
frights
cackling
said
korableva
who
disliked
the
redhaired
woman
then
turning
to
maslova
again
she
asked
how
many
years
four
said
maslova
and
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
in
such
profusion
that
one
fell
on
the
cigarette
maslova
crumpled
it
up
angrily
and
took
another
though
the
watchmans
wife
did
not
smoke
she
picked
up
the
cigarette
maslova
had
thrown
away
and
began
straightening
it
out
talking
unceasingly
there
now
ducky
so
its
true
she
said
truths
gone
to
the
dogs
and
they
do
what
they
please
and
here
we
were
guessing
that
youd
go
free
norableva
says

i
say
no
say
i
no
dear
my
heart
tells
me
theyll
give
it
her
and
so
its
turned
out
she
went
on
evidently
listening
with
pleasure
to
her
own
voice
the
women
who
had
been
standing
by
the
window
now
also
came
up
to
maslova
the
convicts
who
had
amused
them
having
gone
away
the
first
to
come
up
were
the
woman
imprisoned
for
illicit
trade
in
spirits
and
her
little
girl
why
such
a
hard
sentence
asked
the
woman
sitting
down
by
maslova
and
knitting
fast
why
so
hard
because
theres
no
money
thats
why

there
been

and

lawyer

their
tricks

hired

the
old
woman
who
was
imprisoned
for
incendiarism
only
think
to
entice
the
lads
wife
and
lock
him
himself
up
to
feed
vermin
and
me
too
in
my
old
days
she
began
to
retell
her
story
for
the
hundredth

if
it
isnt
the

yes

staff
and
the

dont
wait
for
an
invitation
ah
it
seems
thats
the
way
with
all

said
the
spirit

and
after
looking
at
her
little
girl
she
put
down
her
knitting
and
drawing
the
child
between
her
knees
began
to
search
her
head
with
deft
fingers
why
do
you
sell
spirits
she
went
on
why
but
whats
one
to
feed
the
children
on
these
words
brought
back
to
maslovas
mind
her
craving
for

a
little
vodka
she
said
to
korableva
wiping
the

with
her
sleeve

maslova
got
the
money
which
she
had
also
hidden
in
a
roll
and
passed
the
coupon
to
korableva
korableva
accepted
it
though
she
could
not
read
trusting
to
khoroshavka
who
knew
everything
and
who
said
that
the
slip
of
paper
was
worth
2
roubles
50
copecks
then
climbed
up
to
the
ventilator
where
she
had
hidden
a
small
flask
of
vodka
seeing
this
the
women
whose
places
were
further
off
went
away
meanwhile
maslova
shook
the
dust
out
of
her
cloak
and
kerchief
got
up
on
the
bedstead
and
began
eating
a
roll
i
kept
your
tea
for
you
said
theodosia
getting
down
from
the
shelf
a
mug
and
a
tin
teapot
wrapped
in
a
rag
but
im
afraid
it
is
quite
cold
the
liquid
was
quite
cold
and
tasted
more
of
tin
than
of
tea
yet
maslova
filled
the
mug
and
began
drinking
it
with
her
roll
finashka
here
you
are
she
said
breaking
off
a
bit
of
the
roll
and
giving
it
to
the
boy
who
stood
looking
at
her
mouth
meanwhile
korableva
handed
the
flask
of
vodka
and
a
mug
to
maslova
who
offered
some
to
her
and
to
khoroshavka
these
prisoners
were
considered
the
aristocracy
of
the
cell
because
they
had
some
money
and
shared
what
they
possessed
with
the
others
in
a
few
moments
maslova
brightened
up
and
related
merrily
what
had
happened
at
the
court
and
what
had
struck
her
most
ie
how
all
the
men
had
followed
her
wherever
she
went
in
the
court
they
all
looked
at
her
she
said
and
kept
coming
into
the
prisoners
room
while
she
was
there
one
of
the
soldiers
even
says
its
all
to
look
at
you
that
they
come
one
would
come
in
where
is
such
a
paper
or
something
but
i
see
it
is
not
the
paper
he
wants
he
just
devours
me
with
his
eyes
she
said
shaking
her
head
regular
artists
yes
thats
so
said
the
watchmans
wife
and
ran
on
in
her
musical
strain
theyre
like
flies
after
sugar
and
here
too
maslova
interrupted
her
the
same
thing
they
can
do
without
anything
else
but
the
likes
of
them
will
go
without
bread
sooner
than
miss
that
hardly
had
they
brought
me
back
when
in
comes
a
gang
from
the
railway
they
pestered
me
so
i
did
not
know
how
to
rid
myself
of
them
thanks
to
the
assistant
he
turned
them
off

said
khoroshavka
who
managed
to
exchange
notes
with
the
male
prisoners
and
knew
all
that
went
on
in
the
prison

does
go

said
korableva
turning
to
maslova
but
youd
better
tell
us
now
what
the
advocate
says
about
petitioning
nows
the
time
to
hand

in
maslova
answered
that
she
knew
nothing
about
it
at
that
moment
the
redhaired
woman
came
up
to
the
aristocracy
with
both
freckled
hands
in
her
thick
hair
scratching
her
head
with
her
nails
ill
tell
you
all
about
it
katerina
she
began
first
and
foremost

have
to
write

dissatisfied
with

sentence
then

notice
to

procureur

maslova
always
ready
to
share
anything
she
possessed
with
anybody
ill
offer
her
something
come
on
then
said
the
redhaired
one
advancing
towards
korableva
ah

im
afraid
of
such
as
you
convict
fright
thats
her
as
says
it
slut
i
a
slut
convict
murderess
screamed
the
redhaired
one
go
away
i
tell
you
said
korableva
gloomily
but
the
redhaired
one
came
nearer
and
korableva
struck
her
in
the
chest
the
redhaired
woman
seemed
only
to
have
waited
for
this
and
with
a
sudden
movement
caught
hold
of
korablevas
hair
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
struck
her
in
the
face
korableva
seized
this
hand
and
maslova
and
khoroshavka
caught
the
redhaired
woman
by
her
arms
trying
to
pull
her
away
but
she
let
go
the
old
womans
hair
with
her
hand
only
to
twist
it
round
her
fist
korableva
with
her
head
bent
to
one
side
was
dealing
out
blows
with
one
arm
and
trying
to
catch
the
redhaired
womans
hand
with
her
teeth
while
the
rest
of
the
women
crowded
round
screaming
and
trying
to
separate
the
fighters
even
the
consumptive
one
came
up
and
stood
coughing
and
watching
the
fight
the
children
cried
and
huddled
together
the
noise
brought
the
woman
warder
and
a
jailer
the
fighting
women
were
separated
and
korableva
taking
out
the
bits
of
torn
hair
from
her
head
and
the
redhaired
one
holding
her
torn
chemise
together
over
her
yellow
breast
began
loudly
to
complain
i
know
its
all
the
vodka
wait
a
bit
ill
tell
the
inspector
tomorrow
hell
give
it
you
cant
i
smell
it
mind
get
it
all
out
of
the
way
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
said
the
warder
weve
no
time
to
settle
your
disputes
get
to
your
places
and
be
quiet
but
quiet
was
not
soon
reestablished
for
a
long
time
the
women
went
on
disputing
and
explaining
to
one
another
whose
fault
it
all
was
at
last
the
warder
and
the
jailer
left
the
cell
the
women
grew
quieter
and
began
going
to
bed
and
the
old
woman
went
to
the
icon
and
commenced
praying
the
two
jailbirds
have
met
the
redhaired
woman
suddenly
called
out
in
a
hoarse
voice
from
the
other
end
of
the
shelf
beds
accompanying
every
word
with
frightfully
vile
abuse
mind
you
dont
get
it
again
korableva
replied
also
adding
words
of
abuse
and
both
were
quiet
again
had
i
not
been
stopped
id
have
pulled
your
damned
eyes
out
again
began
the
redhaired
one
and
an
answer
of
the
same
kind
followed
from
korableva
then
again
a
short
interval
and
more
abuse
but
the
intervals
became
longer
and
longer
as
when
a
thundercloud
is
passing
and
at
last
all
was
quiet
all
were
in
bed
some
began
to
snore
and
only
the
old
woman
who
always
prayed
a
long
time
went
on
bowing
before
the
icon
and
the
deacons
daughter
who
had
got
up
after
the
warder
left
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
again
maslova
kept
thinking
that
she
was
now
a
convict
condemned
to
hard
labour
and
had
twice
been
reminded
of
thisonce
by
botchkova
and
once
by
the
redhaired
womanand
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
the
thought
korableva
who
lay
next
to
her
turned
over
in
her
bed
there
now
said
maslova
in
a
low
voice
who
would
have
thought
it
see
what
others
do
and
get
nothing
for
it
never
mind
girl
people
manage
to
live
in
siberia
as
for
you
youll
not
be
lost
there
either
korableva
said
trying
to
comfort
her
i
know
ill
not
be
lost
still
it
is
hard
its
not
such
a
fate
i
wanti
who
am
used
to
a
comfortable
life
ah
one
cant
go
against
god
said
korableva
with
a
sigh
one
cant
my
dear
i
know
granny
still
its
hard
they
were
silent
for
a
while
do
you
hear
that
baggage
whispered
korableva
drawing
maslovas
attention
to
a
strange
sound
proceeding
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
this
sound
was
the
smothered
sobbing
of
the
redhaired
woman
the
redhaired
woman
was
crying
because
she
had
been
abused
and
had
not
got
any
of
the
vodka
she
wanted
so
badly
also
because
she
remembered
how
all
her
life
she
had
been
abused
mocked
at
offended
beaten
remembering
this
she
pitied
herself
and
thinking
no
one
heard
her
began
crying
as
children
cry
sniffing
with
her
nose
and
swallowing
the
salt
tears
im
sorry
for
her
said
maslova
of
course
one
is
sorry
said
korableva
but
she
shouldnt
come
bothering
chapter
xxxiii
the
leaven
at
worknekhludoffs
domestic
changes
the
next
morning
nekhludoff
awoke
conscious
that
something
had
happened
to
him
and
even
before
he
had
remembered
what
it
was
he
knew
it
to
be
something
important
and
good
katushathe
trial
yes
he
must
stop
lying
and
tell
the
whole
truth
by
a
strange
coincidence
on
that
very
morning
he
received
the
longexpected
letter
from
mary
vasilievna
the
wife
of
the
marechal
de
noblesse
the
very
letter
he
particularly
needed
she
gave
him
full
freedom
and
wished
him
happiness
in
his
intended
marriage
marriage
he
repeated
with
irony
how
far
i
am
from
all
that
at
present
and
he
remembered
the
plans
he
had
formed
the
day
before
to
tell
the
husband
everything
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
express
his
readiness
to
give
him
any
kind
of
satisfaction
but
this
morning
this
did
not
seem
so
easy
as
the
day
before
and
then
also
why
make
a
man
unhappy
by
telling
him
what
he
does
not
know
yes
if
he
came
and
asked
he
would
tell
him
all
but
to
go
purposely
and
tellno
that
was
unnecessary
and
telling
the
whole
truth
to
missy
seemed
just
as
difficult
this
morning
again
he
could
not
begin
to
speak
without
offence
as
in
many
worldly
affairs
something
had
to
remain
unexpressed
only
one
thing
he
decided
on
ie
not
to
visit
there
and
to
tell
the
truth
if
asked
but
in
connection
with
katusha
nothing
was
to
remain
unspoken
i
shall
go
to
the
prison
and
shall
tell
her
every
thing
and
ask
her
to
forgive
me
and
if
need
beyes
if
need
be
i
shall
marry
her
he
thought
this
idea
that
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
all
on
moral
grounds
and
marry
her
again
made
him
feel
very
tender
towards
himself
concerning
money
matters
he
resolved
this
morning
to
arrange
them
in
accord
with
his
conviction
that
the
holding
of
landed
property
was
unlawful
even
if
he
should
not
be
strong
enough
to
give
up
everything
he
would
still
do
what
he
could
not
deceiving
himself
or
others
it
was
long
since
he
had
met
the
coming
day
with
so
much
energy
when
agraphena
petrovna
came
in
he
told
her
with
more
firmness
than
he
thought
himself
capable
of
that
he
no
longer
needed
this
lodging
nor
her
services
there
had
been
a
tacit
understanding
that
he
was
keeping
up
so
large
and
expensive
an
establishment
because
he
was
thinking
of
getting
married
the
giving
up
of
the
house
had
therefore
a
special
meaning
agraphena
petrovna
looked
at
him
in
surprise
i
thank
you
very
much
agraphena
petrovna

your
care
for
me
but
i
no
longer
require
so
large
a
house
nor
so
many
servants
if
you
wish
to
help
me
be
so
good
as
to
settle
about
the
things
put
them
away
as
it
used
to
be
done
during
mammas
life
and
when
natasha
comes
she
will
see
to
everything
natasha
was
nekhludoffs
sister
agraphena
petrovna
shook
her
head
see
about
the
things
why
theyll
be
required
again
she
said
no
they
wont
agraphena
petrovna
i
assure
you
they
wont
be
required
said
nekhludoff
in
answer
to
what
the
shaking
of
her
head
had
expressed
please
tell
corney
also
that
i
shall
pay
him
two
months
wages
but
shall
have
no
further
need
of
him
it
is
a
pity
dmitri
ivanovitch
that
you
should
think
of
doing
this
she
said
well
supposing
you
go
abroad
still
youll
require
a
place
of
residence
again
you
are
mistaken
in
your
thoughts
agraphena
petrovna
i
am
not
going
abroad
if
i
go
on
a
journey
it
will
be
to
quite
a
different
place
he
suddenly
blushed
very
red
yes
i
must
tell
her
he
thought
no
hiding
everybody
must
be
told
a
very
strange
and
important
thing
happened
to
me
yesterday
do
you
remember
my
aunt
mary
ivanovnas
katusha
oh
yes
why
i
taught
her
how
to
sew
well
this
katusha
was
tried
in
the
court
and
i
was
on
the
jury
oh
lord
what
a
pity
cried
agraphena
petrovna
what
was
she
being
tried
for
murder
and
it
is
i
have
done
it
all
well
now
this
is
very
strange
how
could
you
do
it
all
yes
i
am
the
cause
of
it
all
and
it
is
this
that
has
altered
all
my
plans
what
difference
can
it
make
to
you
this
difference
that
i
being
the
cause
of
her
getting
on
to
that
path
must
do
all
i
can
to
help
her
that
is
just
according
to
your
own
good
pleasure
you
are
not
particularly
in
fault
there
it
happens
to
every
one
and
if
ones
reasonable
it
all
gets
smoothed
over
and
forgotten
she
said
seriously
and
severely
why
should
you
place
it
to
your
account
theres
no
need
i
had
already
heard
before
that
she
had
strayed
from
the
right
path
well
whose
fault
is
it
mine
thats
why
i
want
to
put
it
right
it
is
hard
to
put
right
that
is
my
business
but
if
you
are
thinking
about
yourself
then
i
will
tell
you
that
as
mamma
expressed
the
wish
i
am
not
thinking
about
myself
i
have
been
so
bountifully
treated
by
the
dear
defunct
that
i
desire
nothing
lisenka
her
married
niece
has
been
inviting
me
and
i
shall
go
to
her
when
i
am
not
wanted
any
longer
only
it
is
a
pity
you
should
take
this
so
to
heart
it
happens
to
everybody
well
i
do
not
think
so
and
i
still
beg
that
you
will
help
me
let
this
lodging
and
put
away
the
things
and
please
do
not
be
angry
with
me
i
am
very
very
grateful
to
you
for
all
you
have
done
and
strangely
from
the
moment
nekhludoff
realised
that
it
was
he
who
was
so
bad
and
disgusting
to
himself
others
were
no
longer
disgusting
to
him
on
the
contrary
he
felt
a
kindly
respect
for
agraphena
petrovna
and
for
corney
he
would
have
liked
to
go
and
confess
to
corney
also
but
corneys
manner
was
so
insinuatingly
deferential
that
he
had
not
the
resolution
to
do
it
on
the
way
to
the
law
courts
passing
along
the
same
streets
with
the
same
isvostchik
as
the
day
before
he
was
surprised
what
a
different
being
he
felt
himself
to
be
the
marriage
with
missy
which
only
yesterday
seemed
so
probable
appeared
quite
impossible
now
the
day
before
he
felt
it
was
for
him
to
choose
and
had
no
doubts
that
she
would
be
happy
to
marry
him
today
he
felt
himself
unworthy
not
only
of
marrying
but
even
of
being
intimate
with
her
if
she
only
knew
what
i
am
nothing
would
induce
her
to
receive
me
and
only
yesterday
i
was
finding
fault
with
her
because
she
flirted
with
n
anyhow
even
if
she
consented
to
marry
me
could
i
be
i
wont
say
happy
but
at
peace
knowing
that
the
other
was
here
in
prison
and
would
today
or
tomorrow
he
taken
to
siberia
with
a
gang
of
other
prisoners
while
i
accepted
congratulations
and
made
calls
with
my
young
wife
or
while
i
count
the
votes
at
the
meetings
for
and
against
the
motion
brought
forward
by
the
rural
inspection
etc
together
with
the
marechal
de
noblesse
whom
i
abominably
deceive
and
afterwards
make
appointments
with
his
wife
how
abominable
or
while
i
continue
to
work
at
my
picture
which
will
certainly
never
get
finished
besides
i
have
no
business
to
waste
time
on
such
things
i
can
do
nothing
of
the
kind
now
he
continued
to
himself
rejoicing
at
the
change
he
felt
within
himself
the
first
thing
now
is
to
see
the
advocate
and
find
out
his
decision
and
then



then
go
and
see
her
and
tell
her
everything
and
when
he
pictured
to
himself
how
he
would
see
her
and
tell
her
all
confess
his
sin
to
her
and
tell
her
that
he
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
atone
for
his
sin
he
was
touched
at
his
own
goodness
and
the
tears
came
to
his
eyes
chapter
xxxiv
the
absurdity
of
lawreflections
of
a
juryman
on
coming
into
the
law
courts
nekhludoff
met
the
usher
of
yesterday
who
today
seemed
to
him
much
to
be
pitied
in
the
corridor
and
asked
him
where
those
prisoners
who
had
been
sentenced
were
kept
and
to
whom
one
had
to
apply
for
permission
to
visit
them
the
usher
told
him
that
the
condemned
prisoners
were
kept
in
different
places
and
that
until
they
received
their
sentence
in
its
final
form
the
permission
to
visit
them
depended
on
the
president
ill
come
and
call
you
myself
and
take
you
to
the
president
after
the
session
the
president
is
not
even
here
at
present
after
the
session
and
now
please
come
in
we
are
going
to
commence
nekhludoff
thanked
the
usher
for
his
kindness
and
went
into
the
jurymens
room
as
he
was
approaching
the
room
the
other
jurymen
were
just
leaving
it
to
go
into
the
court
the
merchant
had
again
partaken
of
a
little
refreshment
and
was
as
merry
as
the
day
before
and
greeted
nekhludoff
like
an
old
friend
and
today
peter
gerasimovitch
did
not
arouse
any
unpleasant
feelings
in
nekhludoff
by
his
familiarity
and
his
loud
laughter
nekhludoff
would
have
liked
to
tell
all
the
jurymen
about
his
relations
to
yesterdays
prisoner
by
rights
he
thought
i
ought
to
have
got
up
yesterday
during
the
trial
and
disclosed
my
guilt
he
entered
the
court
with
the
other
jurymen
and
witnessed
the
same
procedure
as
the
day
before
the
judges
are
coming
was
again
proclaimed
and
again
three
men
with
embroidered
collars
ascended
the
platform
and
there
was
the
same
settling
of
the
jury
on
the
highbacked
chairs
the
same
gendarmes
the
same
portraits
the
same
priest
and
nekhludoff
felt
that
though
he
knew
what
he
ought
to
do
he
could
not
interrupt
all
this
solemnity
the
preparations
for
the
trials
were
just
the
same
as
the
day
before
excepting
that
the
swearing
in
of
the
jury
and
the
presidents
address
to
them
were
omitted
the
case
before
the
court
this
day
was
one
of
burglary
the
prisoner
guarded
by
two
gendarmes
with
naked
swords
was
a
thin
narrowchested
lad
of
20
with
a
bloodless
sallow
face
dressed
in
a
grey
cloak
he
sat
alone
in
the
prisoners
dock
this
boy
was
accused
of
having
together
with
a
companion
broken
the
lock
of
a
shed
and
stolen
several
old
mats
valued
at
3
roubles
the
rouble
is
worth
a
little
over
two
shillings
and
contains
100
copecks
and
67
copecks
according
to
the
indictment
a
policeman
had
stopped
this
boy
as
he
was
passing
with
his
companion
who
was
carrying
the
mats
on
his
shoulder
the
boy
and
his
companion
confessed
at
once
and
were
both
imprisoned
the
boys
companion
a
locksmith
died
in
prison
and
so
the
boy
was
being
tried
alone
the
old
mats
were
lying
on
the
table
as
the
objects
of
material
evidence
the
business
was
conducted
just
in
the
same
manner
as
the
day
before
with
the
whole
armoury
of
evidence
proofs
witnesses
swearing
in
questions
experts
and
crossexaminations
in
answer
to
every
question
put
to
him
by
the
president
the
prosecutor
or
the
advocate
the
policeman
one
of
the
witnesses
in
variably
ejected
the
words
just
so
or
cant
tell
yet
in
spite
of
his
being
stupefied
and
rendered
a
mere
machine
by
military
discipline
his
reluctance
to
speak
about
the
arrest
of
this
prisoner
was
evident
another
witness
an
old
house
proprietor
and
owner
of
the
mats
evidently
a
rich
old
man
when
asked
whether
the
mats
were
his
reluctantly
identified
them
as
such
when
the
public
prosecutor
asked
him
what
he
meant
to
do
with
these
mats
what
use
they
were
to
him
he
got
angry
and
answered
the
devil
take
those
mats
i
dont
want
them
at
all
had
i
known
there
would
be
all
this
bother
about
them
i
should
not
have
gone
looking
for
them
but
would
rather
have
added
a
tenrouble
note
or
two
to
them
only
not
to
be
dragged
here
and
pestered
with
questions
i
have
spent
a
lot
on
isvostchiks
besides
i
am
not
well
i
have
been
suffering
from
rheumatism
for
the
last
seven
years
it
was
thus
the
witness
spoke
the
accused
himself
confessed
everything
and
looking
round
stupidly
like
an
animal
that
is
caught
related
how
it
had
all
happened
still
the
public
prosecutor
drawing
up
his
shoulders
as
he
had
done
the
day
before
asked
subtle
questions
calculated
to
catch
a
cunning
criminal
in
his
speech
he
proved
that
the
theft
had
been
committed
from
a
dwellingplace
and
a
lock
had
been
broken
and
that
the
boy
therefore
deserved
a
heavy
punishment
the
advocate
appointed
by
the
court
proved
that
the
theft
was
not
committed
from
a
dwellingplace
and
that
though
the
crime
was
a
serious
one
the
prisoner
was
not
so
very
dangerous
to
society
as
the
prosecutor
stated
the
president
assumed
the
role
of
absolute
neutrality
in
the
same
way
as
he
had
done
on
the
previous
day
and
impressed
on
the
jury
facts
which
they
all
knew
and
could
not
help
knowing
then
came
an
interval
just
as
the
day
before
and
they
smoked
and
again
the
usher
called
out
the
judges
are
coming
and
in
the
same
way
the
two
gendarmes
sat
trying
to
keep
awake
and
threatening
the
prisoner
with
their
naked
weapons
the
proceedings
showed
that
this
boy
was
apprenticed
by
his
father
at
a
tobacco
factory
where
he
remained
five
years
this
year
he
had
been
discharged
by
the
owner
after
a
strike
and
having
lost
his
place
he
wandered
about
the
town
without
any
work
drinking
all
he
possessed
in
a
traktir
cheap
restaurant
he
met
another
like
himself
who
had
lost
his
place
before
the
prisoner
had
a
locksmith
by
trade
and
a
drunkard
one
night
those
two
both
drunk
broke
the
lock
of
a
shed
and
took
the
first
thing
they
happened
to
lay
hands
on
they
confessed
all
and
were
put
in
prison
where
the
locksmith
died
while
awaiting
the
trial
the
boy
was
now
being
tried
as
a
dangerous
creature
from
whom
society
must
be
protected
just
as
dangerous
a
creature
as
yesterdays
culprit
thought
nekhludoff
listening
to
all
that
was
going
on
before
him
they
are
dangerous
and
we
who
judge
them
i
a
rake
an
adulterer
a
deceiver
we
are
not
dangerous
but
even
supposing
that
this
boy
is
the
most
dangerous
of
all
that
are
here
in
the
court
what
should
be
done
from
a
commonsense
point
of
view
when
he
has
been
caught
it
is
clear
that
he
is
not
an
exceptional
evildoer
but
a
most
ordinary
boy
every
one
sees
itand
that
he
has
become
what
he
is
simply
because
he
got
into
circumstances
that
create
such
characters
and
therefore
to
prevent
such
a
boy
from
going
wrong
the
circumstances
that
create
these
unfortunate
beings
must
be
done
away
with
but
what
do
we
do
we
seize
one
such
lad
who
happens
to
get
caught
knowing
well
that
there
are
thousands
like
him
whom
we
have
not
caught
and
send
him
to
prison
where
idleness
or
most
unwholesome
useless
labour
is
forced
on
him
in
company
of
others
weakened
and
ensnared
by
the
lives
they
have
led
and
then
we
send
him
at
the
public
expense
from
the
moscow
to
the
irkoutsk
government
in
company
with
the
most
depraved
of
men
but
we
do
nothing
to
destroy
the
conditions
in
which
people
like
these
are
produced
on
the
contrary
we
support
the
establishments
where
they
are
formed
these
establishments
are
well
known
factories
mills
workshops
publichouses
ginshops
brothels
and
we
do
not
destroy
these
places
but
looking
at
them
as
necessary
we
support
and
regulate
them
we
educate
in
this
way
not
one
but
millions
of
people
and
then
catch
one
of
them
and
imagine
that
we
have
done
something
that
we
have
guarded
ourselves
and
nothing
more
can
be
expected
of
us
have
we
not
sent
him
from
the
moscow
to
the
irkoutsk
government
thus
thought
nekhludoff
with
unusual
clearness
and
vividness
sitting
in
his
highbacked
chair
next
to
the
colonel
and
listening
to
the
different
intonations
of
the
advocates
prosecutors
and
presidents
voices
and
looking
at
their
selfconfident
gestures
and
how
much
and
what
hard
effort
this
pretence
requires
continued
nekhludoff
in
his
mind
glancing
round
the
enormous
room
the
portraits
lamps
armchairs
uniforms
the
thick
walls
and
large
windows
and
picturing
to
himself
the
tremendous
size
of
the
building
and
the
still
more
ponderous
dimensions
of
the
whole
of
this
organisation
with
its
army
of
officials
scribes
watchmen
messengers
not
only
in
this
place
but
all
over
russia
who
receive
wages
for
carrying
on
this
comedy
which
no
one
needs
supposing
we
spent
onehundredth
of
these
efforts
helping
these
castaways
whom
we
now
only
regard
as
hands
and
bodies
required
by
us
for
our
own
peace
and
comfort
had
some
one
chanced
to
take
pity
on
him
and
given
some
help
at
the
time
when
poverty
made
them
send
him
to
town
it
might
have
been
sufficient
nekhludoff
thought
looking
at
the
boys
piteous
face
or
even
later
when
after
12
hours
work
at
the
factory
he
was
going
to
the
publichouse
led
away
by
his
companions
had
some
one
then
come
and
said
dont
go
vania
it
is
not
right
he
would
not
have
gone
nor
got
into
bad
ways
and
would
not
have
done
any
wrong
but
no
no
one
who
would
have
taken
pity
on
him
came
across
this
apprentice
in
the
years
he
lived
like
a
poor
little
animal
in
the
town
and
with
his
hair
cut
close
so
as
not
to
breed
vermin
and
ran
errands
for
the
workmen
no
all
he
heard
and
saw
from
the
older
workmen
and
his
companions
since
he
came
to
live
in
town
was
that
he
who
cheats
drinks
swears
who
gives
another
a
thrashing
who
goes
on
the
loose
is
a
fine
fellow
ill
his
constitution
undermined
by
unhealthy
labour
drink
and
debaucherybewildered
as
in
a
dream
knocking
aimlessly
about
town
he
gets
into
some
sort
of
a
shed
and
takes
from
there
some
old
mats
which
nobody
needsand
here
we
all
of
us
educated
people
rich
or
comfortably
off
meet
together
dressed
in
good
clothes
and
fine
uniforms
in
a
splendid
apartment
to
mock
this
unfortunate
brother
of
ours
whom
we
ourselves
have
ruined
terrible
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
the
cruelty
or
the
absurdity
is
greater
but
the
one
and
the
other
seem
to
reach
their
climax
nekhludoff
thought
all
this
no
longer
listening
to
what
was
going
on
and
he
was
horrorstruck
by
that
which
was
being
revealed
to
him
he
could
not
understand
why
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
all
this
before
and
why
others
were
unable
to
see
it

refuses
to
serve
during
an
interval
nekhludoff
got
up
and
went
out
into
the
corridor
with
the
intention
of
not
returning
to
the
court
let
them
do
what
they
liked
with
him
he
could
take
no
more
part
in
this
awful
and
horrid
tomfoolery
having
inquired
where
the
procureurs
cabinet
was
he
went
straight
to
him
the
attendant
did
not
wish
to
let
him
in
saying
that
the
procureur
was
busy
but
nekhludoff
paid
no
heed
and
went
to
the
door
where
he
was
met
by
an
official
he
asked
to
be
announced
to
the
procureur
saying
he
was
on
the
jury
and
had
a
very
important
communication
to
make
his
title
and
good
clothes
were
of
assistance
to
him
the
official
announced
him
to
the
procureur
and
nekhludoff
was
let
in
the
procureur
met
him
standing
evidently
annoyed
at
the
persistence
with
which
nekhludoff
demanded
admittance
what
is
it
you
want
the
procureur
asked
severely
i
am
on
the
jury
my
name
is
nekhludoff
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
me
to
see
the
prisoner
maslova
nekhludoff
said
quickly
and
resolutely
blushing
and
feeling
that
he
was
taking
a
step
which
would
have
a
decisive
influence
on
his
life
the
procureur
was
a
short
dark
man
with
short
grizzly
hair
quick
sparkling
eyes
and
a
thick
beard
cut
close
on
his
projecting
lower
jaw
maslova
yes
of
course
i
know
she
was
accused
of
poisoning
the
procureur
said
quietly
but
why
do
you
want
to
see
her
and
then
as
if
wishing
to
tone
down
his
question
he
added
i
cannot
give
you
the
permission
without
knowing
why
you
require
it
i
require
it
for
a
particularly
important
reason
yes
said
the
procureur
and
lifting
his
eyes
looked
attentively
at
nekhludoff
has
her
case
been
heard
or
not
she
was
tried
yesterday
and
unjustly
sentenced
she
is
innocent
yes
if
she
was
sentenced
only
yesterday
went
on
the
procureur
paying
no
attention
to
nekhludoffs
statement
concerning
maslovas
innocence
she
must
still
be
in
the
preliminary
detention
prison
until
the
sentence
is
delivered
in
its
final
form
visiting
is
allowed
there
only
on
certain
days
i
should
advise
you
to
inquire
there
but
i
must
see
her
as
soon
as
possible
nekhludoff
said
his
jaw
trembling
as
he
felt
the
decisive
moment
approaching
why
must
you
said
the
procureur
lifting
his
brows
with
some
agitation
because
i
betrayed
her
and
brought
her
to
the
condition
which
exposed
her
to
this
accusation
all
the
same
i
cannot
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
visiting
her
this
that
whether
i
succeed
or
not
in
getting
the
sentence
changed
i
want
to
follow
her
andmarry
her
said
nekhludoff
touched
to
tears
by
his
own
conduct
and
at
the
same
time
pleased
to
see
the
effect
he
produced
on
the
procureur
really
dear
me
said
the
procureur
this
is
certainly
a
very
exceptional
case
i
believe
you
are
a
member
of
the
krasnoporsk
rural
administration
he
asked
as
if
he
remembered
having
heard
before
of
this
nekhludoff
who
was
now
making
so
strange
a
declaration
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
do
not
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
my
request
answered
nekhludoff
flushing
angrily
certainly
not
said
the
procureur
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
and
not
in
the
least
abashed
only
your
wish
is
so
extraordinary
and
so
out
of
the
common
well
but
can
i
get
the
permission
the
permission
yes
i
will
give
you
an
order
of
admittance
directly
take
a
seat
he
went
up
to
the
table
sat
down
and
began
to
write
please
sit
down
nekhludoff
continued
to
stand
having
written
an
order
of
admittance
and
handed
it
to
nekhludoff
the
procureur
looked
curiously
at
him
i
must
also
state
that
i
can
no
longer
take
part
in
the
sessions
then
you
will
have
to
lay
valid
reasons
before
the
court
as
you
of
course
know
my
reasons
are
that
i
consider
all
judging
not
only
useless
but
immoral
yes
said
the
procureur
with
the
same
scarcely
perceptible
smile
as
if
to
show
that
this
kind
of
declaration
was
well
known
to
him
and
belonged
to
the
amusing
sort
yes
but
you
will
certainly
understand
that
i
as
procureur
can
not
agree
with
you
on
this
point
therefore
i
should
advise
you
to
apply
to
the
court
which
will
consider
your
declaration
and
find
it
valid
or
not
valid
and
in
the
latter
case
will
impose
a
fine
apply
then
to
the
court
i
have
made
my
declaration
and
shall
apply
nowhere
else
nekhludoff
said
angrily
well
then
goodafternoon
said
the
procureur
bowing
his
head
evidently
anxious
to
be
rid
of
this
strange
visitor
who
was
that
you
had
here
asked
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
as
he
entered
just
after
nekhludoff
left
the
room
nekhludoff
you
know
the
same
that
used
to
make
all
sorts
of
strange
statements
at
the
krasnoporsk
rural
meetings
just
fancy
he
is
on
the
jury
and
among
the
prisoners
there
is
a
woman
or
girl
sentenced
to
penal
servitude
whom
he
says
he
betrayed
and
now
he
wants
to
marry
her
you
dont
mean
to
say
so
thats
what
he
told
me
and
in
such
a
strange
state
of
excitement
there
is
something
abnormal
in
the
young
men
of
today
oh
but
he
is
not
so
very
young
yes
but
how
tiresome
your
famous
ivoshenka
was
he
carries
the
day
by
wearying
one
out
he
talked
and
talked
without
end
oh
that
kind
of
people
should
be
simply
stopped
or
they
will
become
real
obstructionists

nekhludoff
endeavours
to
visit
maslova
from
the
procureur
nekhludoff
went
straight
to
the
preliminary
detention
prison
however
no
maslova
was
to
be
found
there
and
the
inspector
explained
to
nekhludoff
that
she
would
probably
be
in
the
old
temporary
prison
nekhludoff
went
there
yes
katerina
maslova
was
there
the
distance
between
the
two
prisons
was
enormous
and
nekhludoff
only
reached
the
old
prison
towards
evening
he
was
going
up
to
the
door
of
the
large
gloomy
building
but
the
sentinel
stopped
him
and
rang
a
warder
came
in
answer
to
the
bell
nekhludoff
showed
him
his
order
of
admittance
but
the
warder
said
he
could
not
let
him
in
without
the
inspectors
permission
nekhludoff
went
to
see
the
inspector
as
he
was
going
up
the
stairs
he
heard
distant
sounds
of
some
complicated
bravura
played
on
the
piano
when
a
cross
servant
girl
with
a
bandaged
eye
opened
the
door
to
him
those
sounds
seemed
to
escape
from
the
room
and
to
strike
his
car
it
was
a
rhapsody
of
liszts
that
everybody
was
tired
of
splendidly
played
but
only
to
one
point
when
that
point
was
reached
the
same
thing
was
repeated
nekhludoff
asked
the
bandaged
maid
whether
the
inspector
was
in
she
answered
that
he
was
not
in
will
he
return
soon
the
rhapsody
again
stopped
and
recommenced
loudly
and
brilliantly
again
up
to
the
same
charmed
point
i
will
go
and
ask
and
the
servant
went
away
tell
him
he
is
not
in
and
wont
be
today
he
is
out
visiting
what
do
they
come
bothering
for
came
the
sound
of
a
womans
voice
from
behind
the
door
and
again
the
rhapsody
rattled
on
and
stopped
and
the
sound
of
a
chair
pushed
back
was
heard
it
was
plain
the
irritated
pianist
meant
to
rebuke
the
tiresome
visitor
who
had
come
at
an
untimely
hour

said
nekhludoff
without
answering
her
question
and
went
out
the
door
was
not
yet
closed
after
him
when
the
same
lively
tones
recommenced
in
the
courtyard
nekhludoff
met
an
officer
with
bristly
moustaches
and
asked
for
the
assistantinspector
it
was
the
assistant
himself
he
looked
at
the
order
of
admittance
but
said
that
he
could
not
decide
to
let
him
in
with
a
pass
for
the
preliminary
prison
besides
it
was
too
late
please
to
come
again
tomorrow
to
morrow
at
10
everybody
is
allowed
to
go
in
come
then
and
the
inspector
himself
will
be
at
home
then
you
can
have
the
interview
either
in
the
common
room
or
if
the
inspector
allows
it
in
the
office
and
so
nekhludoff
did
not
succeed
in
getting
an
interview
that
day
and
returned
home
as
he
went
along
the
streets
excited
at
the
idea
of
meeting
her
he
no
longer
thought
about
the
law
courts
but
recalled
his
conversations
with
the
procureur
and
the
inspectors
assistant
the
fact
that
he
had
been
seeking
an
interview
with
her
and
had
told
the
procureur
and
had
been
in
two
prisons
so
excited
him
that
it
was
long
before
he
could
calm
down
when
he
got
home
he
at
once
fetched
out
his
diary
that
had
long
remained
untouched
read
a
few
sentences
out
of
it
and
then
wrote
as
follows
for
two
years
i
have
not
written
anything
in
my
diary
and
thought
i
never
should
return
to
this
childishness
yet
it
is
not
childishness
but
converse
with
my
own
self
with
this
real
divine
self
which
lives
in
every
man
all
this
time
that
i
slept
there
was
no
one
for
me
to
converse
with
i
was
awakened
by
an
extraordinary
event
on
the
28th
of
april
in
the
law
court
when
i
was
on
the
jury
i
saw
her
in
the
prisoners
dock
the
katusha
betrayed
by
me
in
a
prisoners
cloak
condemned
to
penal
servitude
through
a
strange
mistake
and
my
own
fault
i
have
just
been
to
the
procureurs
and
to
the
prison
but
i
was
not
admitted
i
have
resolved
to
do
all
i
can
to
see
her
to
confess
to
her
and
to
atone
for
my
sin
even
by
a
marriage
god
help
me
my
soul
is
at
peace
and
i
am
full
of
joy
chapter
xxxvii
maslova
recalls
the
past
that
night
maslova
lay
awake
a
long
time
with
her
eyes
open
looking
at
the
door
in
front
of
which
the
deacons
daughter
kept
passing
she
was
thinking
that
nothing
would
induce
her
to
go
to
the
island
of
sakhalin
and
marry
a
convict
but
would
arrange
matters
somehow
with
one
of
the
prison
officials
the
secretary
a
warder
or
even
a
warders
assistant
arent
they
all
given
that
way
only
i
must
not
get
thin
or
else
i
am
lost
she
thought
of
how
the
advocate
had
looked
at
her
and
also
the
president
and
of
the
men
she
met
and
those
who
came
in
on
purpose
at
the
court
she
recollected
how
her
companion
bertha
who
came
to
see
her
in
prison
had
told
her
about
the
student
whom
she
had
loved
while
she
was
with
kitaeva
and
who
had
inquired
about
her
and
pitied
her
very
much
she
recalled
many
to
mind
only
not
nekhludoff
she
never
brought
back
to
mind
the
days
of
her
childhood
and
youth
and
her
love
to
nekhludoff
that
would
have
been
too
painful
these
memories
lay
untouched
somewhere
deep
in
her
soul
she
had
forgotten
him
and
never
recalled
and
never
even
dreamt
of
him
today
in
the
court
she
did
not
recognise
him
not
only
because
when
she
last
saw
him
he
was
in
uniform
without
a
beard
and
had
only
a
small
moustache
and
thick
curly
though
short
hair
and
now
was
bald
and
bearded
but
because
she
never
thought
about
him
she
had
buried
his
memory
on
that
terrible
dark
night
when
he
returning
from
the
army
had
passed
by
on
the
railway
without
stopping
to
call
on
his
aunts
katusha
then
knew
her
condition
up
to
that
night
she
did
not
consider
the
child
that
lay
beneath
her
heart
a
burden
but
on
that
night
everything
changed
and
the
child
became
nothing
but
a
weight
his
aunts
had
expected
nekhludoff
had
asked
him
to
come
and
see
them
in
passing
but
he
had
telegraphed
that
he
could
not
come
as
he
had
to
be
in
petersburg
at
an
appointed
time
when
katusha
heard
this
she
made
up
her
mind
to
go
to
the
station
and
see
him
the
train
was
to
pass
by
at
two
oclock
in
the
night
katusha
having
helped
the
old
ladies
to
bed
and
persuaded
a
little
girl
the
cooks
daughter
mashka
to
come
with
her
put
on
a
pair
of
old
boots
threw
a
shawl
over
her
head
gathered
up
her
dress
and
ran
to
the
station
it
was
a
warm
rainy
and
windy
autumn
night
the
rain
now
pelted
down
in
warm
heavy
drops
now
stopped
again
it
was
too
dark
to
see
the
path
across
the
field
and
in
the
wood
it
was
pitch
black
so
that
although
katusha
knew
the
way
well
she
got
off
the
path
and
got
to
the
little
station
where
the
train
stopped
for
three
minutes
not
before
as
she
had
hoped
but
after
the
second
bell
had
been
rung
hurrying
up
the
platform
katusha
saw
him
at
once
at
the
windows
of
a
firstclass
carriage
two
officers
sat
opposite
each
other
on
the
velvetcovered
seats
playing
cards
this
carriage
was
very
brightly
lit
up
on
the
little
table
between
the
seats
stood
two
thick
dripping
candles
he
sat
in
his
closefitting
breeches
on
the
arm
of
the
seat
leaning
against
the
back
and
laughed
as
soon
as
she
recognised
him
she
knocked
at
the
carriage
window
with
her
benumbed
hand
but
at
that
moment
the
last
bell
rang
and
the
train
first
gave
a
backward
jerk
and
then
gradually
the
carriages
began
to
move
forward
one
of
the
players
rose
with
the
cards
in
his
hand
and
looked
out
she
knocked
again
and
pressed
her
face
to
the
window
but
the
carriage
moved
on
and
she
went
alongside
looking
in
the
officer
tried
to
lower
the
window
but
could
not
nekhludoff
pushed
him
aside
and
began
lowering
it
himself
the
train
went
faster
so
that
she
had
to
walk
quickly
the
train
went
on
still
faster
and
the
window
opened
the
guard
pushed
her
aside
and
jumped
in
katusha
ran
on
along
the
wet
boards
of
the
platform
and
when
she
came
to
the
end
she
could
hardly
stop
herself
from
falling
as
she
ran
down
the
steps
of
the
platform
she
was
running
by
the
side
of
the
railway
though
the
firstclass
carriage
had
long
passed
her
and
the
secondclass
carriages
were
gliding
by
faster
and
at
last
the
thirdclass
carriages
still
faster
but
she
ran
on
and
when
the
last
carriage
with
the
lamps
at
the
back
had
gone
by
she
had
already
reached
the
tank
which
fed
the
engines
and
was
unsheltered
from
the
wind
which
was
blowing
her
shawl
about
and
making
her
skirt
cling
round
her
legs
the
shawl
flew
off
her
head
but
still
she
ran
on
katerina
michaelovna
youve
lost
your
shawl
screamed
the
little
girl
who
was
trying
to
keep
up
with
her
katusha
stopped
threw
back
her
head
and
catching
hold
of
it
with
both
hands
sobbed
aloud
gone
she
screamed
he
is
sitting
in
a
velvet
armchair
and
joking
and
drinking
in
a
brightly
lit
carriage
and
i
out
here
in
the
mud
in
the
darkness
in
the
wind
and
the
rain
am
standing
and
weeping
she
thought
to
herself
and
sat
down
on
the
ground
sobbing
so
loud
that
the
little
girl
got
frightened
and
put
her
arms
round
her
wet
as
she
was
come
home
dear
she
said
when
a
train
passesthen
under
a
carriage
and
there
will
be
an
end
katusha
was
thinking
without
heeding
the
girl
and
she
made
up
her
mind
to
do
it
when
as
it
always
happens
when
a
moment
of
quiet
follows
great
excitement
he
the
childhis
childmade
himself
known
within
her
suddenly
all
that
a
moment
before
had
been
tormenting
her
so
that
it
had
seemed
impossible
to
live
all
her
bitterness
towards
him
and
the
wish
to
revenge
herself
even
by
dying
passed
away
she
grew
quieter
got
up
put
the
shawl
on
her
head
and
went
home
wet
muddy
and
quite
exhausted
she
returned
and
from
that
day
the
change
which
brought
her
where
she
now
was
began
to
operate
in
her
soul
beginning
from
that
dreadful
night
she
ceased
believing
in
god
and
in
goodness
she
had
herself
believed
in
god
and
believed
that
other
people
also
believed
in
him
but
after
that
night
she
became
convinced
that
no
one
believed
and
that
all
that
was
said
about
god
and
his
laws
was
deception
and
untruth
he
whom
she
loved
and
who
had
loved
heryes
she
knew
thathad
thrown
her
away
had
abused
her
love
yet
he
was
the
best
of
all
the
people
she
knew
all
the
rest
were
still
worse
all
that
afterwards
happened
to
her
strengthened
her
in
this
belief
at
every
step
his
aunts
the
pious
old
ladies
turned
her
out
when
she
could
no
longer
serve
them
as
she
used
to
and
of
all
those
she
met
the
women
used
her
as
a
means
of
getting
money
the
men
from
the
old
police
officer
down
to
the
warders
of
the
prison
looked
at
her
as
on
an
object
for
pleasure
and
no
one
in
the
world
cared
for
aught
but
pleasure
in
this
belief
the
old
author
with
whom
she
had
come
together
in
the
second
year
of
her
life
of
independence
had
strengthened
her
he
had
told
her
outright
that
it
was
this
that
constituted
the
happiness
of
life
and
he
called
it
poetical
and
aesthetic
everybody
lived
for
himself
only
for
his
pleasure
and
all
the
talk
concerning
god
and
righteousness
was
deception
and
if
sometimes
doubts
arose
in
her
mind
and
she
wondered
why
everything
was
so
illarranged
in
the
world
that
all
hurt
each
other
and
made
each
other
suffer
she
thought
it
best
not
to
dwell
on
it
and
if
she
felt
melancholy
she
could
smoke
or
better
still
drink
and
it
would
pass

for
mass
on
sunday
morning
at
five
oclock
when
a
whistle
sounded
in
the
corridor
of
the
womens
ward
of
the
prison
korableva
who
was
already
awake
called

oh
dear
life
again
thought
maslova
with
horror
involuntarily
breathing
in
the
air
that
had
become
terribly
noisome
towards
the
morning
she
wished
to
fall
asleep
again
to
enter
into
the
region
of
oblivion
but
the
habit
of
fear
overcame
sleepiness
and
she
sat
up
and
looked
round
drawing
her
feet
under
her
the
women
had
all
got
up
only
the
elder
children
were
still
asleep
the

was
carefully
drawing
a

from
under
the

so
as
not
to
wake
them
the
watchmans
wife
was
hanging
up
the
rags
to
dry
that
served
the
baby
as
swaddling

while
the

was
screaming
desperately
in

was
trying
to
quiet
it
the
consumptive
woman
was
coughing
with
her
hands
pressed
to
her
chest
while
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
and
she
sighed
loudly
almost
screaming
in
the
intervals
of
coughing
the
fat
redhaired
woman
was
lying
on
her
back
with
knees
drawn
up
and
loudly
relating
a
dream
the
old
woman
accused
of
incendiarism
was
standing
in
front
of
the
image
crossing
herself
and
bowing
and
repeating
the
same
words
over
and
over
again
the
deacons
daughter
sat
on
the
bedstead
looking
before
her
with
a
dull
sleepy
face
khoroshavka
was
twisting
her
black
oily
coarse
hair
round
her
fingers
the
sound
of
slipshod
feet
was
heard
in
the
passage
and
the
door
opened
to
let
in
two
convicts
dressed
in
jackets
and
grey
trousers
that
did
not
reach
to
their
ankles
with
serious
cross
faces
they
lifted
the
stinking
tub
and
carried
it
out
of
the
cell
the
women
went
out
to
the
taps
in
the
corridor
to
wash
there
the
redhaired
woman
again
began
a
quarrel
with
a
woman
from
another
cell
is
it
the
solitary
cell
you
want
shouted
an
old
jailer
slapping
the
redhaired
woman
on
her
bare
fat
back
so
that
it
sounded
through
the
corridor
you
be
quiet
lawks
the
old
ones
playful
said
the
woman
taking
his
action
for
a
caress
now
then
be
quick
get
ready
for
the
mass
maslova
had
hardly
time
to
do
her
hair
and
dress
when
the
inspector
came
with
his
assistants
come
out
for
inspection
cried
a
jailer
some
more
prisoners
came
out
of
other
cells
and
stood
in
two
rows
along
the
corridor
each
woman
had
to
place
her
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
woman
in
front
of
her
they
were
all
counted
after
the
inspection
the
woman
warder
led
the
prisoners
to
church
maslova
and
theodosia
were
in
the
middle
of
a
column
of
over
a
hundred
women
who
had
come
out
of
different
cells
all
were
dressed
in
white
skirts
white
jackets
and
wore
white
kerchiefs
on
their
heads
except
a
few
who
had
their
own
coloured
clothes
on
these
were
wives
who
with
their
children
were
following
their
convict
husbands
to
siberia
the
whole
flight
of
stairs
was
filled
by
the
procession
the
patter
of
softlyshod
feet
mingled
with
the
voices
and
now
and
then
a
laugh
when
turning
on
the
landing
maslova
saw
her
enemy
botchkova
in
front
and
pointed
out
her
angry
face
to
theodosia
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
the
women
stopped
talking
bowing
and
crossing
themselves
they
entered
the
empty
church
which
glistened
with
gilding
crowding
and
pushing
one
another
they
took
their
places
on
the
right
after
the
women
came
the
men
condemned
to
banishment
those
serving
their
term
in
the
prison
and
those
exiled
by
their
communes
and
coughing
loudly
they
took
their
stand
crowding
the
left
side
and
the
middle
of
the
church
on
one
side
of
the
gallery
above
stood
the
men
sentenced
to
penal
servitude
in
siberia
who
had
been
let
into
the
church
before
the
others
each
of
them
had
half
his
head
shaved
and
their
presence
was
indicated
by
the
clanking
of
the
chains
on
their
feet
on
the
other
side
of
the
gallery
stood
those
in
preliminary
confinement
without
chains
their
heads
not
shaved
the
prison
church
had
been
rebuilt
and
ornamented
by
a
rich
merchant
who
spent
several
tens
of
thousands
of
roubles
on
it
and
it
glittered
with
gay
colours
and
gold
for
a
time
there
was
silence
in
the
church
and
only
coughing
blowing
of
noses
the
crying
of
babies
and
now
and
then
the
rattling
of
chains
was
heard
but
at
last
the
convicts
that
stood
in
the
middle
moved
pressed
against
each
other
leaving
a
passage
in
the
centre
of
the
church
down
which
the
prison
inspector
passed
to
take
his
place
in
front
of
every
one
in
the
nave
chapter

the
prison
churchblind
leaders
of
the
blind
the
service
began
it
consisted
of
the
following
the
priest
having
dressed
in
a
strange
and
very
inconvenient
garb
made
of
gold
cloth
cut
and
arranged
little
bits
of
bread
on
a
saucer
and
then
put
them
into
a
cup
with
wine
repeating
at
the
same
time
different
names
and
prayers
meanwhile
the
deacon
first
read
slavonic
prayers
difficult
to
understand
in
themselves
and
rendered
still
more
incomprehensible
by
being
read
very
fast
and
then
sang
them
turn
and
turn
about
with
the
convicts
the
contents
of
the
prayers
were
chiefly
the
desire
for
the
welfare
of
the
emperor
and
his
family
these
petitions
were
repeated
many
times
separately
and
together
with
other
prayers
the
people
kneeling
besides
this
several
verses
from
the
acts
of
the
apostles
were
read
by
the
deacon
in
a
peculiarly
strained
voice
which
made
it
impossible
to
understand
what
he
read
and
then
the
priest
read
very
distinctly
a
part
of
the
gospel
according
to
st
mark
in
which
it
said
that
christ
having
risen
from
the
dead
before
flying
up
to
heaven
to
sit
down
at
his
fathers
right
hand
first
showed
himself
to
mary
magdalene
out
of
whom
he
had
driven
seven
devils
and
then
to
eleven
of
his
disciples
and
ordered
them
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
whole
creation
and
the
priest
added
that
if
any
one
did
not
believe
this
he
would
perish
but
he
that
believed
it
and
was
baptised
should
be
saved
and
should
besides
drive
out
devils
and
cure
people
by
laying
his
hands
on
them
should
talk
in
strange
tongues
should
take
up
serpents
and
if
he
drank
poison
should
not
die
but
remain
well
the
essence
of
the
service
consisted
in
the
supposition
that
the
bits
cut
up
by
the
priest
and
put
by
him
into
the
wine
when
manipulated
and
prayed
over
in
a
certain
way
turned
into
the
flesh
and
blood
of
god
these
manipulations
consisted
in
the
priests
regularly
lifting
and
holding
up
his
arms
though
hampered
by
the
gold
cloth
sack
he
had
on
then
sinking
on
to
his
knees
and
kissing
the
table
and
all
that
was
on
it
but
chiefly
in
his
taking
a
cloth
by
two
of
its
corners
and
waving
it
regularly
and
softly
over
the
silver
saucer
and
golden
cup
it
was
supposed
that
at
this
point
the
bread
and
the
wine
turned
into
flesh
and
blood
therefore
this
part
of
the
service
was
performed
with
the
greatest
solemnity
now
to
the
blessed
most
pure
and
most
holy
mother
of
god
the
priest
cried
from
the
golden
partition
which
divided
part
of
the
church
from
the
rest
and
the
choir
began
solemnly
to
sing
that
it
was
very
right
to
glorify
the
virgin
mary
who
had
borne
christ
without
losing
her
virginity
and
was
therefore
worthy
of
greater
honour
than
some
kind
of
cherubim
and
greater
glory
than
some
kind
of
seraphim
after
this
the
transformation
was
considered
accomplished
and
the
priest
having
taken
the
napkin
off
the
saucer
cut
the
middle
bit
of
bread
in
four
and
put
it
into
the
wine
and
then
into
his
mouth
he
was
supposed
to
have
eaten
a
bit
of
gods
flesh
and
swallowed
a
little
of
his
blood
then
the
priest
drew
a
curtain
opened
the
middle
door
in
the
partition
and
taking
the
gold
cup
in
his
hands
came
out
of
the
door
inviting
those
who
wished
to
do
so
also
to
come
and
eat
some
of
gods
flesh
and
blood
that
was
contained
in
the
cup
a
few
children
appeared
to
wish
to
do
so
after
having
asked
the
children
their
names
the
priest
carefully
took
out
of
the
cup
with
a
spoon
and
shoved
a
bit
of
bread
soaked
in
wine
deep
into
the
mouth
of
each
child
in
turn
and
the
deacon
while
wiping
the
childrens
mouths
sang
in
a
merry
voice
that
the
children
were
eating
the
flesh
and
drinking
the
blood
of
god
after
this
the
priest
carried
the
cup
back
behind
the
partition
and
there
drank
all
the
remaining
blood
and
ate
up
all
the
bits
of
flesh
and
after
having
carefully
sucked
his
moustaches
and
wiped
his
mouth
he
stepped
briskly
from
behind
the
partition
the
soles
of
his
calfskin
boots
creaking
the
principal
part
of
this
christian
service
was
now
finished
but
the
priest
wishing
to
comfort
the
unfortunate
prisoners
added
to
the
ordinary
service
another
this
consisted
of
his
going
up
to
the
gilt
hammeredout
image
with
black
face
and
hands
supposed
to
represent
the
very
god
he
had
been
eating
illuminated
by
a
dozen
wax
candles
and
proceeding
in
a
strange
discordant
voice
to
hum
or
sing
the
following
words

jesu

then
he
stopped
drew
breath
crossed
himself
bowed
to
the
ground
and
every

did
the
samethe

and
from
above
the
clinking
of

every

he
repeated
the
word

his
voice
became
more
and
more
wheezy
at
last
he
came
to
a
stop
and
holding
up
his
silklined
cassock
and
kneeling
down
on
one
knee
he
stooped
down
to
the
ground
and
the
choir
began
to
sing
repeating
the
words
jesu
son
of
god
have
mercy
on
me
and
the
convicts
fell
down
and
rose
again
shaking
back
the
hair
that
was
left
on
their
heads
and
rattling
with
the
chains
that
were
bruising
their
thin
ankles
this
continued
for
a
long
time
first
came
the
glorification
which
ended
with
the
words
have
mercy
on
me
then
more
glorifications
ending
with
alleluia
and
the
convicts
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
bowed
first
at
each
sentence
then
after
every
two
and
then
after
three
and
all
were
very
glad
when
the
glorification
ended
and
the
priest
shut
the
book
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
retired
behind
the
partition
one
last
act
remained
the
priest
took
a
large
gilt
cross
with
enamel
medallions
at
the
ends
from
a
table
and
came
out
into
the
centre
of
the
church
with
it
first
the
inspector
came
up
and
kissed
the
cross
then
the
jailers
then
the
convicts
pushing
and
abusing
each
other
in
whispers
the
priest
talking
to
the
inspector
pushed
the
cross
and
his
hand
now
against
the
mouths
and
now
against
the
noses
of
the
convicts
who
were
trying
to
kiss
both
the
cross
and
the
hand
of
the
priest
and
thus
ended
the
christian
service
intended
for
the
comfort
and
the

the
husks
of
religion
and
none
of
those
present
from
the
inspector
down
to
maslova
seemed
conscious
of
the
fact
that
this
jesus
whose
name
the
priest
repeated
such
a
great
number
of
times
and
whom
he
praised
with
all
these
curious
expressions
had
forbidden
the
very
things
that
were
being
done
there
that
he
had
prohibited
not
only
this
meaningless
muchspeaking
and
the
blasphemous
incantation
over
the
bread
and
wine
but
had
also
in
the
clearest
words
forbidden
men
to
call
other
men
their
master
and
to
pray
in
temples

had
ordered
that
every
one
should
pray
in
solitude
had
forbidden
to
erect
temples
saying
that
he
had
come
to
destroy
them
and
that
one
should
worship
not
in
a
temple
but
in
spirit
and
in
truth
and
above
all
that
he
had
forbidden
not
only
to
judge
to
imprison
to
torment
to
execute
men
as
was
being
done
here
but
had
prohibited
any
kind
of
violence
saying
that
he
had
come
to
give
freedom
to
the
captives
no
one
present
seemed
conscious
that
all
that
was
going
on
here
was
the
greatest
blasphemy
and
a
supreme
mockery
of
that
same
christ
in
whose
name
it
was
being
done
no
one
seemed
to
realise
that
the
gilt
cross
with
the
enamel
medallions
at
the
ends
which
the
priest
held
out
to
the
people
to
be
kissed
was
nothing
but
the
emblem
of
that
gallows
on
which
christ
had
been
executed
for
denouncing
just
what
was
going
on
here
that
these
priests
who
imagined
they
were
eating
and
drinking
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
in
the
form
of
bread
and
wine
did
in
reality
eat
and
drink
his
flesh
and
his
blood
but
not
as
wine
and
bits
of
bread
but
by
ensnaring
these
little
ones
with
whom
he
identified
himself
by
depriving
them
of
the
greatest
blessings
and
submitting
them
to
most
cruel
torments
and
by
hiding
from
men
the
tidings
of
great
joy
which
he
had
brought
that
thought
did
not
enter
into
the
mind
of
any
one
present
the
priest
did
his
part
with
a
quiet
conscience
because
he
was
brought
up
from
childhood
to
consider
that
the
only
true
faith
was
the
faith
which
had
been
held
by
all
the
holy
men
of
olden
times
and
was
still
held
by
the
church
and
demanded
by
the
state
authorities
he
did
not
believe
that
the
bread
turned
into
flesh
that
it
was
useful
for
the
soul
to
repeat
so
many
words
or
that
he
had
actually
swallowed
a
bit
of
god
no
one
could
believe
this
but
he
believed
that
one
ought
to
hold
this
faith
what
strengthened
him
most
in
this
faith
was
the
fact
that
for
fulfilling
the
demands
of
this
faith
he
had
for
the
last
15
years
been
able
to
draw
an
income
which
enabled
him
to
keep
his
family
send
his
son
to
a
gymnasium
and
his
daughter
to
a
school
for
the
daughters
of
the
clergy
the
deacon
believed
in
the
same
manner
and
even
more
firmly
than
the
priest
for
he
had
forgotten
the
substance
of
the
dogmas
of
this
faith
and
knew
only
that
the
prayers
for
the
dead
the
masses
with
and
without
the
acathistus
all
had
a
definite
price
which
real
christians
readily
paid
and
therefore
he
called
out
his
have
mercy
have
mercy
very
willingly
and
read
and
said
what
was
appointed
with
the
same
quiet
certainty
of
its
being
necessary
to
do
so
with
which
other
men
sell
faggots
flour
or
potatoes
the
prison
inspector
and
the
warders
though
they
had
never
understood
or
gone
into
the
meaning
of
these
dogmas
and
of
all
that
went
on
in
church
believed
that
they
must
believe
because
the
higher
authorities
and
the
tsar
himself
believed
in
it
besides
though
faintly
and
themselves
unable
to
explain
why
they
felt
that
this
faith
defended
their
cruel
occupations
if
this
faith
did
not
exist
it
would
have
been
more
difficult
perhaps
impossible
for
them
to
use
all
their
powers
to
torment
people
as
they
were
now
doing
with
a
quiet
conscience
the
inspector
was
such
a
kindhearted
man
that
he
could
not
have
lived
as
he
was
now
living
unsupported
by
his
faith
therefore
he
stood
motionless
bowed
and
crossed
himself
zealously
tried
to
feel
touched
when
the
song
about
the
cherubims
was
being
sung
and
when
the
children
received
communion
he
lifted
one
of
them
and
held
him
up
to
the
priest
with
his
own
hands
the
great
majority
of
the
prisoners
believed
that
there
lay
a
mystic
power
in
these
gilt
images
these
vestments
candles
cups
crosses
and
this
repetition
of
incomprehensible
words
jesu
sweetest
and
have
mercya
power
through
which
might
be
obtained
much
convenience
in
this
and
in
the
future
life
only
a
few
clearly
saw
the
deception
that
was
practised
on
the
people
who
adhered
to
this
faith
and
laughed
at
it
in
their
hearts
but
the
majority
having
made
several
attempts
to
get
the
conveniences
they
desired
by
means
of
prayers
masses
and
candles
and
not
having
got
them
their
prayers
remaining
unanswered
were
each
of
them
convinced
that
their
want
of
success
was
accidental
and
that
this
organisation
approved
by
the
educated
and
by
archbishops
is
very
important
and
necessary
if
not
for
this
at
any
rate
for
the
next
life
maslova
also
believed
in
this
way
she
felt
like
the
rest
a
mixed
sensation
of
piety
and
dulness
she
stood
at
first
in
a
crowd
behind
a
railing
so
that
she
could
see
no
one
but
her
companions
but
when
those
to
receive
communion
moved
on
she
and
theodosia
stepped
to
the
front
and
they
saw
the
inspector
and
behind
him
standing
among
the
warders
a
little
peasant
with
a
very
light
beard
and
fair
hair
this
was
theodosias
husband
and
he
was
gazing
with
fixed
eyes
at
his
wife
during
the
acathistus
maslova
occupied
herself
in
scrutinising
him
and
talking
to
theodosia
in
whispers
and
bowed
and
made
the
sign
of

to

on

a
dense

was
surging
along
the
row
of
booths
and
tattered
men
walked
about
selling

with
the
pealing

of

that
were
calling

to

to

turning
that
led
to
the
prison
several
personsmen
and
womenmost
of
them
carrying
small
bundles
stood
at
this
turning
about
100
steps
from
the
prison
to
the
right
there
were
several
low
wooden
buildings
to
the
left
a
twostoreyed
house
with
a
signboard
the
huge
brick
building
the
prison
proper
was
just
in
front
and
the
visitors
were
not
allowed
to
come
up
to
it
a
sentinel
was
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
it
and
shouted
at
any
one
who
tried
to
pass
him
at
the
gate
of
the
wooden
buildings
to
the
right
opposite
the
sentinel
sat
a
warder
on
a
bench
dressed
in
uniform
with
gold
cords
a
notebook
in
his
hands
the
visitors
came
up
to
him
and
named
the
persons
they
wanted
to
see
and
he
put
the
names
down
nekhludoff
also
went
up
and
named

the
warder
wrote
down
the
name
whydont
they
admit

yet
asked

the
service
is
going
on
when
the
mass
is
over
youll
be
admitted
nekhludoff
stepped
aside
from
the
waiting
crowd
a
man
in
tattered
clothes
crumpled
hat
with
bare
feet
and
red
stripes
all
over
his
face
detached
himself
from
the
crowd
and
turned
towards
the
prison
now
then
where
are
you
going
shouted
the
sentinel
with
the
gun
and
you
hold
your
row
answered
the
tramp
not
in
the
least
abashed
by
the
sentinels
words
and
turned
back
well
if
youll
not
let
me
in
ill
wait
but
no
must
needs
shout
as
if
he
were
a
general
the
crowd
laughed
approvingly
the
visitors
were
for
the
greater
part
badlydressed
people
some
were
ragged
but
there
were
also
some
respectablelooking
men
and
women
next
to
nekhludoff
stood
a
cleanshaven
stout
and
redcheeked
man
holding
a
bundle
apparently
containing
undergarments
this
was
the
doorkeeper
of
a
bank
he
had
come
to
see
his
brother
who
was
arrested
for
forgery
the
goodnatured
fellow
told
nekhludoff
the
whole
story
of
his
life
and
was
going
to
question
him
in
turn
when
their
attention
was
aroused
by
a
student
and
a
veiled
lady
who
drove
up
in
a
trap
with
rubber
tyres
drawn
by
a
large
thoroughbred
horse
the
student
was
holding
a
large
bundle
he
came
up
to
nekhludoff
and
asked
if
and
how
he
could
give
the
rolls
he
had
brought
in
alms
to
the
prisoners
his
fiancee
wished
it
this
lady
was
his
fiancee
and
her
parents
had
advised
them
to
take
some
rolls
to
the
prisoners
i
myself
am
here
for
the
first
time
said
nekhludoff
and
dont
know
but
i
think
you
had
better
ask
this
man
and
he
pointed
to
the
warder
with
the
gold
cords
and
the
book
sitting
on
the
right
as
they
were
speaking
the
large
iron
door
with
a
window
in
it
opened
and
an
officer
in
uniform
followed
by
another
warder
stepped
out
the
warder
with
the
notebook
proclaimed
that
the
admittance
of
visitors
would
now
commence
the
sentinel
stepped
aside
and
all
the
visitors
rushed
to
the
door
as
if
afraid
of
being
too
late
some
even
ran
at
the
door
there
stood
a
warder
who
counted
the
visitors
as
they
came
in
saying
aloud
16
17
and
so
on
another
warder
stood
inside
the
building
and
also
counted
the
visitors
as
they
entered
a
second
door
touching
each
one
with
his
hand
so
that
when
they
went
away
again
not
one
visitor
should
be
able
to
remain
inside
the
prison
and
not
one
prisoner
might
get
out
the
warder
without
looking
at
whom
he
was
touching
slapped
nekhludoff
on
the
back
and
nekhludoff
felt
hurt
by
the
touch
of
the
warders
hand
but
remembering
what
he
had
come
about
he
felt
ashamed
of
feeling
dissatisfied
and
taking
offence
the
first
apartment
behind
the
entrance
doors
was
a
large
vaulted
room
with
iron
bars
to
the
small
windows
in
this
room
which
was
called
the
meetingroom
nekhludoff
was
startled
by
the
sight
of
a
large
picture
of
the
crucifixion
whats
that
for
he
thought
his
mind
involuntarily
connecting
the
subject
of
the
picture
with
liberation
and
not
with
imprisonment
he
went
on
slowly
letting
the
hurrying
visitors
pass
before
and
experiencing
a
mingled
feeling
of
horror
at
the
evildoers
locked
up
in
this
building
compassion
for
those
who
like
katusha
and
the
boy
they
tried
the
day
before
must
be
here
though
guiltless
and
shyness
and
tender
emotion
at
the
thought
of
the
interview
before
him
the
warder
at
the
other
end
of
the
meetingroom
said
something
as
they
passed
but
nekhludoff
absorbed
by
his
own
thoughts
paid
no
attention
to
him
and
continued
to
follow
the
majority
of
the
visitors
and
so
got
into
the
mens
part
of
the
prison
instead
of
the
womens
letting
the
hurrying
visitors
pass
before
him
he
was
the
last
to
get
into
the
interviewingroom
as
soon
as
nekhludoff
opened
the
door
of
this
room
he
was
struck
by
the
deafening
roar
of
a
hundred
voices
shouting
at
once
the
reason
of
which
he
did
not
at
once
understand
but
when
he
came
nearer
to
the
people
he
saw
that
they
were
all
pressing
against
a
net
that
divided
the
room
in
two
like
flies
settling
on
sugar
and
he
understood
what
it
meant
the
two
halves
of
the
room
the
windows
of
which
were
opposite
the
door
he
had
come
in
by
were
separated
not
by
one
but
by
two
nets
reaching
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
the
wire
nets
were
stretched
7
feet
apart
and
soldiers
were
walking
up
and
down
the
space
between
them
on
the
further
side
of
the
nets
were
the
prisoners
on
the
nearer
the
visitors
between
them
was
a
double
row
of
nets
and
a
space
of
7
feet
wide
so
that
they
could
not
hand
anything
to
one
another
and
any
one
whose
sight
was
not
very
good
could
not
even
distinguish
the
face
on
the
other
side
it
was
also
difficult
to
talk
one
had
to
scream
in
order
to
be
heard
on
both
sides
were
faces
pressed
close
to
the
nets
faces
of
wives
husbands
fathers
mothers
children
trying
to
see
each
others
features
and
to
say
what
was
necessary
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
understood
but
as
each
one
tried
to
be
heard
by
the
one
he
was
talking
to
and
his
neighbour
tried
to
do
the
same
they
did
their
best
to
drown
each
others
voices
and
that
was
the
cause
of
the
din
and
shouting
which
struck
nekhludoff
when
he
first
came
in
it
was
impossible
to
understand
what
was
being
said
and
what
were
the
relations
between
the
different
people
next
nekhludoff
an
old
woman
with
a
kerchief
on
her
head
stood
trembling
her
chin
pressed
close
to
the
net
and
shouting
something
to
a
young
fellow
half
of
whose
head
was
shaved
who
listened
attentively
with
raised
brows
by
the
side
of
the
old
woman
was
a
young
man
in
a
peasants
coat
who
listened
shaking
his
head
to
a
boy
very
like
himself
next
stood
a
man
in
rags
who
shouted
waving
his
arm
and
laughing
next
to
him
a
woman
with
a
good
woollen
shawl
on
her
shoulders
sat
on
the
floor
holding
a
baby
in
her
lap
and
crying
bitterly
this
was
apparently
the
first
time
she
saw
the
greyheaded
man
on
the
other
side
in
prison
clothes
and
with
his
head
shaved
beyond
her
was
the
doorkeeper
who
had
spoken
to
nekhludoff
outside
he
was
shouting
with
all
his
might
to
a
greyhaired
convict
on
the
other
side
when
nekhludoff
found
that
he
would
have
to
speak
in
similar
conditions
a
feeling
of
indignation
against
those
who
were
able
to
make
and
enforce
these
conditions
arose
in
him
he
was
surprised
that
placed
in
such
a
dreadful
position
no
one
seemed
offended
at
this
outrage
on
human
feelings
the
soldiers
the
inspector
the
prisoners
themselves
acted
as
if
acknowledging
all
this
to
be
necessary
nekhludoff
remained
in
this
room
for
about
five
minutes
feeling
strangely
depressed
conscious
of
how
powerless
he
was
and
at
variance
with
all
the
world
he
was
seized
with
a
curious
moral
sensation
like
seasickness

but
i
must
do
what
i
came
here
for
he
said
trying
to
pick
up
courage
what
is
to
be
done
now
he
looked
round
for
an
official
and
seeing
a
thin
little
man
in
the
uniform
of
an
officer
going
up
and
down
behind
the
people
he
approached
him
can
you
tell
me
sir
he
said
with
exceedingly
strained
politeness
of
manner
where
the
women
are
kept
and
where
one
is
allowed
to
interview

with

politeness
you
should
have
said
so
when
you
were
in

that
you

answered
nekhludoff
fearing
to
spoil
the
inspectors
good
humour
which
seemed
to
incline
in
his
favour
if
you
want
to
go
to
the
womens
ward
please
to
step
this
way
said
the
officer
having
decided
from
nekhludoffs
appearance
that
he
was
worthy
of
attention

he
said
turning
to
a
moustached
corporal
with
medals
on
his
breast
yes
sir
at
this
moment
heartrending
sobs
were
heard
coming
from
some
one
near
the
net
everything
here
seemed
strange
to
nekhludoff
but
strangest
of
all
was
that
he
should
have
to
thank
and
feel
obligation
towards
the
inspector
and
the
chief
warders
the
very
men
who
were
performing
the
cruel
deeds
that
were
done
in
this
house
the
corporal
showed
nekhludoff
through
the
corridor
out
of
the
mens
into
the
womens
interviewingroom
this
room
like
that
of
the
men
was
divided
by
two
wire
nets
but
it
was
much
smaller
and
there
were
fewer
visitors
and
fewer
prisoners
so
that
there
was
less
shouting
than
in
the
mens
room
yet
the
same
thing
was
going
on
here
only
between
the
nets
instead
of
soldiers
there
was
a
woman
warder
dressed
in
a
blueedged
uniform
jacket
with
gold
cords
on
the
sleeves
and
a
blue
belt
here
also
as
in
the
mens
room
the
people
were
pressing
close
to
the
wire
netting
on
both
sides
on
the
nearer
side
the
townspeople
in
varied
attire
on
the
further
side
the
prisoners
some
in
white
prison
clothes
others
in
their
own
coloured
dresses
the
whole
length
of
the
net
was
taken
up
by
the
people
standing
close
to
it
some
rose
on
tiptoe
to
be
heard
across
the
heads
of
others
some
sat
talking
on
the
floor
the
most
remarkable
of
the
prisoners
both
by
her
piercing
screams
and
her
appearance
was
a
thin
dishevelled
gipsy
her
kerchief
had
slipped
off
her
curly
hair
and
she
stood
near
a
post
in
the
middle
of
the
prisoners
division
shouting
something
accompanied
by
quick
gestures
to
a
gipsy
man
in
a
blue
coat
girdled
tightly
below
the
waist
next
the
gipsy
man
a
soldier
sat
on
the
ground
talking
to
prisoner
next
the
soldier
leaning
close
to
the
net
stood
a
young
peasant
with
a
fair
beard
and
a
flushed
face
keeping
back
his
tears
with
difficulty
a
pretty
fairhaired
prisoner
with
bright
blue
eyes
was
speaking
to
him
these
two
were
theodosia
and
her
husband
next
to
them
was
a
tramp
talking
to
a
broadfaced
woman
then
two
women
then
a
man
then
again
a
woman
and
in
front
of
each
a
prisoner
maslova
was
not
among
them
but
some
one
stood
by
the
window
behind
the
prisoners
and
nekhludoff
knew
it
was
she
his
heart
began
to
beat
faster
and
his
breath
stopped
the
decisive
moment
was
approaching
he
went
up
to
the
part
of
the
net
where
he
could
see
the
prisoner
and
recognised
her
at
once
she
stood
behind
the
blueeyed
theodosia
and
smiled
listening
to
what
theodosia
was
saying
she
did
not
wear
the
prison
cloak
now
but
a
white
dress
tightly
drawn
in
at
the
waist
by
a
belt
and
very
full
in
the
bosom
from
under
her
kerchief
appeared
the
black
ringlets
of
her
fringe
just
the
same
as
in
the
court
now
in
a
moment
it
will
be
decided
he
thought
how
shall
i
call
her
or
will
she
come
herself
she
was
expecting
bertha
that
this
man
had
come
to
see
her
never
entered
her
head
whom
do
you
want
said
the
warder
who
was
walking
between
the
nets
coming
up
to
nekhludoff
katerina
maslova
nekhludoff
uttered
with
difficulty
katerina

some
one
to
see

maslova
looked
round
and
with
head
thrown
back
and
expanded
chest
came
up
to
the
net
with
that
expression
of
readiness
which
he
well
knew
pushed
in
between
two
prisoners
and
gazed
at
nekhludoff
with
a
surprised
and
questioning
look
but
concluding
from
his
clothing
he
was
a
rich
man
she
smiled
is
it
me
you
want
she
asked
bringing
her
smiling
face
with
the
slightly
squinting
eyes
nearer
the
net
i
ii
wished
to

nekhludoff
did
not
know
how
to
address
her
i
wished
to
see
youi
he
was
not
speaking
louder
than
usual
no
nonsense
i
tell
you

the
tramp
who
stood
next
to
him
have
you
taken
it
or
not
dying
i
tell
you
what
more
do
you
want
some
one
else
was
screaming
at
his
other
side
maslova
could
not
hear
what
nekhludoff
was
saying
but
the
expression
of
his
face
as
he
was
speaking
reminded
her
of
him
she
did
not
believe
her
own
eyes
still
the
smile
vanished
from
her
face
and
a
deep
line
of
suffering
appeared
on
her
brow
i
cannot
hear
what
you
are
saying
she
called
out
wrinkling
her
brow
and
frowning
more
and
more
i
have
come
said
nekhludoff
yes
i
am
doing
my
dutyi
am
confessing
thought
nekhludoff
and
at
this
thought
the
tears
came
in
his
eyes
and
he
felt
a
choking
sensation
in
his
throat
and
holding
on
with
both
hands
to
the
net
he
made
efforts
to
keep
from
bursting
into
tears
i
say
why
do
you
shove
yourself
in
where
youre
not
wanted
some
one
shouted
at
one
side
of
him
god

from

noticing
his
excitement

recognised
him
youre

but
no
i
dont

you
she
shouted
without
looking
at
him
and
blushing
while
her
face
grew
still
more
stern
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
he
said
in
a
loud
but
monotonous
voice
like
a
lesson
learnt
by
heart
having
said
these
words
he
became
confused
but
immediately
came
the
thought
that
if
he
felt
ashamed
it
was
all
the
better
he
had
to
bear
this
shame
and
he
continued
in
a
loud
voice
forgive
me
i
have
wronged
you
terribly
she
stood
motionless
and
without
taking
her
squinting
eyes
off
him
he
could
not
continue
to
speak
and
stepping
away
from
the
net
he
tried
to
suppress
the
sobs
that
were
choking
him
the
inspector
the
same
officer
who
had
directed
nekhludoff
to
the
womens
ward
and
whose
interest
he
seemed
to
have
aroused
came
into
the
room
and
seeing
nekhludoff
not
at
the
net
asked
him
why
he
was
not
talking
to
her
whom
he
wanted
to
see
nekhludoff
blew
his
nose
gave
himself
a
shake
and
trying
to
appear
calm
said
its
so
inconvenient
through
these
nets
nothing
can
be
heard
again
the
inspector
considered
for
a
moment
ah
well
she
can
be
brought
out
here
for
awhile

turning

out
a
minute
later
maslova
came
out
of
the
side
door
stepping
softly
she
came
up
close
to
nekhludoff
stopped
and
looked
up
at
him
from
under
her
brows
her
black
hair
was
arranged
in
ringlets
over
her
forehead
in
the
same
way
as
it
had
been
two
days
ago
her
face
though
unhealthy
and
puffy
was
attractive
and
looked
perfectly
calm
only
the
glittering
black
eyes
glanced
strangely
from
under
the
swollen
lids
you
may
talk
here
said
the
inspector
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
stepped
aside
with
a
look
of
surprise
nekhludoff
moved
towards
a
seat
by
the
wall
maslova
cast
a
questioning
look
at
the
inspector
and
then
shrugging
her
shoulders
in
surprise
followed
nekhludoff
to
the
bench
and
having
arranged
her
skirt
sat
down
beside
him
i
know
it
is
hard
for
you
to
forgive
me
he
began
but
stopped
his
tears
were
choking
him
but
though
i
cant
undo
the
past
i
shall
now
do
what
is
in
my
power
tell
me
how
have
you
managed
to
find
me
she
said
without
answering
his
question
neither
looking
away
from
him
nor
quite
at
him
with
her
squinting
eyes
o
god
help
me
teach
me
what
to
do
nekhludoff
thought
looking
at
her
changed
face
i
was
on
the
jury
the
day
before
yesterday
he
said
you
did
not
recognise
me
no
i
did
not
there
was
not
time
for
recognitions
i
did
not
even
look
she
said
there
was
a
child
was
there
not
he
asked
thank
god
he
died
at
once
she
answered
abruptly
and
viciously
what
do
you
mean
why
i
was
so
ill
myself
i
nearly
died
she
said
in
the
same
quiet
voice
which
nekhludoff
had
not
expected
and
could
not
understand
how
could
my
aunts
have
let
you
go
who
keeps
a
servant
that
has
a
baby
they
sent
me
off
as
soon
as
they
noticed
but
why
speak
of
this
i
remember
nothing
thats
all
finished
no
it
is
not
finished
i
wish
to
redeem
my
sin
theres
nothing
to
redeem
whats
been
has
been
and
is
passed
she
said
and
what
he
never
expected
she
looked
at
him
and
smiled
in
an
unpleasantly
luring
yet
piteous
manner
maslova
never
expected
to
see
him
again
and
certainly
not
here
and
not
now
therefore
when
she
first
recognised
him
she
could
not
keep
back
the
memories
which
she
never
wished
to
revive
in
the
first
moment
she
remembered
dimly
that
new
wonderful
world
of
feeling
and
of
thought
which
had
been
opened
to
her
by
the
charming
young
man
who
loved
her
and
whom
she
loved
and
then
his
incomprehensible
cruelty
and
the
whole
string
of
humiliations
and
suffering
which
flowed
from
and
followed
that
magic
joy
this
gave
her
pain
and
unable
to
understand
it
she
did
what
she
was
always
in
the
habit
of
doing
she
got
rid
of
these
memories
by
enveloping
them
in
the
mist
of
a
depraved
life
in
the
first
moment
she
associated
the
man
now
sitting
beside
her
with
the
lad
she
had
loved
but
feeling
that
this
gave
her
pain
she
dissociated
them
again
now
this
welldressed
carefullygotup
gentleman
with
perfumed
beard
was
no
longer
the
nekhludoff
whom
she
had
loved
but
only
one
of
the
people
who
made
use
of
creatures
like
herself
when
they
needed
them
and
whom
creatures
like
herself
had
to
make
use
of
in
their
turn
as
profitably
as
they
could
and
that
is
why
she
looked
at
him
with
a
luring
smile
and
considered
silently
how
she
could
best
make
use
of
him
thats
all
at
an
end
she
said
now
im
condemned
to
siberia
and
her
lip
trembled
as
she
was
saying
this
dreadful
word
i
knew
i
was
certain
you
were
not
guilty
said
nekhludoff
guilty
of
course
not
as
if
i
could
be
a
thief
or
a
robber
she
stopped
considering
in
what
way
she
could
best
get
something
out
of
him
they
say
here
that
all
depends
on
the
advocate
she
began
a
petition
should
be
handed
in
only
they
say
its
expensive
yes
most
certainly
said
nekhludoff
i
have
already
spoken
to
an
advocate
no
money
ought
to
be
spared
it
should
be
a
good
one
she
said
i
shall
do
all
that
is
possible
they
were
silent
and
then
she
smiled
again
in
the
same
way
and
i
should
like
to
ask
you



a
little
money
if
you
can



not
much
ten
roubles
i
do
not
want
more
she
said
suddenly
yes
yes
nekhludoff
said
with
a
sense
of
confusion
and
felt
for
his
purse
she
looked
rapidly
at
the
inspector
who
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
dont
give
it
in
front
of
him
hed
take
it
away
nekhludoff
took
out
his
purse
as
soon
as
the
inspector
had
turned
his
back
but
had
no
time
to
hand
her
the
note
before
the
inspector
faced
them
again
so
he
crushed
it
up
in
his
hand
this
woman
is
dead
nekhludoff
thought
looking
at
this
once
sweet
and
now
defiled
puffy
face
lit
up
by
an
evil
glitter
in
the
black
squinting
eyes
which
were
now
glancing
at
the
hand
in
which
he
held
the
note
then
following
the
inspectors
movements
and
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
the
tempter
that
had
been
speaking
to
him
in
the
night
again
raised
its
voice
trying
to
lead
him
out
of
the
realm
of
his
inner
into
the
realm
of
his
outer
life
away
from
the
question
of
what
he
should
do
to
the
question
of
what
the
consequences
would
be
and
what
would
be
practical
you
can
do
nothing
with
this
woman
said
the
voice
you
will
only
tie
a
stone
round
your
neck
which
will
help
to
drown
you
and
hinder
you
from
being
useful
to
others
is
it
not
better
to
give
her
all
the
money
that
is
here
say
goodbye
and
finish
with
her
forever
whispered
the
voice
but
here
he
felt
that
now
at
this
very
moment
something
most
important
was
taking
place
in
his
soulthat
his
inner
life
was
as
it
were
wavering
in
the
balance
so
that
the
slightest
effort
would
make
it
sink
to
this
side
or
the
other
and
he
made
this
effort
by
calling
to
his
assistance
that
god
whom
he
had
felt
in
his
soul
the
day
before
and
that
god
instantly
responded
he
resolved
to
tell
her
everything
nowat
once
katusha
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
and
you
have
given
me
no
answer
have
you
forgiven
me
will
you
ever
forgive
me
he
asked
she
did
not
listen
to
him
but
looked
at
his
hand
and
at
the
inspector
and
when
the
latter
turned
she
hastily
stretched
out
her
hand
grasped
the
note
and
hid
it
under
her
belt
thats
odd
what
you
are
saying
there
she
said
with
a
smile
of
contempt
as
it
seemed
to
him
nekhludoff
felt
that
there
was
in
her
soul
one
who
was
his
enemy
and
who
was
protecting
her
such
as
she
was
now
and
preventing
him
from
getting
at
her
heart
but
strange
to
say
this
did
not
repel
him
but
drew
him
nearer
to
her
by
some
fresh
peculiar
power
he
knew
that
he
must
waken
her
soul
that
this
was
terribly
difficult
but
the
very
difficulty
attracted
him
he
now
felt
towards
her
as
he
had
never
felt
towards
her
or
any
one
else
before
there
was
nothing
personal
in
this
feeling
he
wanted
nothing
from
her
for
himself
but
only
wished
that
she
might
not
remain
as
she
now
was
that
she
might
awaken
and
become
again
what
she
had
been
katusha
why
do
you
speak
like
that
i
know
you
i
remember
youand
the
old
days
in
papovo
whats
the
use
of
recalling
whats
past
she
remarked
drily
i
am
recalling
it
in
order
to
put
it
right
to
atone
for
my
sin
katusha
and
he
was
going
to
say
that
he
would
marry
her
but
meeting
her
eyes
he
read
in
them
something
so
dreadful
so
coarse
so
repellent
that
he
could
not
go
on
at
this
moment
the
visitors
began
to
go
the
inspector
came
up
to
nekhludoff
and
said
that
the
time
was
up
goodbye
i
have
still
much
to
say
to
you
but
you
see
it
is
impossible
to
do
so
now
said
nekhludoff
and
held
out
his
hand
i
shall
come
again
i
think
you
have
said
all
she
took
his
hand
but
did
not
press
it
no
i
shall
try
to
see
you
again
somewhere
where
we
can
talk
and
then
i
shall
tell
you
what
i
have
to
saysomething
very
important
well
then
come
why
not
she
answered
and
smiled
with
that
habitual
inviting
and
promising
smile
which
she
gave
to
the
men
whom
she
wished
to
please
you
are
more
than
a
sister
to
me
said
nekhludoff
thats
odd
she
said
again
and
went
behind
the
grating
chapter
xliv
maslovas
view
of
life
before
the
first
interview
nekhludoff
thought
that
when
she
saw
him
and
knew
of
his
intention
to
serve
her
katusha
would
be
pleased
and
touched
and
would
be
katusha
again
but
to
his
horror
he
found
that
katusha
existed
no
more
and
there
was
maslova
in
her
place
this
astonished
and
horrified
him
what
astonished
him
most
was
that
katusha
was
not
ashamed
of
her
positionnot
the
position
of
a
prisoner
she
was
ashamed
of
that
but
her
position
as
a
prostitute
she
seemed
satisfied
even
proud
of
it
and
yet
how
could
it
be
otherwise
everybody
in
order
to
be
able
to
act
has
to
consider
his
occupation
important
and
good
therefore
in
whatever
position
a
person
is
he
is
certain
to
form
such
a
view
of
the
life
of
men
in
general
which
will
make
his
occupation
seem
important
and
good
it
is
usually
imagined
that
a
thief
a
murderer
a
spy
a
prostitute
acknowledging
his
or
her
profession
as
evil
is
ashamed
of
it
but
the
contrary
is
true
people
whom
fate
and
their
sinmistakes
have
placed
in
a
certain
position
however
false
that
position
may
be
form
a
view
of
life
in
general
which
makes
their
position
seem
good
and
admissible
in
order
to
keep
up
their
view
of
life
these
people
instinctively
keep
to
the
circle
of
those
people
who
share
their
views
of
life
and
their
own
place
in
it
this
surprises
us
where
the
persons
concerned
are
thieves
bragging
about
their
dexterity
prostitutes
vaunting
their
depravity
or
murderers
boasting
of
their
cruelty
this
surprises
us
only
because
the
circle
the
atmosphere
in
which
these
people
live
is
limited
and
we
are
outside
it
but
can
we
not
observe
the
same
phenomenon
when
the
rich
boast
of
their
wealth
ie
robbery
the
commanders
in
the
army
pride
themselves
on
victories
ie
murder
and
those
in
high
places
vaunt
their
power
ie
violence
we
do
not
see
the
perversion
in
the
views
of
life
held
by
these
people
only
because
the
circle
formed
by
them
is
more
extensive
and
we
ourselves
are
moving
inside
of
it
and
in
this
manner
maslova
had
formed
her
views
of
life
and
of
her
own
position
she
was
a
prostitute
condemned
to
siberia
and
yet
she
had
a
conception
of
life
which
made
it
possible
for
her
to
be
satisfied
with
herself
and
even
to
pride
herself
on
her
position
before
others
according
to
this
conception
the
highest
good
for
all
men
without
exceptionold
young
schoolboys
generals
educated
and
uneducated
was
connected
with
the
relation
of
the
sexes
therefore
all
men
even
when
they
pretended
to
be
occupied
with
other
things
in
reality
took
this
view
she
was
an
attractive
woman
and
therefore
she
was
an
important
and
necessary
person
the
whole
of
her
former
and
present
life
was
a
confirmation
of
the
correctness
of
this
conception
with
such
a
view
of
life
she
was
by
no
means
the
lowest
but
a
very
important
person
and
maslova
prized
this
view
of
life
more
than
anything
she
could
not
but
prize
it
for
if
she
lost
the
importance
that
such
a
view
of
life
gave
her
among
men
she
would
lose
the
meaning
of
her
life
and
in
order
not
to
lose
the
meaning
of
her
life
she
instinctively
clung
to
the
set
that
looked
at
life
in
the
same
way
as
she
did
feeling
that
nekhludoff
wanted
to
lead
her
out
into
another
world
she
resisted
him
foreseeing
that
she
would
have
to
lose
her
place
in
life
with
the
selfpossession
and
selfrespect
it
gave
her
for
this
reason
she
drove
from
her
the
recollections
of
her
early
youth
and
her
first
relations
with
nekhludoff
these
recollections
did
not
correspond
with
her
present
conception
of
the
world
and
were
therefore
quite
rubbed
out
of
her
mind
or
rather
lay
somewhere
buried
and
untouched
closed
up
and
plastered
over
so
that
they
should
not
escape
as
when
bees
in
order
to
protect
the
result
of
their
labour
will
sometimes
plaster
a
nest
of
worms
therefore
the
present
nekhludoff
was
not
the
man
she
had
once
loved
with
a
pure
love
but
only
a
rich
gentleman
whom
she
could
and
must
make
use
of
and
with
whom
she
could
only
have
the
same
relations
as
with
men
in
general
no
i
could
not
tell
her
the
chief
thing
thought
nekhludoff
moving
towards
the
front
doors
with
the
rest
of
the
people
i
did
not
tell
her
that
i
would
marry
her
i
did
not
tell
her
so
but
i
will
he
thought
the
two
warders
at
the
door
let
out
the
visitors
counting
them
again
and
touching
each
one
with
their
hands
so
that
no
extra
person
should
go
out
and
none
remain
within
the
slap
on
his
shoulder
did
not
offend
nekhludoff
this
time
he
did
not
even
notice
it
chapter
xlv
fanarin
the
advocatethe
petition
nekhludoff
meant
to
rearrange
the
whole
of
his
external
life
to
let
his
large
house
and
move
to
an
hotel
but
agraphena
petrovna
pointed
out
that
it
was
useless
to
change
anything
before
the
winter
no
one
would
rent
a
town
house
for
the
summer
anyhow
he
would
have
to
live
and
keep
his
things
somewhere
and
so
all
his
efforts
to
change
his
manner
of
life
he
meant
to
live
more
simply
as
the
students
live
led
to
nothing
not
only
did
everything
remain
as
it
was
but
the
house
was
suddenly
filled
with
new
activity
all
that
was
made
of
wool
or
fur
was
taken
out
to
be
aired
and
beaten
the
gatekeeper
the
boy
the
cook
and
corney
himself
took
part
in
this
activity
all
sorts
of
strange
furs
which
no
one
ever
used
and
various
uniforms
were
taken
out
and
hung
on
a
line
then
the
carpets
and
furniture
were
brought
out
and
the
gatekeeper
and
the
boy
rolled
their
sleeves
up
their
muscular
arms
and
stood
beating
these
things
keeping
strict
time
while
the
rooms
were
filled
with
the
smell
of
naphthaline
when
nekhludoff
crossed
the
yard
or
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
all
this
going
on
he
was
surprised
at
the
great
number
of
things
there
were
all
quite
useless
their
only
use
nekhludoff
thought
was
the
providing
of
exercise
for
agraphena
petrovna
corney
the
gatekeeper
the
boy
and
the
cook
but
its
not
worth
while
altering
my
manner
of
life
now
he
thought
while
maslovas
case
is
not
decided
besides
it
is
too
difficult
it
will
alter
of
itself
when
she
will
be
set
free
or
exiled
and
i
follow
her
on
the
appointed
day
nekhludoff
drove
up
to
the
advocate
fanarins
own
splendid
house
which
was
decorated
with
huge
palms
and
other
plants
and
wonderful
curtains
in
fact
with
all
the
expensive
luxury
witnessing
to
the
possession
of
much
idle
money
ie
money
acquired
without
labour
which
only
those
possess
who
grow
rich
suddenly
in
the
waitingroom
just
as
in
a
doctors
waitingroom
he
found
many
dejectedlooking
people
sitting
round
several
tables
on
which
lay
illustrated
papers
meant
to
amuse
them
awaiting
their
turns
to
be
admitted
to
the
advocate
the
advocates
assistant
sat
in
the
room
at
a
high
desk
and
having
recognised
nekhludoff
he
came
up
to
him
and
said
he
would
go
and
announce
him
at
once
but
the
assistant
had
not
reached
the
door
before
it
opened
and
the
sounds
of
loud
animated
voices
were
heard
the
voice
of
a
middleaged
sturdy
merchant
with
a
red
face
and
thick
moustaches
and
the
voice
of
fanarin
himself
fanarin
was
also
a
middleaged
man
of
medium
height
with
a
worn
look
on
his
face
both
faces
bore
the
expression
which
you
see
on
the
faces
of
those
who
have
just
concluded
a
profitable
but
not
quite
honest
transaction
your
own
fault
you
know
my
dear
sir
fanarin
said
smiling
wed
all
be
in
eaven
were
it
not
for
hour
sins
oh
yes
yes
we
all
know
that
and
both
laughed
unnaturally
oh
prince
nekhludoff
please
to
step
in
said
fanarin
seeing
him
and
nodding
once
more
to
the
merchant
he
led
nekhludoff
into
his
business
cabinet
furnished
in
a
severely
correct
style
wont
you
smoke
said
the
advocate
sitting
down
opposite
nekhludoff
and
trying
to
conceal
a
smile
apparently
still
excited
by
the
success
of
the
accomplished
transaction
thanks
i
have
come
about
maslovas
case
yes
yes
directly
but
oh
what
rogues
these
fat
money
bags
are
he
said
you
saw
this
here
fellow
why
he
has
about
twelve
million
roubles
and
he
cannot
speak
correctly
and
if
he
can
get
a
twentyfive
rouble
note
out
of
you
hell
have
it
if
hes
to
wrench
it
out
with
his
teeth
he
says
eaven
and
hour
and
you
say
this
here
fellow
nekhludoff
thought
with
an
insurmountable
feeling
of
aversion
towards
this
man
who
wished
to
show
by
his
free
and
easy
manner
that
he
and
nekhludoff
belonged
to
one
and
the
same
camp
while
his
other
clients
belonged
to
another
he
has
worried
me
to
deatha
fearful
scoundrel
i
felt
i
must
relieve
my
feelings
said
the
advocate
as
if
to
excuse
his
speaking
about
things
that
had
no
reference
to
business
well
how
about
your
case
i
have
read
it
attentively
but
do
not
approve
of
it
i
mean
that
greenhorn
of
an
advocate
has
left
no
valid
reason
for
an
appeal
well
then
what
have
you
decided
one
moment
tell
him
he
said
to
his
assistant
who
had
just
come
in
that
i
keep
to
what
i
have
said
if
he
can
its
all
right
if
not
no
matter
but
he
wont
agree
well
no
matter
and
the
advocate
frowned
there
now
and
it
is
said
that
we
advocates
get
our
money
for
nothing
he
remarked
after
a
pause
i
have
freed
one
insolvent
debtor
from
a
totally
false
charge
and
now
they
all
flock
to
me
yet
every
such
case
costs
enormous
labour
why
dont
we
too
lose
bits
of
flesh
in
the
inkstand
as
some
writer
or
other
has
said
well
as
to
your
case
or
rather
the
case
you
are
taking
an
interest
in
it
has
been
conducted
abominably
there
is
no
good
reason
for
appealing
still
he
continued
we
can
but
try
to
get
the
sentence
revoked
this
is
what
i
have
noted
down
he
took
up
several
sheets
of
paper
covered
with
writing
and
began
to
read
rapidly
slurring
over
the
uninteresting
legal
terms
and
laying
particular
stress
on
some
sentences
to
the
court
of
appeal
criminal
department
etc
etc
according
to
the
decisions
etc
the
verdict
etc
soandso
maslova
pronounced
guilty
of
having
caused
the
death
through
poison
of
the
merchant
smelkoff
and
has
according
to
statute
1454
of
the
penal
code
been
sentenced
to
siberia
etc
etc
he
stopped
evidently
in
spite
of
his
being
so
used
to
it
he
still
felt
pleasure
in
listening
to
his
own
productions
this
sentence
is
the
direct
result
of
the
most
glaring
judicial
perversion
and
error
he
continued
impressively
and
there
are
grounds
for
its
revocation
firstly
the
reading
of
the
medical
report
of
the
examination
of
smelkoffs
intestines
was
interrupted
by
the
president
at
the
very
beginning
this
is
point
one
but
it
was
the
prosecuting
side
that
demanded
this
reading
nekhludoff
said
with
surprise
that
does
not
matter
there
might
have
been
reasons
for
the
defence
to
demand
this
reading
too
oh
but
there
could
have
been
no
reason
whatever
for
that
it
is
a
ground
for
appeal
though
to
continue
secondly
he
went
on
reading
when
maslovas
advocate
in
his
speech
for
the
defence
wishing
to
characterise
maslovas
personality
referred
to
the
causes
of
her
fall
he
was
interrupted
by
the
president
calling
him
to
order
for
the
alleged
deviation
from
the
direct
subject
yet
as
has
been
repeatedly
pointed
out
by
the
senate
the
elucidation
of
the
criminals
characteristics
and
his
or
her
moral
standpoint
in
general
has
a
significance
of
the
first
importance
in
criminal
cases
even
if
only
as
a
guide
in
the
settling
of
the
question
of
imputation
thats
point
two
he
said
with
a
look
at
nekhludoff
but
he
spoke
so
badly
that
no
one
could
make
anything
of
it
nekhludoff
said
still
more
astonished
the
fellows
quite
a
fool
and
of
course
could
not
be
expected
to
say
anything
sensible
fanarin
said
laughing
but
all
the
same
it
will
do
as
a
reason
for
appeal
thirdly
the
president
in
his
summing
up
contrary
to
the
direct
decree
of
section
1
statute
801
of
the
criminal
code
omitted
to
inform
the
jury
what
the
judicial
points
are
that
constitute
guilt
and
did
not
mention
that
having
admitted
the
fact
of
maslova
having
administered
the
poison
to
smelkoff
the
jury
had
a
right
not
to
impute
the
guilt
of
murder
to
her
since
the
proofs
of
wilful
intent
to
deprive
smelkoff
of
life
were
absent
and
only
to
pronounce
her
guilty
of
carelessness
resulting
in
the
death
of
the
merchant
which
she
did
not
desire
this
is
the
chief
point
yes
but
we
ought
to
have
known
that
ourselves
it
was
our
mistake
and
now
the
fourth
point
the
advocate
continued
the
form
of
the
answer
given
by
the
jury
contained
an
evident
contradiction
maslova
is
accused
of
wilfully
poisoning
smelkoff
her
one
object
being
that
of
cupidity
the
only
motive
to
commit
murder
she
could
have
had
the
jury
in
their
verdict
acquit
her
of
the
intent
to
rob
or
participation
in
the
stealing
of
valuables
from
which
it
follows
that
they
intended
also
to
acquit
her
of
the
intent
to
murder
and
only
through
a
misunderstanding
which
arose
from
the
incompleteness
of
the
presidents
summing
up
omitted
to
express
it
in
due
form
in
their
answer
therefore
an
answer
of
this
kind
by
the
jury
absolutely
demanded
the
application
of
statutes
816
and
808
of
the
criminal
code
of
procedure
ie
an
explanation
by
the
president
to
the
jury
of
the
mistake
made
by
them
and
another
debate
on
the
question
of
the
prisoners
guilt
then
why
did
the
president
not
do
it
i
too
should
like
to
know
why
fanarin
said
laughing
then
the
senate
will
of
course
correct
this
error
that
will
all
depend
on
who
will
preside
there
at
the
time
well
now
there
it
is
i
have
further
said
he
continued
rapidly
a
verdict
of
this
kind
gave
the
court
no
right
to
condemn
maslova
to
be
punished
as
a
criminal
and
to
apply
section
3
statute
771
of
the
penal
code
to
her
case
this
is
a
decided
and
gross
violation
of
the
basic
principles
of
our
criminal
law
in
view
of
the
reasons
stated
i
have
the
honour
of
appealing
to
you
etc
etc
the
refutation
according
to
909
910
and
section
2
912
and
928
statute
of
the
criminal
code
etc
etc



to
carry
this
case
before
another
department
of
the
same
court
for
a
further
examination
there
all
that
can
be
done
is
done
but
to
be
frank
i
have
little
hope
of
success
though
of
course
it
all
depends
on
what
members
will
be
present
at
the
senate
if
you
have
any
influence
there
you
can
but
try
i
do
know
some
all
right
only
be
quick
about
it
else
theyll
all
go
off
for
a
change
of
air
then
you
may
have
to
wait
three
months
before
they
return
then
in
case
of
failure
we
have
still
the
possibility
of
appealing
to
his
majesty
this
too
depends
on
the
private
influence
you
can
bring
to
work
in
this
case
too
i
am
at
your
service
i
mean
as
to
the
working
of
the
petition
not
the
influence
thank
you
now
as
to
your
fees
my
assistant
will
hand
you
the
petition
and
tell
you
one
thing
more
the
procureur
gave
me
a
pass
for
visiting
this
person
in
prison
but
they
tell
me
i
must
also
get
a
permission
from
the
governor
in
order
to
get
an
interview
at
another
time
and
in
another
place
than
those
appointed
is
this
necessary
yes
i
think
so
but
the
governor
is
away
at
present
a
vicegovernor
is
in
his
place
and
he
is
such
an
impenetrable
fool
that
youll
scarcely
be
able
to
do
anything
with
him
is
it
meslennikoff
yes
i
know
him
said
nekhludoff
and
got
up
to
go
at
this
moment
a
horribly
ugly
little
bony
snubnosed
yellowfaced
woman
flew
into
the
room
it
was
the
advocates
wife
who
did
not
seem
to
be
in
the
least
bit
troubled
by
her
ugliness
she
was
attired
in
the
most
original
manner
she
seemed
enveloped
in
something
made
of
velvet
and
silk
something
yellow
and
green
and
her
thin
hair
was
crimped
she
stepped
out
triumphantly
into
the
anteroom
followed
by
a
tall
smiling
man
with
a
greenish
complexion
dressed
in
a
coat
with
silk
facings
and
a
white
tie
this
was
an
author
nekhludoff
knew
him
by
sight
she
opened
the
cabinet
door
and
said
anatole
you
must
come
to
me
here

simeon
ivanovitch
who
will
read
his
poems
and
you
must
absolutely
come
and
read
about
garshin
nekhludoff
noticed
that
she
whispered
something
to
her
husband
and
thinking
it
was
something
concerning
him
wished
to
go
away
but
she
caught
him
up
and
said
i
beg
your
pardon
prince
i
know
you
and
thinking
an
introduction
superfluous
i
beg
you
to
stay
and
take
part
in
our
literary
matinee
it
will
be
most
interesting
m
fanarin
will
read
you
see
what
a
lot
i
have
to
do
said
fanarin
spreading
out
his
hands
and
smilingly
pointing
to
his
wife
as
if
to
show
how
impossible
it
was
to
resist
so
charming
a
creature
nekhludoff
thanked
the
advocates
wife
with
extreme
politeness
for
the
honour
she
did
him
in
inviting
him
but
refused
the
invitation
with
a
sad
and
solemn
look
and
left
the
room
what
an
affected
fellow
said
the
advocates
wife
when
he
had
gone
out
in
the
anteroom
the
assistant
handed
him
a
readywritten
petition
and
said
that
the
fees
including
the
business
with
the
senate
and
the
commission
would
come
to
1000
roubles
and
explained
that
m
fanarin
did
not
usually
undertake
this
kind
of
business
but
did
it
only
to
oblige
nekhludoff
and
about
this
petition
who
is
to
sign
it
the
prisoner
may
do
it
herself
or
if
this
is
inconvenient
m
fanarin
can
if
he
gets
a
power
of
attorney
from
her
oh
no
i
shall
take
the
petition
to
her
and
get
her
to
sign
it
said
nekhludoff
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
seeing
her
before

flogging
at
the
usual
time
the
jailers
whistle
sounded
in
the
corridors
of
the
prison
the
iron
doors
of
the
cells
rattled
bare
feet
pattered
heels
clattered
and
the
prisoners
who
acted
as
scavengers
passed
along
the
corridors
filling
the
air
with
disgusting
smells
the
prisoners
washed
dressed
and
came
out
for
revision
then
went
to
get
boiling
water
for
their
tea
the
conversation
at
breakfast
in
all
the
cells
was
very
lively
it
was
all
about
two
prisoners
who
were
to
be
flogged
that
day
one
vasiliev
was
a
young
man
of
some
education
a
clerk
who
had
killed
his
mistress
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
his
fellowprisoners
liked
him
because
he
was
merry
and
generous
and
firm
in
his
behaviour
with
the
prison
authorities
he
knew
the
laws
and
insisted
on
their
being
carried
out
therefore
he
was
disliked
by
the
authorities
three
weeks
before
a
jailer
struck
one
of
the
scavengers
who
had
spilt
some
soup
over
his
new
uniform
vasiliev
took
the
part
of
the
scavenger
saying
that
it
was
not
lawful
to
strike
a
prisoner
ill
teach
you
the
law
said
the
jailer
and
gave
vasiliev
a
scolding
vasiliev
replied
in
like
manner
and
the
jailer
was
going
to
hit
him
but
vasiliev
seized
the
jailers
hands
held
them
fast
for
about
three
minutes
and
after
giving
the
hands
a
twist
pushed
the
jailer
out
of
the
door
the
jailer
complained
to
the
inspector
who
ordered
vasiliev
to
be
put
into
a
solitary
cell
the
solitary
cells
were
a
row
of
dark
closets
locked
from
outside
and
there
were
neither
beds
nor
chairs
nor
tables
in
them
so
that
the
inmates
had
to
sit
or
lie
on
the
dirty
floor
while
the
rats
of
which
there
were
a
great
many
in
those
cells
ran
across
them
the
rats
were
so
bold
that
they
stole
the
bread
from
the
prisoners
and
even
attacked
them
if
they
stopped
moving
vasiliev
said
he
would
not
go
into
the
solitary
cell
because
he
had
not
done
anything
wrong
but
they
used
force
then
he
began
struggling
and
two
other
prisoners
helped
him
to
free
himself
from
the
jailers
all
the
jailers
assembled
and
among
them
was
petrov
who
was
distinguished
for
his
strength
the
prisoners
got
thrown
down
and
pushed
into
the
solitary
cells
the
governor
was
immediately
informed
that
something
very
like
a
rebellion
had
taken
place
and
he
sent
back
an
order
to
flog
the
two
chief
offenders
vasiliev
and
the
tramp
nepomnishy
giving
each
thirty
strokes
with
a
birch
rod
the
flogging
was
appointed
to
take
place
in
the
womens
interviewingroom
all
this
was
known
in
the
prison
since
the
evening
and
it
was
being
talked
about
with
animation
in
all
the
cells
korableva
khoroshevka
theodosia
and
maslova
sat
together
in
their
corner
drinking
tea
all
of
them
flushed
and
animated
by
the
vodka
they
had
drunk
for
maslova
who
now
had
a
constant
supply
of
vodka
freely
treated
her
companions
to
it
hes
not
been
arioting
or
anything
korableva
said
referring
to
vasiliev
as
she
bit
tiny
pieces
off
a
lump
of
sugar
with
her
strong
teeth
he
only
stuck
up
for
a
chum
because
its
not
lawful
to
strike
prisoners
nowadays
and
hes
a
fine
fellow
ive
heard
say
said
theodosia
who
sat
bareheaded
with
her
long
plaits
round
her
head
on
a
log
of
wood
opposite
the
shelf
bedstead
on
which
the
teapot
stood
there
now
if
you
were

to

him

nekhludoff

maslova
said
tossing
her
head
and
smiling
yes
but
when
is
he
coming
and
theyve
already
gone
to
fetch
them
said
theodosia
it
is
terrible
she
added
with
a
sigh
i
once
did
see
how
they
flogged
a
peasant
in
the
village
fatherinlaw
he
sent
me
once
to
the
village
elder
well
i
went
and
there




the
watchmans
wife
began
her
long
story
which
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
voices
and
steps
in
the
corridor
above
them
the
women
were
silent
and
sat
listening
there
they
are
hauling
him
along
the
devils
khoroshavka
said
theyll
do
him
to
death
they
will
the
jailers
are
so
enraged
with
him
because
he
never
would
give
in
to
them
all
was
quiet
again
upstairs
and
the
watchmans
wife
finished
her
story
of
how
she
was
that
frightened
when
she
went
into
the
barn
and
saw
them
flogging
a
peasant
her
inside
turned
at
the
sight
and
so
on
khoroshevka
related
how
schegloff
had
been
flogged
and
never
uttered
a
sound
then
theodosia
put
away
the
tea
things
and
korableva
and
the
watchmans
wife
took
up
their
sewing
maslova
sat
down
on
the
bedstead
with
her
arms
round
her
knees
dull
and
depressed
she
was
about
to
lie
down
and
try
to
sleep
when
the
woman
warder
called
her
into
the
office
to
see
a
visitor
now
mind
and
dont
forget
to
tell
him

was
arranging
the
kerchief
on
her
head
before
the
dim
lookingglass
we
did
not
set

to

house
but
he
himself
the
fiend
did
it
his
workman
saw
him
do
it
and
will

up
in

when
we
never

she
added
with
a
wink
and
korableva
poured
out
half
a
cup
of
vodka
which
maslova
drank
then
having
wiped
her
mouth
and
repeating
the
words
just
to
keep
up
courage
tossing
her
head
and
smiling
gaily
she
followed

along

maslova
nekhludoff
had
to
wait
in
the
hall
for
a
long
time
when
he
had
arrived
at
the
prison
and
rung
at
the
entrance
door
he
handed
the
permission
of

to
the
jailer
on

who
met
him
no
no
the
jailer
on

said
hurriedly
the
inspector

engaged
in

asked
nekhludoff
no
here
in
the
interviewingroom
why

said
nekhludoff
when
the
inspector
comes
out
youll
tell
himwait
a
bit
said
the
jailer
at
this
moment
a
sergeantmajor
with
a
smooth
shiny
face
and
moustaches
impregnated
with
tobacco
smoke
came
out
of
a
side
door
with
the
gold
cords
of
his
uniform
glistening
and
addressed
the
jailer
in
a
severe
tone
what
do
you
mean
by
letting
any
one
in
here
the
office



i
was
told
the
inspector
was
here
said
nekhludoff
surprised
at
the
agitation
he
noticed
in
the
sergeantmajors
manner
at
this
moment
the
inner
door
opened
and
petrov
came
out
heated
and
perspiring
hell
remember
it
he
muttered
turning
to
the
sergeant
major
the
latter
pointed
at
nekhludoff
by
a
look
and
petrov
knitted
his
brows
and
went
out
through
a
door
at
the
back
who
will
remember
it
why
do
they
all
seem
so
confused
why
did
the
sergeantmajor
make
a
sign
to
him
nekhludoff
thought
the
sergeantmajor
again
addressing
nekhludoff
said
you
cannot
meet
here
please
step
across
to
the
office
and
nekhludoff
was
about
to
comply
when
the
inspector
came
out
of
the
door
at
the
back
looking
even
more
confused
than
his
subordinates
and
sighing
continually
when
he
saw
nekhludoff
he
turned
to
the
jailer
fedotoff
have
maslova

taken
to
the
office
will
you
come
this
way
please
he
said
turning
to
nekhludoff
they
ascended
a
steep
staircase
and
entered
a
little
room
with
one
window
a
writingtable
and
a
few
chairs
in
it
the
inspector
sat
down
mine
are
heavy
heavy
duties
he
remarked
again
addressing
nekhludoff
and
took
out
a
cigarette
you
are
tired
evidently
said
nekhludoff
tired
of
the
whole
of
the
servicethe
duties
are
very
trying
one
tries
to
lighten
their
lot
and
only
makes
it
worse
my
only
thought
is
how
to
get
away
heavy
heavy
duties
nekhludoff
did
not
know
what
the
inspectors
particular
difficulties
were
but
he
saw
that
today
he
was
in
a
peculiarly
dejected
and
hopeless
condition
calling
for
pity
yes
i
should
think
the
duties
were
heavy
for
a
kindhearted
man
he
said
why
do
you
serve
in
this
capacity
i
have
a
family
but
if
it
is
so
hard
well
still
you
know
it
is
possible
to
be
of
use
in
some
measure
i
soften
down
all
i
can
another
in
my
place
would
conduct
the
affairs
quite
differently
why
we
have
more
than
2000
persons
here
and
what
persons
one
must
know
how
to
manage
them
it
is
easier
said
than
done
you
know
after
all
they
are
also
men
one
cannot
help
pitying
them
the
inspector
began
telling
nekhludoff
of
a
fight
that
had
lately
taken
place
among
the
convicts
which
had
ended
by
one
man
being
killed
the
story
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
maslova
who
was
accompanied
by
a
jailer
nekhludoff
saw
her
through
the
doorway
before
she
had
noticed
the
inspector
she
was
following
the
warder
briskly
smiling
and
tossing
her
head
when
she
saw
the
inspector
she
suddenly
changed
and
gazed
at
him
with
a
frightened
look
but
quickly
recovering
she
addressed
nekhludoff
boldly
and
gaily
how
dyou

she
said
drawling
out
her
words
and
smilingly
took
his
hand
and
shook
it
vigorously
not
like
the
first
time
here
ive
brought
you
a
petition
to
sign
said
nekhludoff
rather
surprised
by
the
boldness
with
which
she
greeted
him
today
the
advocate
has
written

a
petition

she
said
with
a
wink
and
a
smile
and
nekhludoff
drew
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
and
went
up
to
the
table
may
she
sign

asked
nekhludoff
turning
to
the
inspector

all
right

pen

said
the
inspector
i
could
at
one
time
she
said
and
after
arranging
her
skirt
and
the
sleeves
of
her
jacket
she
sat
down
at
the
table
smiled
awkwardly
took
the
pen
with
her
small
energetic
hand
and
glanced
at
nekhludoff
with
a
laugh
nekhludoff
told
her
what
to
write
and
pointed
out
the
place
where
to
sign
sighing
deeply
as
she
dipped
her
pen
into
the
ink
and
carefully
shaking
some
drops
off
the
pen
she
wrote
her
name
is
it
all
she
asked
looking
from
nekhludoff
to
the
inspector
and
putting
the
pen
now
on
the
inkstand
now
on
the
papers
i

a
few
words

nekhludoff
said
taking
the
pen
from
her
all
right
tell
me
she
said
and
suddenly
as
if
remembering
something
or
feeling
sleepy
she
grew
serious
the
inspector
rose
and
left
the
room
and
nekhludoff
remained
with
her

refuses
to
marry
the
jailer
who
had
brought
maslova
in
sat
on
a
windowsill
at
some
distance
from
them
the
decisive
moment
had
come
for
nekhludoff
he
had
been
incessantly
blaming
himself
for
not
having
told
her
the
principal
thing
at
the
first
interview
and
was
now
determined
to
tell
her
that
he
would
marry
her
she
was
sitting
at
the
further
side
of
the
table
nekhludoff
sat
down
opposite
her
it
was
light
in
the
room
and
nekhludoff
for
the
first
time
saw
her
face
quite
near
he
distinctly
saw
the
crowsfeet
round
her
eyes
the
wrinkles
round
her
mouth
and
the
swollen
eyelids
he
felt
more
sorry
than
before
leaning
over
the
table
so
as
not
to
be
heard
by
the
jailera
man
of
jewish
type
with
grizzly
whiskers
who
sat
by
the
windownekhludoff
said
should
this
petition
come
to
nothing
we
shall
appeal
to
the
emperor
all
that
is
possible
shall
be
done
there
now
if
we
had
had
a
proper
advocate
from
the
first
she
interrupted
my
defendant
was
quite
a
silly
he
did
nothing
but
pay
me
compliments
she
said
and
laughed
if
it
had
then
been
known
that
i
was
acquainted
with
you
it
would
have
been
another
matter
they
think
every
ones
a
thief
how
strange
she
is
today
nekhludoff
thought
and
was
just
going
to
say
what
he
had
on
his
mind
when
she
began
again
theres
something
i

to
say

old
woman

him

thus
spoke
maslova
turning
her
head
from
side
to
side
and
glancing
at
nekhludoff
their
names
menshoff
well

and
she
smiled
glanced
up
at
him
and
then
cast
down
her
eyes
all
right
ill
find
out
about
them
nekhludoff
said
more
and
more
astonished
by
her
freeandeasy
manner
but
i
was
going
to
speak
to
you
about
myself
do
you
remember
what
i
told
you
last
time
you
said
a
lot
last
time
what
was
it
you
told
me
she
said
continuing
to
smile
and
to
turn
her
head
from
side
to
side
i
said
i
had
come
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
he
began
whats
the
use
of
that
forgive
forgive
wheres
the
good
of
to
atone
for
my
sin
not
by
mere
words
but
in
deed
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
marry
you
an
expression
of
fear
suddenly
came
over
her
face
her
squinting
eyes
remained
fixed
on
him
and
yet
seemed
not
to
be
looking
at
him
whats
that
for
she
said
with
an
angry
frown
i
feel
that
it
is
my
duty
before
god
to
do
it
what
god
have
you
found
now
you
are
not
saying
what
you
ought
to
god
indeed
what
god
you
ought
to
have
remembered
god
then
she
said
and
stopped
with
her
mouth
open
it
was
only
now
that
nekhludoff
noticed
that
her
breath
smelled
of
spirits
and
that
he
understood
the
cause
of
her
excitement
try
and
be
calm
he
said
why
should
i
be
calm
she
began
quickly
flushing
scarlet
i
am
a
convict
and
you
are
a
gentleman
and
a
prince

however
cruelly

he
said
trembling
all
over

imagine
to
what
extent
i
feel
myself
guilty
towards
you

yourself

she
said
angrily
mimicking
him
you
did
not
feel
so
then
but
threw
me
100
roubles
thats
your
price
i
know
i
know
but
what
is
to
be

said
nekhludoff
i
have
decided
not
to
leave
you
and
what
i
have
said
i
shall
do
and
i

she
said
and
laughed
aloud
katusha
he
said
touching
her
hand

away
i
am
a
convict
and

she
cried
pulling
away
her
hand
her
whole
appearance
transformed
by
her
wrath
youve
got
pleasure
out
of

she
screamed
starting
to
her
feet
the
jailer
came
up
to
them
what
are
you
kicking
up
this
row
for
that
wont
let
her
alone

said
nekhludoff
she
must
not
forget
herself
said
the
jailer
please
wait
a
little
said
nekhludoff
and
the
jailer
returned
to
the
window
maslova
sat
down
again
dropping
her
eyes
and
firmly
clasping
her
small
hands
nekhludoff
stooped
over
her
not
knowing
what
to
do
you
do
not
believe
me
he
said
that
you
mean
to
marry
me
it
will
never
be
ill
rather
hang
myself
so

plain
truth
she
said
oh
why
did
i
not
die
then
she
added
and
began
to
cry
piteously
nekhludoff
could
not
speak
her
tears
infected
him
she
lifted
her
eyes
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
began
to
wipe
her
tears
with
her
kerchief
the
jailer
came
up
again
and
reminded
them
that
it
was
time
to
part
maslova

excited
if
it
is
possible

said
nekhludoff
she
gave
him
no
answer
and
without
looking
up
followed
the
jailer
out
of
the
room

when
maslova

to
the

the
most
of
it

remarked
the

with
her
musical
voice
when
a
poor
man
thinks
of
getting
married
theres
many
a
slip
twixt
the
cup
and
the
lip
but
a
rich
man
need
only
make
up
his
mind
and
its
done
we
knew
a
toff
like
that
duckie
what
dyou
think
he
did
well
have
you
spoken
about
my
affairs
the
old
woman
asked
but
maslova
gave
her
fellowprisoners
no
answer
she
lay
down
on
the
shelf
bedstead
her
squinting
eyes
fixed
on
a
corner
of
the
room
and
lay
there
until
the
evening
a
painful
struggle
went
on
in
her
soul
what
nekhludoff
had
told
her
called
up
the
memory
of
that
world
in
which
she
had
suffered
and
which
she
had
left
without
having
understood
hating
it
she
now
feared
to
wake
from
the
trance
in
which
she
was
living
not
having
arrived
at
any
conclusion
when
evening
came
she
again
bought
some
vodka
and
drank
with
her
companions

so
this
is
what
it
means
this
thought
nekhludoff
as
he
left
the
prison
only
now
fully
understanding
his
crime
if
he
had
not
tried
to
expiate
his
guilt
he
would
never
have
found
out
how
great
his
crime
was
nor
was
this
all
she
too
would
never
have
felt
the
whole
horror
of
what
had
been
done
to
her
he
only
now
saw
what
he
had
done
to
the
soul
of
this
woman
only
now
she
saw
and
understood
what
had
been
done
to
her
up
to
this
time
nekhludoff
had
played
with
a
sensation
of
selfadmiration
had
admired
his
own
remorse
now
he
was
simply
filled
with
horror
he
knew
he
could
not
throw
her
up
now
and
yet
he
could
not
imagine
what
would
come
of
their
relations
to
one
another
just
as
he
was
going
out
a
jailer
with
a
disagreeable
insinuating
countenance
and
a
cross
and
medals
on
his
breast
came
up
and
handed
him
a
note
with
an
air
of
mystery
here
is
a
note
from
a
certain
person
your
honour
he
said
to
nekhludoff
as
he
gave
him
the
envelope
what
person
you
will
know
when
you
read
it
a
political
prisoner
i
am
in
that
ward
so
she
asked
me
and
though
it
is
against
the
rules
still
feelings
of
humanity
the
jailer
spoke
in
an
unnatural
manner
nekhludoff
was
surprised
that
a
jailer
of
the
ward
where
political
prisoners
were
kept
should
pass
notes
inside
the
very
prison
walls
and
almost
within
sight
of
every
one
he
did
not
then
know
that
this
was
both
a
jailer
and
a
spy
however
he
took
the
note
and
read
it
on
coming
out
of
the
prison
the
note
was
written
in
a
bold
hand
and
ran
as
follows
having
heard
that
you
visit
the
prison
and
are
interested
in
the
case
of
a
criminal
prisoner
the
desire
of
seeing
you
arose
in
me
ask
for
a
permission
to
see
me
i
can
give
you

where
nekhludoff
and
some
friends
of
his
had
once
put
up
while
bear
hunting
nekhludoff
gladly
and
vividly
recalled
those
old
days
and
his
acquaintance
with

it
was
just
before

when
the
master
of
the

where
they
were
putting
up
came
in
to

that

pretty
some
one
asked

nekhludoff
said
and
rose
with
a
serious
look
on
his
face
wiping
his
mouth
and
wondering
what
the
deacons
daughter
might
want
of
him
he
went
into
the

there

i
shall
go
out
meanwhile
in
what
way
can
i
be
of
service
to
you
nekhludoff
asked
iii
see
you
are
throwing
away
your
money
on
such
nonsenseon
hunting
began
the
girl
in
great
confusion
i
knowi
only
want
one
thingto
be
of
use
to
the
people
and
i
can
do
nothing
because
i
know
nothing
her
eyes
were
so
truthful
so
kind
and
her
expression
of
resoluteness
and
yet
bashfulness
was
so
touching
that
nekhludoff
as
it
often
happened
to
him
suddenly
felt
as
if
he
were
in
her
position
understood
and
sympathised
what
can
i
do
then
i
am
a
teacher
but
should
like
to
follow
a
course
of
study
and
i
am
not
allowed
to
do
so
that
is
not
that
i
am
not
allowed
to
theyd
allow
me
to
but
i
have
not
got
the
means
give
them
to
me
and
when
i
have
finished
the
course
i
shall
repay
you
i
am
thinking
the
rich
kill
bears
and
give
the
peasants
drink
all
this
is
bad
why
should
they
not
do
good
i
only
want
80
roubles
but
if
you
dont
wish
to
never
mind
she
added
gravely
on
the
contrary
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
this
opportunity



i
will
bring
it
at
once
said
nekhludoff
he
went
out
into
the
passage
and
there
met
one
of
his
comrades
who
had
been
overhearing
his
conversation
paying
no
heed
to
his
chaffing
nekhludoff
got
the
money
out
of
his
bag
and
took
it
to
her
oh
please
do
not
thank
me
it
is
i
who
should
thank
you
he
said
it
was
pleasant
to
remember
all
this
now
pleasant
to
remember
that
he
had
nearly
had
a
quarrel
with
an
officer
who
tried
to
make
an
objectionable
joke
of
it
and
how
another
of
his
comrades
had
taken
his
part
which
led
to
a
closer
friendship
between
them
how
successful
the
whole
of
that
hunting
expedition
had
been
and
how
happy
he
had
felt
when
returning
to
the
railway
station
that
night
the
line
of
sledges
the
horses
in
tandem
glide
quickly
along
the
narrow
road
that
lies
through
the
forest
now
between
high
trees
now
between
low
firs
weighed
down
by
the
snow
caked
in
heavy
lumps
on
their
branches
a
red
light
flashes
in
the
dark
some
one
lights
an
aromatic
cigarette
joseph
a
bear
driver
keeps
running
from
sledge
to
sledge
up
to
his
knees
in
snow
and
while
putting
things
to
rights
he
speaks
about
the
elk
which
are
now
going
about
on
the
deep
snow
and
gnawing
the
bark
off
the
aspen
trees
of
the
bears
that
are
lying
asleep
in
their
deep
hidden
dens
and
his
breath
comes
warm
through
the
opening
in
the
sledge
cover
all
this
came
back
to
nekhludoffs
mind
but
above
all
the
joyous
sense
of
health
strength
and
freedom
from
care
the
lungs
breathing
in
the
frosty
air
so
deeply
that
the
fur
cloak
is
drawn
tightly
on
his
chest
the
fine
snow
drops
off
the
low
branches
on
to
his
face
his
body
is
warm
his
face
feels
fresh
and
his
soul
is
free
from
care

vera
doukhova
was
a
revolutionist
and
imprisoned

chapter
l
the
vicegovernor
of
the
prison
awaking
early
the
next
morning
nekhludoff
remembered
what
he
had
done
the
day
before
and
was
seized
with
fear
but
in
spite
of
this
fear
he
was
more
determined
than
ever
to
continue
what
he
had
begun
conscious
of
a
sense
of
duty
he
left
the
house
and
went
to
see
maslennikoff
in
order
to
obtain
from
him
a
permission
to
visit
maslova
in
prison
and
also
the
menshoffsmother
and
sonabout
whom
maslova
had
spoken
to
him
nekhludoff
had
known
this
maslennikoff
a
long
time
they
had
been
in
the
regiment
together
at
that
time
maslennikoff
was
treasurer
to
the
regiment
he
was
a
kindhearted
and
zealous
officer
knowing
and
wishing
to
know
nothing
beyond
the
regiment
and
the
imperial
family
now
nekhludoff
saw
him
as
an
administrator
who
had
exchanged
the
regiment
for
an
administrative
office
in
the
government
where
he
lived
he
was
married
to
a
rich
and
energetic
woman
who
had
forced
him
to
exchange
military
for
civil
service
she
laughed
at
him
and
caressed
him
as
if
he
were
her
own
pet
animal
nekhludoff
had
been
to
see
them
once
during
the
winter
but
the
couple
were
so
uninteresting
to
him
that
he
had
not
gone
again
at
the
sight
of
nekhludoff
maslennikoffs
face
beamed
all
over
he
had
the
same
fat
red
face
and
was
as
corpulent
and
as
well
dressed
as
in
his
military
days
then
he
used
to
be
always
dressed
in
a
wellbrushed
uniform
made
according
to
the
latest
fashion
tightly
fitting
his
chest
and
shoulders
now
it
was
a
civil
service
uniform
he
wore
and
that
too
tightly
fitted
his
wellfed
body
and
showed
off
his
broad
chest
and
was
cut
according
to
the
latest
fashion
in
spite
of
the
difference
in
age
maslennikoff
was
40
the
two
men
were
very
familiar
with
one
another
halloo
old
fellow
how
good
of
you
to
come
let
us
go
and
see
my
wife
i
have
just
ten
minutes
to
spare
before
the
meeting
my
chief
is
away
you
know
i
am
at
the
head
of
the
government
administration
he
said
unable
to
disguise
his
satisfaction
i
have
come
on
business
what
is
it
said
maslennikoff
in
an
anxious
and
severe
tone
putting
himself
at
once
on
his
guard
there
is
a
person
whom
i
am
very
much
interested
in
in
prison
at
the
word
prison
maslennikoffs
face
grew
stern
and
i
should
like
to
have
an
interview
in
the
office
and
not
in
the
common
visitingroom
i
have
been
told
it
depended
on
you
certainly
mon
cher
said
maslennikoff
putting
both
hands
on
nekhludoffs
knees
as
if
to
tone
down
his
grandeur
but
remember
i
am
monarch
only
for
an
hour
then
will
you
give
me
an
order
that
will
enable
me
to
see
her
its
a
woman
yes
what
is
she
there
for
poisoning
but
she
has
been
unjustly
condemned
yes
there
you
have
it
your
justice
administered
by
jury
ils
nen
font
point
dautres
he
said
for
some
unknown
reason
in
french
i
know
you
do
not
agree
with
me
but
it
cant
be
helped
cest
mon
opinion
bien
arretee
he
added
giving
utterance
to
an
opinion
he
had
for
the
last
twelve
months
been
reading
in
the
retrograde
conservative
paper
i
know
you
are
a
liberal
i
dont
know
whether
i
am
a
liberal
or
something
else
nekhludoff
said
smiling
it
always
surprised
him
to
find
himself
ranked
with
a
political
party
and
called
a
liberal
when
he
maintained
that
a
man
should
be
heard
before
he
was
judged
that
before
being
tried
all
men
were
equal
that
nobody
at
all
ought
to
be
illtreated
and
beaten
but
especially
those
who
had
not
yet
been
condemned
by
law
i
dont
know
whether
i
am
a
liberal
or
not
but
i
do
know
that
however
had
the
present
way
of
conducting
a
trial
is
it
is
better
than
the
old
and
whom
have
you
for
an
advocate
i
have
spoken
to
fanarin
dear
me
fanarin
said
meslennikoff
with
a
grimace
recollecting
how
this
fanarin
had
examined
him
as
a
witness
at
a
trial
the
year
before
and
had
in
the
politest
manner
held
him
up
to
ridicule
for
half
an
hour
i
should
not
advise
you
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
fanarin
est
un
homme
tare
i
have
one
more
request
to
make
said
nekhludoff
without
answering
him
theres
a
girl
whom
i
knew
long
ago
a
teacher
she
is
a
very
pitiable
little
thing
and
is
now
also
imprisoned
and
would
like
to
see
me
could
you
give
me
a
permission
to
visit
her
meslennikoff
bent
his
head
on
one
side
and
considered
shes
a
political
one
yes
i
have
been
told
so
well
you
see
only
relatives
get
permission
to
visit
political
prisoners
still
ill
give
you
an
open
order
je
sais
que
vous
nabuserez
pas
whats
the
name
of
your
protegee
doukhova
elle
est
jolie
hideuse
maslennikoff
shook
his
head
disapprovingly
went
up
to
the
table
and
wrote
on
a
sheet
of
paper
with
a
printed
heading
the
bearer
prince
dmitri
ivanovitch
nekhludoff
is
to
be
allowed
to
interview
in
the
prison
office
the
meschanka
maslova
and
also
the
medical
assistant
doukhova
and
he
finished
with
an
elaborate
flourish
now
youll
be
able
to
see
what
order
we
have
got
there
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
keep
order
it
is
so
crowded
especially
with
people
condemned
to
exile
but
i
watch
strictly
and
love
the
work
you
will
see
they
are
very
comfortable
and
contented
but
one
must
know
how
to
deal
with
them
only
a
few
days
ago
we
had
a
little
troubleinsubordination
another
would
have
called
it
mutiny
and
would
have
made
many
miserable
but
with
us
it
all
passed
quietly
we
must
have
solicitude
on
one
hand
firmness
and
power
on
the
other
and
he
clenched
the
fat
white
turquoiseringed
fist
which
issued
out
of
the
starched
cuff
of
his
shirt
sleeve
fastened
with
a
gold
stud
solicitude
and
firm
power
well
i
dont
know
about
that
said
nekhludoff
i
went
there
twice
and
felt
very
much
depressed
do
you
know
you
ought
to
get
acquainted
with
the
countess
passek
continued
maslennikoff
growing
talkative
she
has
given
herself
up
entirely
to
this
sort
of
work
elle
fait
beaucoup
de
bien
thanks
to
herand
perhaps
i
may
add
without
false
modesty
to
meeverything
has
been
changed
changed
in
such
a
way
that
the
former
horrors
no
longer
exist
and
they
are
really
quite
comfortable
there
well
youll
see
theres
fanarin
i
do
not
know
him
personally
besides
my
social
position
keeps
our
ways
apart
but
he
is
positively
a
bad
man
and
besides
he
takes
the
liberty
of
saying
such
things
in
the
courtsuch
things
well
thank
you
nekhludoff
said
taking
the
paper
and
without
listening
further
he
bade
goodday
to
his
former
comrade
and
wont
you
go
in
to
see
my
wife
no
pray
excuse
me
i
have
no
time
now
dear
me
why
she
will
never
forgive
me
said
maslennikoff
accompanying
his
old
acquaintance
down
to
the
first
landing
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
to
persons
of
not
the
greatest
but
the
second
greatest
importance
with
whom
he
classed
nekhludoff
now
do
go
in
if
only
for
a
moment
but
nekhludoff
remained
firm
and
while
the
footman
and
the
doorkeeper
rushed
to
give
him
his
stick
and
overcoat
and
opened
the
door
outside
of
which
there
stood
a
policeman
nekhludoff
repeated
that
he
really
could
not
come
in
well
then
on
thursday
please
it
is
her
athome
i
will
tell
her
you
will
come
shouted
maslennikoff
from
the
stairs
chapter
li
the
cells
nekhludoff
drove
that
day
straight
from
maslennikoffs
to
the
prison
and
went
to
the
inspectors
lodging
which
he
now
knew
he
was
again
struck
by
the
sounds
of
the
same
piano
of
inferior
quality
but
this
time
it
was
not
a
rhapsody
that
was
being
played
but
exercises
by
clementi
again
with
the
same
vigour
distinctness
and
quickness
the
servant
with
the
bandaged
eye
said
the
inspector
was
in
and
showed
nekhludoff
to
a
small
drawingroom
in
which
there
stood
a
sofa
and
in
front
of
it
a
table
with
a
large
lamp
which
stood
on
a
piece
of
crochet
work
and
the
paper
shade
of
which
was
burnt
on
one
side
the
chief
inspector
entered
with
his
usual
sad
and
weary
look
take
a
seat
please
what
is
it
you
want
he
said
buttoning
up
the
middle
button
of
his
uniform
i

vicegovernors
and
got
this
order
from
him
i
should
like
to
see
the
prisoner
maslova
markova
asked
the
inspector
unable
to
bear
distinctly
because
of
the
music
maslova
well
yes
the
inspector
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
whence
proceeded
clementis
roulades
mary
cant
you
stop
just
a
minute
he
said
in
a
voice
that
showed
that
this
music
was
the
bane
of
his
life
one
cant
hear
a
word
the
piano
was
silent
but
one
could
hear
the
sound
of
reluctant
steps
and
some
one
looked
in
at
the
door
the
inspector
seemed
to
feel
eased
by
the
interval
of
silence
lit
a
thick
cigarette
of
weak
tobacco
and
offered
one
to
nekhludoff
nekhludoff
refused
what
i
want
is
to
see
maslova
oh
yes
that
can
be
managed
now
then
what
do
you
want
he
said
addressing
a
little
girl
of
five
or
six
who
came
into
the
room
and
walked
up
to
her
father
with
her
head
turned
towards
nekhludoff
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
there
now
youll
fall
down
said
the
inspector
smiling
as
the
little
girl
ran
up
to
him
and
not
looking
where
she
was
going
caught
her
foot
in
a
little
rug
well
then
if
i
may
i
shall
go
its
not
very
convenient
to
see
maslova
today
said
the
inspector
hows
that
well
you
know
its
all
your
own
fault
said
the
inspector
with
a
slight
smile
prince
give
her
no
money
into
her
hands
if
you
like

it
me
i
will
keep
it
for
her
you
see

gave
her
some
money
yesterday
she
got
some
spirits
its
an
evil
we
cannot
manage
to
root
out
and
today
she
is
quite
tipsy
even
violent
can
this
be
true
oh
yes
it
is
i
have
even
been
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
severe
measures
and
to
put
her
into
a
separate
cell
she
is
a
quiet
woman
in
an
ordinary
way
but
please
do
not
give
her
any
money
these
people
are
so
what
had
happened
the
day
before
came
vividly
back
to
nekhludoffs
mind
and
again
he
was
seized
with
fear
and
doukhova
a
political
prisoner
might
i
see
her
yes
if
you
like
said
the
inspector
he
embraced
the
little
girl
who
was
still
looking
at
nekhludoff
got
up
and
tenderly
motioning
her
aside
went
into
the
anteroom
hardly
had
he
got
into
the
overcoat
which
the
maid
helped
him
to
put
on
and
before
he
had
reached
the
door
the
distinct
sounds
of
clementis
roulades
again
began
she
entered
the
conservatoire
but
there
is
such
disorder
there
she
has
a
great
gift
said
the
inspector
as
they
went
down
the
stairs
she
means
to
play
at
concerts
the
inspector
and
nekhludoff
arrived
at
the
prison
the
gates
were
instantly
opened
as
they
appeared
the
jailers
with
their
fingers
lifted
to
their
caps
followed
the
inspector
with
their
eyes
four
men
with
their
heads
half
shaved
who
were
carrying
tubs
filled
with
something
cringed
when
they
saw
the
inspector
one
of
them
frowned
angrily
his
black
eyes
glaring
of
course
a
talent
like
that
must
be
developed
it
would
not
do
to
bury
it
but
in
a
small
lodging
you
know
it
is
rather
hard
the
inspector
went
on
with
the
conversation
taking
no
notice
of
the
prisoners
who
is
it
you
want
to
see
doukhova
oh
shes
in
the
tower
youll
have
to
wait
a
little
he
said
might
i
not
meanwhile
see
the
prisoners
menshoff
mother
and
son
who
are
accused
of
incendiarism
oh
yes
cell

21
yes
they
can
be
sent
for
but
might
i
not
see
menshoff
in
his
cell
oh
youll
find
the
waitingroom
more
pleasant
no
i
should
prefer
the
cell
it
is
more
interesting
well
you
have
found
something
to
be
interested
in
here
the
assistant
a
smartlydressed
officer
entered
the
side
door
here
see
the
prince
into
menshoffs
cell
no
21
said
the
inspector
to
his
assistant
and
then
take
him
to
the
office
and
ill
go
and
callwhats
her
name
vera
doukhova
the
inspectors
assistant
was
young
with
dyed
moustaches
and
diffusing
the
smell
of
eaudecologne
this
way
please
he
said
to
nekhludoff
with
a
pleasant
smile
our
establishment
interests
you
yes
it
does
interest
me
and
besides
i
look
upon
it
as
a
duty
to
help
a
man
who
i
heard
was
confined
here
though
innocent
the
assistant
shrugged
his
shoulders
yes
that
may
happen
he
said
quietly
politely
stepping
aside
to
let
the
visitor
enter
the
stinking
corridor
first
but
it
also
happens
that
they
lie
here
we
are
the
doors
of
the
cells
were
open
and
some
of
the
prisoners
were
in
the
corridor
the
assistant
nodded
slightly
to
the
jailers
and
cast
a
side
glance
at
the
prisoners
who
keeping
close
to
the
wall
crept
back
to
their
cells
or
stood
like
soldiers
with
their
arms
at
their
sides
following
the
official
with
their
eyes
after
passing
through
one
corridor
the
assistant
showed
nekhludoff
into
another
to
the
left
separated
from
the
first
by
an
iron
door
this
corridor
was
darker
and
smelt
even
worse
than
the
first
the
corridor
had
doors
on
both
sides
with
little
holes
in
them
about
an
inch
in
diameter
there
was
only
an
old
jailer
with
an
unpleasant
face
in
this
corridor
where
is
menshoff
asked
the
inspectors
assistant
the
eighth
cell
to
the
left
and
these
are
they
occupied
asked
nekhludoff
yes
all
but
one
chapter
lii
no
21
may
i
look
in
asked
nekhludoff
oh
certainly
answered
the
assistant
smiling
and
turned
to
the
jailer
with
some
question
nekhludoff
looked
into
one
of
the
little
holes
and
saw
a
tall
young
man
pacing
up
and
down
the
cell
when
the
man
heard
some
one
at
the
door
he
looked
up
with
a
frown
but
continued
walking
up
and
down
nekhludoff
looked
into
another
hole
his
eye
met
another
large
eye
looking
out
of
the
hole
at
him
and
he
quickly
stepped
aside
in
the
third
cell
he
saw
a
very
small
man
asleep
on
the
bed
covered
head
and
all
with
his
prison
cloak
in
the
fourth
a
broadfaced
man
was
sitting
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
low
down
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
this
man
raised
his
head
and
looked
up
his
face
especially
his
large
eyes
bore
the
expression
of
hopeless
dejection
one
could
see
that
it
did
not
even
interest
him
to
know
who
was
looking
into
his
cell
whoever
it
might
be
he
evidently
hoped
for
nothing
good
from
him
nekhludoff
was
seized
with
dread
and
went
to
menshoffs
cell
no
21
without
stopping
to
look
through
any
more
holes
the
jailer
unlocked
the
door
and
opened
it
a
young
man
with
long
neck
welldeveloped
muscles
a
small
head
and
kind
round
eyes
stood
by
the
bed
hastily
putting
on
his
cloak
and
looking
at
the
newcomers
with
a
frightened
face
nekhludoff
was
specially
struck
by
the
kind
round
eyes
that
were
throwing
frightened
and
inquiring
glances
in
turns
at
him
at
the
jailer
and
at
the
assistant
and
back
again
heres
a
gentleman
wants
to
inquire
into
your
affair
thank
you
kindly
yes
i
was
told
about
you
nekhludoff
said
going
through
the
cell
up
to
the
dirty
grated
window
and
i
should
like
to
hear
all
about
it
from
yourself
menshoff
also
came
up
to
the
window
and
at
once
started
telling
his
story
at
first
looking
shyly
at
the
inspectors
assistant
but
growing
gradually
bolder
when
the
assistant
left
the
cell
and
went
into
the
corridor
to
give
some
order
the
man
grew
quite
bold
the
story
was
told
with
the
accent
and
in
the
manner
common
to
a
most
ordinary
good
peasant
lad
to
hear
it
told
by
a
prisoner
dressed
in
this
degrading
clothing
and
inside
a
prison
seemed
very
strange
to
nekhludoff
nekhludoff
listened
and
at
the
same
time
kept
looking
around
himat
the
low
bedstead
with
its
straw
mattress
the
window
and
the
dirty
damp
wall
and
the
piteous
face
and
form
of
this
unfortunate
disfigured
peasant
in
his
prison
cloak
and
shoes
and
he
felt
sadder
and
sadder
and
would
have
liked
not
to
believe
what
this
goodnatured
fellow
was
saying
it
seemed
too
dreadful
to
think
that
men
could
do
such
a
thing
as
to
take
a
man
dress
him
in
convict
clothes
and
put
him
in
this
horrible
place
without
any
reason
only
because
he
himself
had
been
injured
and
yet
the
thought
that
this
seemingly
true
story
told
with
such
a
goodnatured
expression
on
the
face
might
be
an
invention
and
a
lie
was
still
more
dreadful
this
was
the
story
the
village
publichouse
keeper
had
enticed
the
young
fellows
wife
he
tried
to
get
justice
by
all
sorts
of
means
but
everywhere
the
publichouse
keeper
managed
to
bribe
the
officials
and
was
acquitted
once
he
took
his
wife
back
by
force
but
she
ran
away
next
day
then
he
came
to
demand
her
back
but
though
he
saw
her
when
he
came
in
the
publichouse
keeper
told
him
she
was
not
there
and
ordered
him
to
go
away
he
would
not
go
so
the
publichouse
keeper
and
his
servant
beat
him
so
that
they
drew
blood
the
next
day
a
fire
broke
out
in
the
publichouse
and
the
young
man
and
his
mother
were
accused
of
having
set
the
house
on
fire
he
had
not
set
it
on
fire
but
was
visiting
a
friend
at
the
time
and
it
is
true
that
you
did
not
set
it
on
fire
it
never
entered
my
head
to
do
it
sir
it
must
be
my
enemy
that
did
it
himself
they
say
he
had
only
just
insured
it
then
they
said
it
was
mother
and
i
that
did
it
and
that
we
had
threatened
him
it
is
true
i
once
did
go
for
him
my
heart
couldnt
stand
it
any
longer
can
this
be
true
god
is
my
witness
it
is
true
oh
sir
be
so
good
and
nekhludoff
had
some
difficulty
to
prevent
him
from
bowing
down
to
the
ground
you
see
i
am
perishing
without
any
reason
his
face
quivered
and
he
turned
up
the
sleeve
of
his
cloak
and
began
to
cry
wiping
the
tears
with
the
sleeve
of
his
dirty
shirt
are
you
ready
asked
the
assistant
yes
well
cheer
up
we
will
consult
a
good
lawyer
and
will
do
what
we
can
said
nekhludoff
and
went
out
menshoff
stood
close
to
the
door
so
that
the
jailer
knocked
him
in
shutting
it
and
while
the
jailer
was
locking
it
he
remained
looking
out
through
the
little
hole
chapter
liii
victims
of
government
passing
back
along
the
broad
corridor
it
was
dinner
time
and
the
cell
doors
were
open
among
the
men
dressed
in
their
light
yellow
cloaks
short
wide
trousers
and
prison
shoes
who
were
looking
eagerly
at
him
nekhludoff
felt
a
strange
mixture
of
sympathy
for
them
and
horror
and
perplexity
at
the
conduct
of
those
who
put
and
kept
them
here
and
besides
he
felt
he
knew
not
why
ashamed
of
himself
calmly
examining
it
all
in
one
of
the
corridors
some
one
ran
clattering
with
his
shoes
in
at
the
door
of
a
cell
several
men
came
out
from
here
and
stood
in
nekhludoffs
way
bowing
to
him
please
your
honour
we
dont
know
what
to
call
you
get
our
affair
settled
somehow
i
am
not
an
official
i
know
nothing
about
it
well
anyhow
you
come
from
outside
tell
somebodyone
of
the
authorities
if
need
be
said
an
indignant
voice
show
some
pity
on
us
as
a
human
being
here
we
are
suffering
the
second
month
for
nothing
what
do
you
mean
why
said
nekhludoff
why
we
ourselves
dont
know
why
but
are
sitting
here
the
second
month
yes
its
quite
true
and
it
is
owing
to
an
accident
said
the
inspector
these
people
were
taken
up
because
they
had
no
passports
and
ought
to
have
been
sent
back
to
their
native
government
but
the
prison
there
is
burnt
and
the
local
authorities
have
written
asking
us
not
to
send
them
on
so
we
have
sent
all
the
other
passportless
people
to
their
different
governments
but
are
keeping
these
what
for
no
other
reason
than
that
nekhludoff
exclaimed
stopping
at
the
door
a
crowd
of
about
forty
men
all
dressed
in
prison
clothes
surrounded
him
and
the
assistant
and
several
began
talking
at
once
the
assistant
stopped
them
let
some
one
of
you
speak
a
tall
goodlooking
peasant
a
stonemason
of
about
fifty
stepped
out
from
the
rest
he
told
nekhludoff
that
all
of
them
had
been
ordered
back
to
their
homes
and
were
now
being
kept
in
prison
because
they
had
no
passports
yet
they
had
passports
which
were
only
a
fortnight
overdue
the
same
thing
had
happened
every
year
they
had
many
times
omitted
to
renew
their
passports
till
they
were
overdue
and
nobody
had
ever
said
anything
but
this
year
they
had
been
taken
up
and
were
being
kept
in
prison
the
second
month
as
if
they
were
criminals
we
are
all
masons
and
belong
to
the
same
artel
we
are
told
that
the
prison
in
our
government
is
burnt
but
this
is
not
our
fault
do
help
us
nekhludoff
listened
but
hardly
understood
what
the
goodlooking
old
man
was
saying
because
his
attention
was
riveted
to
a
large
darkgrey
manylegged
louse
that
was
creeping
along
the
goodlooking
mans
cheek
hows
that
is
it
possible
for
such
a
reason
nekhludoff
said
turning
to
the
assistant
yes
they
should
have
been
sent
off
and
taken
back
to
their
homes
calmly
said
the
assistant
but
they
seem
to
have
been
forgotten
or
something
before
the
assistant
had
finished
a
small
nervous
man
also
in
prison
dress
came
out
of
the
crowd
and
strangely
contorting
his
mouth
began
to
say
that
they
were
being
illused
for
nothing
worse
than
dogs
he
began
now
now
not
too
much
of
this
hold
your
tongue
or
you
know
what
do
i
know
screamed
the
little
man
desperately
what
is
our
crime
silence
shouted
the
assistant
and
the
little
man
was
silent
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
nekhludoff
thought
to
himself
as
he
came
out
of
the
cell
while
a
hundred
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
through
the
openings
of
the
cell
doors
and
from
the
prisoners
that
met
him
making
him
feel
as
if
he
were
running
the
gauntlet
is
it
really
possible
that
perfectly
innocent
people
are
kept
here
nekhludoff
uttered
when
they
left
the
corridor
what
would
you
have
us
do
they
lie
so
to
hear
them
talk
they
are
all
of
them
innocent
said
the
inspectors
assistant
but
it
does
happen
that
some
are
really
imprisoned
for
nothing
well
these
have
done
nothing
yes
we
must
admit
it
still
the
people
are
fearfully
spoilt
there
are
such
typesdesperate
fellows
with
whom
one
has
to
look
sharp
today
two
of
that
sort
had
to
be
punished
punished
how
flogged
with
a
birchrod
by
order
but
corporal
punishment
is
abolished
not
for
such
as
are
deprived
of
their
rights
they
are
still
liable
to
it
nekhludoff
thought
of
what
he
had
seen
the
day
before
while
waiting
in
the
hall
and
now
understood
that
the
punishment
was
then
being
inflicted
and
the
mixed
feeling
of
curiosity
depression
perplexity
and
moral
nausea
that
grew
into
physical
sickness
took
hold
of
him
more
strongly
than
ever
before
without
listening
to
the
inspectors
assistant
or
looking
round
he
hurriedly
left
the
corridor
and
went
to
the
office
the
inspector
was
in
the
office
occupied
with
other
business
and
had
forgotten
to
send
for
doukhova
he
only
remembered
his
promise
to
have
her
called
when
nekhludoff
entered
the
office
sit
down
please
ill
send
for
her
at
once
said
the
inspector
chapter
liv
prisoners
and
friends
the
office
consisted
of
two
rooms
the
first
room
with
a
large
dilapidated
stove
and
two
dirty
windows
had
a
black
measure
for
measuring
the
prisoners
in
one
corner
and
in
another
corner
hung
a
large
image
of
christ
as
is
usual
in
places
where
they
torture
people
in
this
room
stood
several
jailers
in
the
next
room
sat
about
twenty
persons
men
and
women
in
groups
and
in
pairs
talking
in
low
voices
there
was
a
writing
table
by
the
window
the
inspector
sat
down
by
the
table
and
offered
nekhludoff
a
chair
beside
him
nekhludoff
sat
down
and
looked
at
the
people
in
the
room
the
first
who
drew
his
attention
was
a
young
man
with
a
pleasant
face
dressed
in
a
short
jacket
standing
in
front
of
a
middleaged
woman
with
dark
eyebrows
and
he
was
eagerly
telling
her
something
and
gesticulating
with
his
hands
beside
them
sat
an
old
man
with
blue
spectacles
holding
the
hand
of
a
young
woman
in
prisoners
clothes
who
was
telling
him
something
a
schoolboy
with
a
fixed
frightened
look
on
his
face
was
gazing
at
the
old
man
in
one
corner
sat
a
pair
of
lovers
she
was
quite
young
and
pretty
and
had
short
fair
hair
looked
energetic
and
was
elegantly
dressed
he
had
fine
features
wavy
hair
and
wore
a
rubber
jacket
they
sat
in
their
corner
and
seemed
stupefied
with
love
nearest
to
the
table
sat
a
greyhaired
woman
dressed
in
black
evidently
the
mother
of
a
young
consumptivelooking
fellow
in
the
same
kind
of
jacket
her
head
lay
on
his
shoulder
she
was
trying
to
say
something
but
the
tears
prevented
her
from
speaking
she
began
several
times
but
had
to
stop
the
young
man
held
a
paper
in
his
hand
and
apparently
not
knowing
what
to
do
kept
folding
and
pressing
it
with
an
angry
look
on
his
face
beside
them
was
a
shorthaired
stout
rosy
girl
with
very
prominent
eyes
dressed
in
a
grey
dress
and
a
cape
she
sat
beside
the
weeping
mother
tenderly
stroking
her
everything
about
this
girl
was
beautiful
her
large
white
hands
her
short
wavy
hair
her
firm
nose
and
lips
but
the
chief
charm
of
her
face
lay
in
her
kind
truthful
hazel
eyes
the
beautiful
eyes
turned
away
from
the
mother
for
a
moment
when
nekhludoff
came
in
and
met
his
look
but
she
turned
back
at
once
and
said
something
to
the
mother
not
far
from
the
lovers
a
dark
dishevelled
man
with
a
gloomy
face
sat
angrily
talking
to
a
beardless
visitor
who
looked
as
if
he
belonged
to
the
scoptsy
sect
at
the
very
door
stood
a
young
man
in
a
rubber
jacket
who
seemed
more
concerned
about
the
impression
he
produced
on
the
onlooker
than
about
what
he
was
saying
nekhludoff
sitting
by
the
inspectors
side
looked
round
with
strained
curiosity
a
little
boy
with
closelycropped
hair
came
up
to
him
and
addressed
him
in
a
thin
little
voice
and
whom
are
you
waiting
for
nekhludoff
was
surprised
at
the
question
but
looking
at
the
boy
and
seeing
the
serious
little
face
with
its
bright
attentive
eyes
fixed
on
him
answered
him
seriously
that
he
was
waiting
for
a
woman
of
his
acquaintance
is
she
then
your
sister
the
boy
asked
no
not
my
sister
nekhludoff
answered
in
surprise
and
with
whom
are
you
here
he
inquired
of
the
boy
i
with
mamma
she
is
a
political
one
he
replied
mary
pavlovna
take
kolia
said
the
inspector
evidently
considering
nekhludoffs
conversation
with
the
boy
illegal
mary
pavlovna
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
attracted
nekhludoffs
attention
rose
tall
and
erect
and
with
firm
almost
manly
steps
approached
nekhludoff
and
the
boy
what
is
he
asking
you
who
you
are
she
inquired
with
a
slight
smile
and
looking
straight
into
his
face
with
a
trustful
look
in
her
kind
prominent
eyes
and
as
simply
as
if
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
she
was
and
must
be
on
sisterly
terms
with
everybody
he
likes
to
know
everything
she
said
looking
at
the
boy
with
so
sweet
and
kind
a
smile
that
both
the
boy
and
nekhludoff
were
obliged
to
smile
back
he
was
asking
me
whom
i
have
come
to
see
mary
pavlovna
it
is
against
the
rules
to
speak
to
strangers
you
know
it
is
said
the
inspector
all
right
all
right
she
said
and
went
back
to
the
consumptive
lads
mother
holding
kolias
little
hand
in
her
large
white
one
while
he
continued
gazing
up
into
her
face
whose
is
this
little
boy
nekhludoff
asked
of
the
inspector
his
mother
is
a
political
prisoner
and
he
was
born
in
prison
said
the
inspector
in
a
pleased
tone
as
if
glad
to
point
out
how
exceptional
his
establishment
was
is
it
possible
yes
and
now
he
is
going
to
siberia
with
her
and
that
young
girl
i
cannot
answer
your
question
said
the
inspector
shrugging
his
shoulders
besides

chapter
lv
vera
doukhova
explains
through
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
room
entered
with
a
wriggling
gait
the
thin
yellow
vera
doukhova
with
her
large
kind
eyes
thanks
for
having
come
she
said
pressing
nekhludoffs
hand
do
you
remember
me
let
us
sit
down
i
did
not
expect
to
see
you
like
this
oh
i
am
very
happy
it
is
so
delightful
so
delightful
that
i
desire
nothing
better
said
vera
doukhova
with
the
usual
expression
of
fright
in
the
large
kind
round
eyes
fixed
on
nekhludoff
and
twisting
the
terribly
thin
sinewy
neck
surrounded
by
the
shabby
crumpled
dirty
collar
of
her
bodice
nekhludoff
asked
her
how
she
came
to
be
in
prison
in
answer
she
began
relating
all
about
her
affairs
with
great
animation
her
speech
was
intermingled
with
a
great
many
long
words
such
as
propaganda
disorganisation
social
groups
sections
and
subsections
about
which
she
seemed
to
think
everybody
knew
but
which
nekhludoff
had
never
heard
of
she
told
him
all
the
secrets
of
the
nardovolstvo
literally
peoples
freedom
a
revolutionary
movement
evidently
convinced
that
he
was
pleased
to
hear
them
nekhludoff
looked
at
her
miserable
little
neck
her
thin
unkempt
hair
and
wondered
why
she
had
been
doing
all
these
strange
things
and
why
she
was
now
telling
all
this
to
him
he
pitied
her
but
not
as
he
had
pitied
menshoff
the
peasant
kept
for
no
fault
of
his
own
in
the
stinking
prison
she
was
pitiable
because
of
the
confusion
that
filled
her
mind
it
was
clear
that
she
considered
herself
a
heroine
and
was
ready
to
give
her
life
for
a
cause
though
she
could
hardly
have
explained
what
that
cause
was
and
in
what
its
success
would
lie
the
business
that
vera
doukhova
wanted
to
see
nekhludoff
about
was
the
following
a
friend
of
hers
who
had
not
even
belonged
to
their
subgroup
as
she
expressed
it
had
been
arrested
with
her
about
five
months
before
and
imprisoned
in
the
petropavlovsky
fortress
because
some
prohibited
books
and
papers
which
she
had
been
asked
to
keep
had
been
found
in
her
possession
vera
doukhova
felt
herself
in
some
measure
to
blame
for
her
friends
arrest
and
implored
nekhludoff
who
had
connections
among
influential
people
to
do
all
he
could
in
order
to
set
this
friend
free
besides
this
doukhova
asked
him
to
try
and
get
permission
for
another
friend
of
hers
gourkevitch
who
was
also
imprisoned
in
the
petropavlovsky
fortress
to
see
his
parents
and
to
procure
some
scientific
books
which
he
required
for
his
studies
nekhludoff
promised
to
do
what
he
could
when
he
went
to
petersburg
as
to
her
own
story
this
is
what
she
said
having
finished
a
course
of
midwifery
she
became
connected
with
a
group
of
adherents
to
the
nardovolstvo
and
made
up
her
mind
to
agitate
in
the
revolutionary
movement
at
first
all
went
on
smoothly
she
wrote
proclamations
and
occupied
herself
with
propaganda
work
in
the
factories
then
an
important
member
having
been
arrested
their
papers
were
seized
and
all
concerned
were
arrested
i
was
also
arrested
and
shall
be
exiled
but
what
does
it
matter
i
feel
perfectly
happy
she
concluded
her
story
with
a
piteous
smile
nekhludoff
made
some
inquiries
concerning
the
girl
with
the
prominent
eyes
vera
doukhova
told
him
that
this
girl
was
the
daughter
of
a
general
and
had
been
long
attached
to
the
revolutionary
party
and
was
arrested
because
she
had
pleaded
guilty
to
having
shot
a
gendarme
she
lived
in
a
house
with
some
conspirators
where
they
had
a
secret
printing
press
one
night
when
the
police
came
to
search
this
house
the
occupiers
resolved
to
defend
themselves
put
out
the
light
and
began
destroying
the
things
that
might
incriminate
them
the
police
forced
their
way
in
and
one
of
the
conspirators
fired
and
mortally
wounded
a
gendarme
when
an
inquiry
was
instituted
this
girl
said
that
it
was
she
who
had
fired
although
she
had
never
had
a
revolver
in
her
hands
and
would
not
have
hurt
a
fly
and
she
kept
to
it
and
was
now
condemned
to
penal
servitude
in
siberia
an
altruistic
fine
character
said
vera
doukhova
approvingly
the
third
business
that
vera
doukhova
wanted
to
talk
about
concerned
maslova
she
knew
as
everybody
does
know
in
prison
the
story
of
maslovas
life
and
his
connection
with
her
and
advised
him
to
take
steps
to
get
her
removed
into
the
political
prisoners
ward
or
into
the
hospital
to
help
to
nurse
the
sick
of
which
there
were
very
many
at
that
time
so
that
extra
nurses
were
needed
nekhludoff
thanked
her
for
the
advice
and
said
he
would
try
to
act
upon

nekhludoff
and
the
prisoners
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
inspector
who
said
that
the
time
was
up
and
the
prisoners
and
their
friends
must
part
nekhludoff
took
leave
of
vera
doukhova
and
went
to
the
door
where
he
stopped
to
watch
what
was
going
on
the
inspectors
order
called
forth
only
heightened
animation
among
the
prisoners
in
the
room
but
no
one
seemed
to
think
of
going
some
rose
and
continued
to
talk
standing
some
went
on
talking
without
rising
a
few
began
crying
and
taking
leave
of
each
other
the
mother
and
her
consumptive
son
seemed
especially
pathetic
the
young
fellow
kept
twisting
his
bit
of
paper
and
his
face
seemed
angry
so
great
were
his
efforts
not
to
be
infected
by
his
mothers
emotion
the
mother
hearing
that
it
was
time
to
part
put
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
sobbed
and
sniffed
aloud

standing
opposite
the
sobbing
mother
and
was
saying
something
to
her
in
a
soothing
tone
the
old
man
with
the
blue
spectacles
stood
holding
his
daughters
hand
and
nodding
in
answer
to
what
she
said

young
lovers
rose
and
holding

looked
silently
into

eyes
these
are
the
only
two
who
are
merry
said
a
young
man
with
a
short
coat
who
stood
by
nekhludoffs
side
also
looking
at
those
who
were
about
to
part

pointed
to

out

with

danced
round

round
again

are
going
to
be
married
here
in

and
she
will
follow

said
the
young
man
what
is
he
a
convict
condemned
to
penal
servitude
let
those
two
at
least
have
a
little
joy
or
else
it
is
too
painful
the
young
man
added
listening
to
the
sobs
of
the
consumptive
lads
mother
now
my
good
people
please
please
do
not
oblige
me
to
have
recourse
to
severe
measures
the
inspector
said
repeating
the
same
words
several
times
over
do
please
he
went
on
in
a
weak
hesitating
manner
it
is
high
time
what
do
you
mean
by
it
this
sort
of
thing
is
quite
impossible
i
am
now
asking
you
for
the
last
time
he
repeated
wearily
now
putting
out
his
cigarette
and
then
lighting
another
it
was
evident
that
artful
old
and
common
as
were
the
devices
enabling
men
to
do
evil
to
others
without
feeling
responsible
for
it
the
inspector
could
not
but
feel
conscious
that
he
was
one
of
those
who
were
guilty
of
causing
the
sorrow
which
manifested
itself
in
this
room
and
it
was
apparent
that
this
troubled
him
sorely
at
length
the
prisoners
and
their
visitors
began
to
gothe

door
the

with
the

passed
out
among

the
consumptive
youth
and
the
dishevelled
man
mary
pavlovna
went
out
with
the
boy
born
in

the
visitors
went
out
too
the
old
man
with
the
blue
spectacles
stepping
heavily
went
out
followed
by
nekhludoff
yes
a
strange
state
of
things
this
said
the
talkative
young
man
as
if
continuing
an
interrupted
conversation
as
he
descended
the
stairs
side
by
side
with
nekhludoff
yet
we
have
reason
to
be
grateful
to
the
inspector
who
does
not
keep
strictly
to
the
rules
kindhearted
fellow
if
they
can
get
a
talk
it
does
relieve
their
hearts
a
bit
after
all
while
talking
to
the
young
man
who
introduced
himself
as
medinzeff
nekhludoff
reached
the
hall
there
the
inspector
came
up
to
them
with
weary
step
if
you
wish
to
see
maslova
he
said
apparently
desiring
to
be
polite
to
nekhludoff
please
come
tomorrow
very
well
answered
nekhludoff
and
hurried
away
experiencing
more
than
ever
that
sensation
of
moral
nausea
which
he
always
felt
on
entering
the
prison
the
sufferings
of
the
evidently
innocent
menshoff
seemed
terrible
and
not
so
much
his
physical
suffering
as
the
perplexity
the
distrust
in
the
good
and
in
god
which
he
must
feel
seeing
the
cruelty
of
the
people
who
tormented
him
without
any
reason
terrible
were
the
disgrace
and
sufferings
cast
on
these
hundreds
of
guiltless
people
simply
because
something
was
not
written
on
paper
as
it
should
have
been
terrible
were
the
brutalised
jailers
whose
occupation
is
to
torment
their
brothers
and
who
were
certain
that
they
were
fulfilling
an
important
and
useful
duty
but
most
terrible
of
all
seemed
this
sickly
elderly
kindhearted
inspector
who
was
obliged
to
part
mother
and
son
father
and
daughter
who
were
just
the
same
sort
of
people
as
he
and
his
own
children
what
is
it
all
for
nekhludoff
asked
himself
and
could
not
find
an
answer

vicegovernors
athome
the
next
day
nekhludoff
went
to
see
the
advocate
and
spoke
to
him
about
the
menshoffs
case
begging
him
to
undertake
their
defence
the
advocate
promised
to
look
into
the
case
and
if
it
turned
out
to
be
as
nekhludoff
said
he
would
in
all
probability
undertake
the
defence
free
of
charge
then
nekhludoff
told
him
of
the
130
men
who
were
kept
in
prison
owing
to
a
mistake
on
whom
did
it
depend
whose
fault
was
it
the
advocate
was
silent
for
a
moment
evidently
anxious
to
give
a
correct
reply
whose
fault
is
it
no
ones
he
said
decidedly
ask
the
procureur
hell
say
it
is
the
governors
ask
the
governor
hell
say
it
is
the

no
one
is
in
fault
i
am
just
going
to
see
the
vicegovernor
i
shall
tell
him
oh
thats
quite
useless
said
the
advocate
with
a
smile
he
is
such
ahe
is
not
a
relation
or
friend
of
yourssuch
a
blockhead
if
i
may
say
so
and
yet
a
crafty
animal
at
the
same
time
nekhludoff
remembered
what
maslennikoff
had
said
about
the
advocate
and
did
not
answer
but
took
leave
and
went
on
to
maslennikoffs
he
had
to
ask
maslennikoff
two
things
about
maslovas
removal
to
the
prison
hospital
and
about
the
130
passportless
men
innocently
imprisoned
though
it
was
very
hard
to
petition
a
man
whom
he
did
not
respect
and
by
whose
orders
men
were
flogged
yet
it
was
the
only
means
of
gaining
his
end
and
he
had
to
go
through
with
it
as
he
drove
up
to
maslennikoffs
house
nekhludoff
saw
a
number
of
different
carriages
by
the
front
door
and
remembered
that
it
was
maslennikoffs
wifes
athome
day
to
which
he
had
been
invited
at
the
moment
nekhludoff
drove
up
there
was
a
carriage
in
front
of
the
door
and
a
footman
in
livery
with
a
cockade
in
his
hat
was
helping
a
lady
down
the
doorstep
she
was
holding
up
her
train
and
showing
her
thin
ankles
black
stockings
and
slippered
feet
among
the
carriages
was
a
closed
landau
which
he
knew
to
be
the
korchagins
the
greyhaired
redchecked
coachman
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
in
a
respectful
yet
friendly
manner
to
nekhludoff
as
to
a
gentleman
he
knew
well
nekhludoff
had
not
had
time
to
inquire
for
maslennikoff
when
the
latter
appeared
on
the
carpeted
stairs
accompanying
a
very
important
guest
not
only
to
the
first
landing
but
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
this
very
important
visitor
a
military
man
was
speaking
in
french
about
a
lottery
for
the
benefit
of
childrens
homes
that
were
to
be
founded
in
the
city
and
expressed
the
opinion
that
this
was
a
good
occupation
for
the
ladies
it
amuses
them
and
the
money
comes

said
the
important
guest
slightly
raising
his
uniformed
shoulders
as
he
presented
them
to
his
own
richly
liveried
servant
to
have
his
military
overcoat
put
on
au

and
he
pressed
maslennikoffs
hand
now
come
up
i
am
so
glad
said
maslennikoff
grasping
nekhludoffs
hand
in
spite
of
his
corpulency
maslennikoff
hurried
quickly
up
the
stairs
he
was
in
particularly
good
spirits
owing
to
the
attention
paid
him
by
the
important
personage
every
such
attention
gave
him
the
same
sense
of
delight
as
is
felt
by
an
affectionate
dog
when
its
master
pats
it
strokes
it
or
scratches
its
ears

wags
its
tail

jumps
about

its
ears
down
and
madly
rushes
about
in
a
circle
maslennikoff
was
ready
to
do
the
same
he
did
not
notice
the
serious
expression
on
nekhludoffs
face
paid
no
heed
to
his
words
but
pulled
him
irresistibly
towards
the
drawingroom
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
nekhludoff
not
to
follow
business
after
wards
i
shall
do
whatever
you
want
said
meslennikoff
as
he
drew
nekhludoff
through
the
dancing
hall
announce

nekhludoff
he
said
to
a
footman
without
stopping
on
his
way
the
footman
started
off
at
a
trot
and
passed
them

on
nekhludoff
at
the
other
end
of
the

several
ladies
were
seated
round
the
teatable
and
some
military
men
and
some
civilians
stood
near
them
the
clatter
of
male
and
female
voices
went
on
unceasingly

but
she
loved
tarts
oh

eternal
silly
jokes
put
in
laughingly
another
lady
resplendent
in
silks
gold
and
jewels
cest
excellent

little
biscuits
and
so

it
must
be
lovely
in
the
country
we
are
having
a
delightful
spring
missy
with
her
hat
on
in
a
darkstriped
dress
of
some
kind
that
fitted
her
like
a
skin
was
looking
very
handsome
she
blushed
when
she
saw
nekhludoff
and
i
thought
you
had
left
she
said
to
him
i
am
on
the
point
of
leaving
business
is
keeping
me
in
town
and

here
wont

come
to
see
mamma
she
would
like
to
see
you
she
said
and
knowing
that
she
was
saying
what
was
not
true
and
that
he
knew
it
also
she
blushed
still
more
i
fear
i
shall
scarcely
have
time
nekhludoff
said
gloomily
trying
to
appear
as
if
he
had
not
noticed
her
blush
missy
frowned
angrily
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turned
towards
an
elegant
officer
who
grasped
the
empty
cup
she
was
holding
and
knocking
his
sword
against
the
chairs
manfully
carried
the
cup
across
to
another
table
you
must
contribute
towards
the
home
fund
i
am
not
refusing
but
only
wish
to
keep
my
bounty
fresh
for
the
lottery
there
i
shall
let
it
appear
in
all
its
glory
well
look
out
for
yourself
said
a
voice
followed
by
an
evidently
feigned
laugh
anna

me
you
are
busying
yourself
with
prison
work
i
can
understand
you
so
well
she
said
to
nekhludoff
micky
she
meant
her
fat
husband
maslennikoff
may
have
other
defects
but
you
know
how
kindhearted
he
is
all
these
miserable
prisoners
are
his
children
he
does
not
regard
them
in
any
other
light
il

dune
bonte
and
she
stopped
finding
no
words
to
do
justice
to
this
bonte
of
his
and
quickly
turned
to
a
shrivelled
old
woman
with
bows
of
lilac
ribbon
all
over
who
came
in
just
then
having
said
as
much
as
was
absolutely
necessary
and
with
as
little
meaning
as
conventionality
required
nekhludoff
rose
and
went
up
to
meslennikoff
can
you
give
me
a
few
minutes
hearing
please
oh
yes
well
what
is
it
let
us
come
in
here
they
entered
a
small
japanese
sittingroom
and
sat
down
by
the
window

you
smoke
but
wait
a
bit
we
must
be
careful
and
not
make
a
mess
here
said
maslennikoff
and
brought
an
ashpan
well
there
are
two
matters
i
wish
to
ask
you
about
dear
me
an
expression
of
gloom
and
dejection
came
over
maslennikoffs
countenance
and
every
trace
of
the
excitement
like
that
of
the
dogs
whom
its
master
has
scratched
behind
the
cars
vanished
completely
the
sound
of
voices
reached
them
from
the
drawingroom
a
womans
voice
was
heard
saying
jamais
je
ne
croirais
and
a
mans
voice
from
the
other
side
relating
something
in
which
the
names
of
la
comtesse
voronzoff
and
victor
apraksine
kept
recurring
a
hum
of
voices
mixed
with
laughter
came
from
another
side
maslennikoff
tried
to
listen
to
what
was
going
on
in
the
drawingroom
and
to
what
nekhludoff
was
saying
at
the
same
time
i
am
again
come
about
that
same
woman
said
nekhludoff
oh
yes
i
know
the
one
innocently
condemned
i
would
like
to
ask
that
she
should
be
appointed
to
serve
in
the
prison
hospital
i
have
been
told
that
this
could
be
arranged
maslennikoff
compressed
his
lips
and
meditated
that
will
be
scarcely
possible
he
said
however
i
shall
see
what
can
be
done
and
shall
wire
you
an
answer
tomorrow
i
have
been
told
that
there
were
many
sick
and
help
was
needed
all
right
all
right
i
shall
let
you
know
in
any
case
please
do
said
nekhludoff
the
sound
of
a
general
and
even
a
natural
laugh
came
from
the
drawingroom
thats
all
that
victor
he
is
wonderfully
sharp
when
he
is
in
the
right
vein
said
maslennikoff
the
next
thing
i
wanted
to
tell
you
said
nekhludoff
is
that
130
persons
are
imprisoned
only
because
their
passports
are
overdue
they
have
been
kept
here
a
month
and
he
related
the
circumstances
of
the
case
how
have
you
come
to
know
of
this
said
maslennikoff
looking
uneasy
and
dissatisfied
i
went
to
see
a
prisoner
and
these
men
came
and
surrounded
me
in
the
corridor
and
asked



what
prisoner
did
you
go
to
see
a
peasant
who
is
kept
in
prison
though
innocent
i
have
put
his
case
into
the
hands
of
a
lawyer
but
that
is
not
the
point
is
it
possible
that
people
who
have
done
no
wrong
are
imprisoned
only
because
their
passports
are
overdue
and



thats
the
procureurs
business
maslennikoff
interrupted
angrily
there
now
you
see
what
it
is
you
call
a
prompt
and
just
form
of
trial
it
is
the
business
of
the
public
prosecutor
to
visit
the
prison
and
to
find
out
if
the
prisoners
are
kept
there
lawfully
but
that
set
play
cards
thats
all
they
do
am
i
to
understand
that
you
can
do
nothing
nekhludoff
said
despondently
remembering
that
the
advocate
had
foretold
that
the
governor
would
put
the
blame
on
the
procureur
oh
yes
i
can
i
shall
see
about
it
at
once
so
much
the
worse
for
her
cest
un
souffre
douleur
came
the
voice
of
a
woman
evidently
indifferent
to
what
she
was
saying
from
the
drawingroom
so
much
the
better
i
shall
take
it
also
a
mans
voice
was
heard
to
say
from
the
other
side
followed
by
the
playful
laughter
of
a
woman
who
was
apparently
trying
to
prevent
the
man
from
taking
something
away
from
her
no
no
not
on
any
account
the
womans
voice
said
all
right
then
i
shall
do
all
this
maslennikoff
repeated
and
put
out
the
cigarette
he
held
in
his
white
turquoiseringed
hand
and
now
let
us
join
the
ladies
wait
a
moment
nekhludoff
said
stopping
at
the
door
of
the
drawingroom
i
was
told
that
some
men
had
received
corporal
punishment
in
the
prison
yesterday
is
this
true
maslennikoff
blushed
oh
thats
what
you
are
after
no
mon
cher
decidedly
it
wont
do
to
let
you
in
there
you
want
to
get
at
everything
come
come
anna
is
calling
us
he
said
catching
nekhludoff
by
the
arm
and
again
becoming
as
excited
as
after
the
attention
paid
him
by
the
important
person
only
now
his
excitement
was
not
joyful
but
anxious
nekhludoff
pulled
his
arm
away
and
without
taking
leave
of
any
one
and
without
saying
a
word
he
passed
through
the
drawingroom
with
a
dejected
look
went
down
into
the
hall
past
the
footman
who
sprang
towards
him
and
out
at
the
street
door
what
is
the
matter
with
him
what
have
you
done
to
him
asked
anna
of
her
husband
this
is
a
la
francaise
remarked
some
one
a
la
francaise
indeedit
is
a
la
zoulou
oh
but
hes
always
been
like
that
some
one
rose
some
one
came
in
and
the
clatter
went
on
its
course
the
company
used
this
episode
with
nekhludoff
as
a
convenient
topic
of
conversation
for
the
rest
of
the
athome
on
the
day
following
his
visit
to
maslennikoff
nekhludoff
received
a
letter
from
him
written
in
a
fine
firm
hand
on
thick
glazed
paper
with
a
coatofarms
and
sealed
with
sealingwax
maslennikoff
said
that
he
had
written
to
the
doctor
concerning
maslovas
removal
to
the
hospital
and
hoped
nekhludoffs
wish
would
receive
attention
the
letter
was
signed
your
affectionate
elder
comrade
and
the
signature
ended
with
a
large
firm
and
artistic
flourish
fool
nekhludoff
could
not
refrain
from
saying
especially
because
in
the
word
comrade
he
felt
maslennikoffs
condescension
towards
him
ie
while
maslennikoff
was
filling
this
position
morally
most
dirty
and
shameful
he
still
thought
himself
a
very
important
man
and
wished
if
not
exactly
to
flatter
nekhludoff
at
least
to
show
that
he
was
not
too
proud
to
call
him
comrade
chapter
lix
nekhludoffs
third
interview
with
maslova
in
prison
one
of
the
most
widespread
superstitions
is
that
every
man
has
his
own
special
definite
qualities
that
a
man
is
kind
cruel
wise
stupid
energetic
apathetic
etc
men
are
not
like
that
we
may
say
of
a
man
that
he
is
more
often
kind
than
cruel
oftener
wise
than
stupid
oftener
energetic
than
apathetic
or
the
reverse
but
it
would
be
false
to
say
of
one
man
that
he
is
kind
and
wise
of
another
that
he
is
wicked
and
foolish
and
yet
we
always
classify
mankind
in
this
way
and
this
is
untrue
men
are
like
rivers
the
water
is
the
same
in
each
and
alike
in
all
but
every
river
is
narrow
here
is
more
rapid
there
here
slower
there
broader
now
clear
now
cold
now
dull
now
warm
it
is
the
same
with
men
every
man
carries
in
himself
the
germs
of
every
human
quality
and
sometimes
one
manifests
itself
sometimes
another
and
the
man
often
becomes
unlike
himself
while
still
remaining
the
same
man
in
some
people
these
changes
are
very
rapid
and
nekhludoff
was
such
a
man
these
changes
in
him
were
due
to
physical
and
to
spiritual
causes
at
this
time
he
experienced
such
a
change
that
feeling
of
triumph
and
joy
at
the
renewal
of
life
which
he
had
experienced
after
the
trial
and
after
the
first
interview
with
katusha
vanished
completely
and
after
the
last
interview
fear
and
revulsion
took
the
place
of
that
joy
he
was
determined
not
to
leave
her
and
not
to
change
his
decision
of
marrying
her
if
she
wished
it
but
it
seemed
very
hard
and
made
him
suffer
on
the
day
after
his
visit
to
maslennikoff
he
again
went
to
the
prison
to
see
her
the
inspector
allowed
him
to
speak
to
her
only
not
in
the
advocates
room
nor
in
the
office
but
in
the
womens
visitingroom
in
spite
of
his
kindness
the
inspector
was
more
reserved
with
nekhludoff
than
hitherto
an
order
for
greater
caution
had
apparently
been
sent
as
a
result
of
his
conversation
with
meslennikoff
you
may
see
her
the
inspector
said
but
please
remember
what
i
said
as
regards
money
and
as
to
her
removal
to
the
hospital
that
his
excellency
wrote
to
me
about
it
can
be
done
the
doctor
would
agree
only
she
herself
does
not
wish
it
she
says
much
need
have
i
to
carry
out
the
slops
for
the
scurvy
beggars
you
dont
know
what
these
people
are
prince
he
added
nekhludoff
did
not
reply
but
asked
to
have
the
interview
the
inspector
called
a
jailer
whom
nekhludoff
followed
into
the
womens
visitingroom
where
there
was
no
one
but
maslova
waiting
she
came
from
behind
the
grating
quiet
and
timid
close
up
to
him
and
said
without
looking
at
him
forgive
me
dmitri
ivanovitch
i
spoke
hastily
the
day
before
yesterday
it
is
not
for
me
to
forgive
you
nekhludoff
began
but
all
the
same
you
must
leave
me
she
interrupted
and
in
the
terribly
squinting
eyes
with
which
she
looked
at
him
nekhludoff
read
the
former
strained
angry
expression
why
should
i
leave
you
so
but
why
so
she
again
looked
up
as
it
seemed
to
him
with
the
same
angry
look
well
then
thus
it
is
she
said
you
must
leave
me
it
is
true
what
i
am
saying
i
cannot
you
just
give
it
up
altogether
her
lips
trembled
and
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
it
is
true
id
rather
hang
myself
nekhludoff
felt
that
in
this
refusal
there
was
hatred
and
unforgiving
resentment
but
there
was
also
something
besides
something
good
this
confirmation
of
the
refusal
in
cold
blood
at
once
quenched
all
the
doubts
in
nekhludoffs
bosom
and
brought
back
the
serious
triumphant
emotion
he
had
felt
in
relation
to
katusha
katusha
what
i
have
said
i
will
again
repeat
he
uttered
very
seriously
i
ask
you
to
marry
me
if
you
do
not
wish
it
and
for
as
long
as
you
do
not
wish
it
i
shall
only
continue
to
follow
you
and
shall
go
where
you
are
taken
that
is
your
business
i
shall
not
say
anything
more
she
answered
and
her
lips
began
to
tremble
again
he
too
was
silent
feeling
unable
to
speak
i
shall
now
go
to
the
country
and
then
to
petersburg
he
said
when
he
was
quieter
again
i
shall
do
my
utmost
to
get
yourour
case
i
mean
reconsidered
and
by
the
help
of
god
the
sentence
may
be
revoked
and
if
it
is
not
revoked
never
mind
i
have
deserved
it
if
not
in
this
case
in
other
ways
she
said
and
he
saw
how
difficult
it
was
for
her
to
keep
down
her
tears
well
have
you
seen
menshoff
she
suddenly
asked
to
hide
her
emotion
its
true
they
are
innocent
isnt
it
yes
i
think
so
such
a
splendid
old
woman
she
said
there
was
another
pause
well
and
as
to
the
hospital
she
suddenly
said
and
looking
at
him
with
her
squinting
eyes
if
you
like
i
will
go
and
i
shall
not
drink
any
spirits
either
nekhludoff
looked
into
her
eyes
they
were
smiling
yes
yes
she
is
quite
a
different
being
nekhludoff
thought
after
all
his
former
doubts
he
now
felt
something
he
had
never
before
experiencedthe
certainty
that
love
is
invincible
when
maslova
returned
to
her
noisome
cell
after
this
interview
she
took
off
her
cloak
and
sat
down
in
her
place
on
the
shelf
bedstead
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
in
the
cell
were
only
the
consumptive
woman
the
vladimir
woman
with
her
baby
menshoffs
old
mother
and
the
watchmans
wife
the
deacons
daughter
had
the
day
before
been
declared
mentally
diseased
and
removed
to
the
hospital
the
rest
of
the
women
were
away
washing
clothes
the
old
woman
was
asleep
the
cell
door
stood
open
and
the
watchmans
children
were
in
the
corridor
outside
the
vladimir
woman
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
and
the
watchmans
wife
with
the
stocking
she
was
knitting
with
deft
fingers
came
up
to
maslova
well
have
you
had
a
chat
they
asked
maslova
sat
silent
on
the
high
bedstead
swinging
her
legs
which
did
not
reach
to
the
floor
whats
the
good
of
snivelling
said
the
watchmans
wife
the
chief
things
not
to
go
down
into
the
dumps
eh
katusha
now
then
and
she
went
on
quickly
moving
her
fingers
maslova
did
not
answer
and
our
women
have
all
gone
to
wash
said
the
vladimir
woman
i
heard
them
say
much
has
been
given
in
alms
today
quite
a
lot
has
been
brought
finashka
called
out
the
watchmans
wife
wheres
the
little
imp
gone
to
she
took
a
knitting
needle
stuck
it
through
both
the
ball
and
the
stocking
and
went
out
into
the
corridor
at
this
moment
the
sound
of
womens
voices
was
heard
from
the
corridor
and
the
inmates
of
the
cell
entered
with
their
prison
shoes
but
no
stockings
on
their
feet
each
was
carrying
a
roll
some
even
two
theodosia
came
at
once
up
to
maslova
whats
the
matter
is
anything
wrong
theodosia
asked
looking
lovingly
at
maslova
with
her
clear
blue
eyes
this
is
for
our
tea
and
she
put
the
rolls
on
a
shelf
why
surely
he
has
not
changed
his
mind
about
marrying
asked
korableva
no
he
has
not
but
i
dont
wish
to
said
maslova
and
so
i
told
him
more

muttered
korableva
in
her
deep
tones
if
ones
not
to
live
together
whats
the
use
of
marrying
said
theodosia
theres
your
husbandhes
going
with
you
said
the
watchmans
wife
well
of
course
were
married
said
theodosia
but
why
should
he
go
through
the
ceremony
if
he
is
not
to
live
with
her
why
indeed
dont
be
a
fool
you
know
if
he
marries
her
shell
roll
in
wealth
said
korableva
he
says
wherever
they
take
you
ill
follow
said
maslova
if
he
does
its
well
if
he
does
not
well
also
i
am
not
going
to
ask
him
to
now
he
is
going
to
try
and
arrange
the
matter
in
petersburg
he
is
related
to
all
the
ministers
there
but
all
the
same
i
have
no
need
of
him
she
continued
of
course
not
suddenly
agreed
korableva
evidently
thinking
about
something
else
as
she
sat
examining
her
bag
well
shall
we
have
a
drop
you
have
some
replied
maslova
i
wont
end
of
book
i
book
ii
chapter
i
property
in
land
it
was
possible
for
maslovas
case
to
come
before
the
senate
in
a
fortnight
at
which
time
nekhludoff
meant
to
go
to
petersburg
and
if
need
be
to
appeal
to
the
emperor
as
the
advocate
who
had
drawn
up
the
petition
advised
should
the
appeal
be
disregarded
and
according
to
the
advocate
it
was
best
to
be
prepared
for
that
since
the
causes
for
appeal
were
so
slight
the
party
of
convicts
among
whom
was
maslova
would
very
likely
leave
in
the
beginning
of
june
in
order
to
be
able
to
follow
her
to
siberia
as
nekhludoff
was
firmly
resolved
to
do
he
was
now
obliged
to
visit
his
estates
and
settle
matters
there
nekhludoff
first
went
to
the
nearest
kousminski
a
large
estate
that
lay
in
the
black
earth
district
and
from
which
he
derived
the
greatest
part
of
his
income
he
had
lived
on
that
estate
in
his
childhood
and
youth
and
had
been
there
twice
since
and
once
at
his
mothers
request
he
had
taken
a
german
steward
there
and
had
with
him
verified
the
accounts
the
state
of
things
there
and
the
peasants
relations
to
the
management
ie
the
landlord
had
therefore
been
long
known
to
him
the
relations
of
the
peasants
to
the
administration
were
those
of
utter
dependence
on
that
management
nekhludoff
knew
all
this
when
still
a
university
student
he
had
confessed
and
preached
henry
georgeism
and
on
the
basis
of
that
teaching
had
given
the
land
inherited
from
his
father
to
the
peasants
it
is
true
that
after
entering
the
army
when
he
got
into
the
habit
of
spending
20000
roubles
a
year
those
former
occupations
ceased
to
be
regarded
as
a
duty
and
were
forgotten
and
he
not
only
left
off
asking
himself
where
the
money
his
mother
allowed
him
came
from
but
even
avoided
thinking
about
it
but
his
mothers
death
the
coming
into
the
property
and
the
necessity
of
managing
it
again
raised
the
question
as
to
what
his
position
in
reference
to
private
property
in
land
was
a
month
before
nekhludoff
would
have
answered
that
he
had
not
the
strength
to
alter
the
existing
order
of
things
that
it
was
not
he
who
was
administering
the
estate
and
would
one
way
or
another
have
eased
his
conscience
continuing
to
live
far
from
his
estates
and
having
the
money
sent
him
but
now
he
decided
that
he
could
not
leave
things
to
go
on
as
they
were
but
would
have
to
alter
them
in
a
way
unprofitable
to
himself
even
though
he
had
all
these
complicated
and
difficult
relations
with
the
prison
world
which
made
money
necessary
as
well
as
a
probable
journey
to
siberia
before
him
therefore
he
decided
not
to
farm
the
land
but
to
let
it
to
the
peasants
at
a
low
rent
to
enable
them
to
cultivate
it
without
depending
on
a
landlord
more
than
once
when
comparing
the
position
of
a
landowner
with
that
of
an
owner
of
serfs
nekhludoff
had
compared
the
renting
of
land
to
the
peasants
instead
of
cultivating
it
with
hired
labour
to
the
old
system
by
which
serf
proprietors
used
to
exact
a
money
payment
from
their
serfs
in
place
of
labour
it
was
not
a
solution
of
the
problem
and
yet
a
step
towards
the
solution
it
was
a
movement
towards
a
less
rude
form
of
slavery
and
it
was
in
this
way
he
meant
to
act
nekhludoff
reached
kousminski
about
noon
trying
to
simplify
his
life
in
every
way
he
did
not
telegraph
but
hired
a
cart
and
pair
at
the
station
the
driver
was
a
young
fellow
in
a
nankeen
coat
with
a
belt
below
his
long
waist
he
was
glad
to
talk
to
the
gentleman
especially
because
while
they
were
talking
his
brokenwinded
white
horse
and
the
emaciated
spavined
one
could
go
at
a
footpace
which
they
always
liked
to
do
the
driver
spoke
about
the
steward
at
kousminski
without
knowing
that
he
was
driving
the
master
nekhludoff
had
purposely
not
told
him
who
he
was
that
ostentatious
german
said
the
driver
who
had
been
to
town
and
read
novels
as
he
sat
sideways
on
the
box
passing
his
hand
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
his
long
whip
and
trying
to
show
off
his
accomplishmentsthat
ostentatious
german
has
procured
three
light
bays
and
when
he
drives
out
with
his
ladyoh
my
at
christmas
he
had
a
christmastree
in
the
big
house
i
drove
some
of
the
visitors
there
it
had
lectric
lights
you
could
not
see
the
like
of
it
in
the
whole
of
the
government
whats
it
to
him
he
has
cribbed
a
heap
of
money
i
heard
say
he
has
bought
an
estate
nekhludoff
had
imagined
that
he
was
quite
indifferent
to
the
way
the
steward
managed
his
estate
and
what
advantages
the
steward
derived
from
it
the
words
of
the
longwaisted
driver
however
were
not
pleasant
to
hear
a
dark
cloud
now
and
then
covered
the
sun
the
larks
were
soaring
above
the
fields
of
winter
corn
the
forests
were
already
covered
with
fresh
young
green
the
meadows
speckled
with
grazing
cattle
and
horses
the
fields
were
being
ploughed
and
nekhludoff
enjoyed
the
lovely
day
but
every
now
and
then
he
had
an
unpleasant
feeling
and
when
he
asked
himself
what
it
was
caused
by
he
remembered
what
the
driver
had
told
him
about
the
way
the
german
was
managing
kousminski
when
he
got
to
his
estate
and
set
to
work
this
unpleasant
feeling
vanished
looking
over
the
books
in
the
office
and
a
talk
with
the
foreman
who
naively
pointed
out
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
the
facts
that
the
peasants
had
very
little
land
of
their
own
and
that
it
lay
in
the
midst
of
the
landlords
fields
made
nekhludoff
more
than
ever
determined
to
leave
off
farming
and
to
let
his
land
to
the
peasants
from
the
office
books
and
his
talk
with
the
foreman
nekhludoff
found
that
twothirds
of
the
best
of
the
cultivated
land
was
still
being
tilled
with
improved
machinery
by
labourers
receiving
fixed
wages
while
the
other
third
was
tilled
by
the
peasants
at
the
rate
of
five
roubles
per
desiatin
about
two
and
threequarter
acres
so
that
the
peasants
had
to
plough
each
desiatin
three
times
harrow
it
three
times
sow
and
mow
the
corn
make
it
into
sheaves
and
deliver
it
on
the
threshing
ground
for
five
roubles
while
the
same
amount
of
work
done
by
wage
labour
came
to
at
least
10
roubles
everything
the
peasants
got
from
the
office
they
paid
for
in
labour
at
a
very
high
price
they
paid
in
labour
for
the
use
of
the
meadows
for
wood
for
potatostalks
and
were
nearly
all
of
them
in
debt
to
the
office
thus
for
the
land
that
lay
beyond
the
cultivated
fields
which
the
peasants
hired
four
times
the
price
that
its
value
would
bring
in
if
invested
at
five
per
cent
was
taken
from
the
peasants
nekhludoff
had
known
all
this
before
but
he
now
saw
it
in
a
new
light
and
wondered
how
he
and
others
in
his
position
could
help
seeing
how
abnormal
such
conditions
are
the
stewards
arguments
that
if
the
land
were
let
to
the
peasants
the
agricultural
implements
would
fetch
next
to
nothing
as
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
even
a
quarter
of
their
value
for
them
and
that
the
peasants
would
spoil
the
land
and
how
great
a
loser
nekhludoff
would
be
only
strengthened
nekhludoff
in
the
opinion
that
he
was
doing
a
good
action
in
letting
the
land
to
the
peasants
and
thus
depriving
himself
of
a
large
part
of
his
income
he
decided
to
settle
this
business
now
at
once
while
he
was
there
the
reaping
and
selling
of
the
corn
he
left
for
the
steward
to
manage
in
due
season
and
also
the
selling
of
the
agricultural
implements
and
useless
buildings
but
he
asked
his
steward
to
call
the
peasants
of
the
three
neighbouring
villages
that
lay
in
the
midst
of
his
estate
kousminski
to
a
meeting
at
which
he
would
tell
them
of
his
intentions
and
arrange
about
the
price
at
which
they
were
to
rent
the
land
with
the
pleasant
sense
of
the
firmness
he
had
shown
in
the
face
of
the
stewards
arguments
and
his
readiness
to
make
a
sacrifice
nekhludoff
left
the
office
thinking
over
the
business
before
him
and
strolled
round
the
house
through
the
neglected
flowergardenthis
year
the
flowers
were
planted
in
front
of
the
stewards
houseover
the
tennis
ground
now
overgrown
with
dandelions
and
along
the
limetree
walk
where
he
used
to
smoke
his
cigar
and
where
he
had
flirted
with
the
pretty
kirimova
his
mothers
visitor
having
briefly
prepared
in
his
mind
the
speech
he
was
going
to
make
to
the
peasants
he
again
went
in
to
the
steward
and
after
tea
having
once
more
arranged
his
thoughts
he
went
into
the
room
prepared
for
him
in
the
big
house
which
used
to
be
a
spare
bedroom
in
this
clean
little
room
with
pictures
of
venice
on
the
walls
and
a
mirror
between
the
two
windows
there
stood
a
clean
bed
with
a
spring
mattress
and
by
the
side
of
it
a
small
table
with
a
decanter
of
water
matches
and
an
extinguisher
on
a
table
by
the
lookingglass
lay
his
open
portmanteau
with
his
dressingcase
and
some
books
in
it
a
russian
book
the
investigation
of
the
laws
of
criminality
and
a
german
and
an
english
book
on
the
same
subject
which
he
meant
to
read
while
travelling
in
the
country
but
it
was
too
late
to
begin
today
and
he
began
preparing
to
go
to
bed
an
oldfashioned
inlaid
mahogany
armchair
stood
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
this
chair
which
nekhludoff
remembered
standing
in
his
mothers
bedroom
suddenly
raised
a
perfectly
unexpected
sensation
in
his
soul
he
was
suddenly
filled
with
regret
at
the
thought
of
the
house
that
would
tumble
to
ruin
and
the
garden
that
would
run
wild
and
the
forest
that
would
be
cut
down
and
all
these
farmyards
stables
sheds
machines
horses
cows
which
he
knew
had
cost
so
much
effort
though
not
to
himself
to
acquire
and
to
keep
it
had
seemed
easy
to
give
up
all
this
but
now
it
was
hard
not
only
to
give
this
but
even
to
let
the
land
and
lose
half
his
income
and
at
once
a
consideration
which
proved
that
it
was
unreasonable
to
let
the
land
to
the
peasants
and
thus
to
destroy
his
property
came
to
his
service
i
must
not
hold
property
in
land
if
i
possess
no
property
in
land
i
cannot
keep
up
the
house
and
farm
and
besides
i
am
going
to
siberia
and
shall
not
need
either
the
house
or
the
estate
said
one
voice
all
this
is
so
said
another
voice
but
you
are
not
going
to
spend
all
your
life
in
siberia
you
may
marry
and
have
children
and
must
hand
the
estate
on
to
them
in
as
good
a
condition
as
you
received
it
there
is
a
duty
to
the
land
too
to
give
up
to
destroy
everything
is
very
easy
to
acquire
it
very
difficult
above
all
you
must
consider
your
future
life
and
what
you
will
do
with
yourself
and
you
must
dispose
of
your
property
accordingly
and
are
you
really
firm
in
your
resolve
and
then
are
you
really
acting
according
to
your
conscience
or
are
you
acting
in
order
to
be
admired
of
men
nekhludoff
asked
himself
all
this
and
had
to
acknowledge
that
he
was
influenced
by
the
thought
of
what
people
would
say
about
him
and
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
questions
arose
and
the
more
unsolvable
they
seemed
in
hopes
of
ridding
himself
of
these
thoughts
by
falling
asleep
and
solving
them
in
the
morning
when
his
head
would
be
fresh
he
lay
down
on
his
clean
bed
but
it
was
long
before
he
could
sleep
together
with
the
fresh
air
and
the
moonlight
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
entered
the
room
mingling
with
the
trills
of
a
couple
of
nightingales
in
the
park
and
one
close
to
the
window
in
a
bush
of
lilacs
in
bloom
listening
to
the
nightingales
and
the
frogs
nekhludoff
remembered
the
inspectors
daughter
and
her
music
and
the
inspector
that
reminded
him
of
maslova
and
how
her
lips
trembled
like
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
when
she
said
you
must
just
leave
it
then
the
german
steward
began
going
down
to
the
frogs
and
had
to
be
held
back
but
he
not
only
went
down
but
turned
into
maslova
who
began
reproaching
nekhludoff
saying
you
are
a
prince
and
i
am
a
convict
no
i
must
not
give
in
thought
nekhludoff
waking
up
and
again
asking
himself
is
what
i
am
doing
right
i
do
not
know
and
no
matter
no
matter
i
must
only
fall
asleep
now
and
he
began
himself
to
descend
where
he
had
seen
the
inspector
and
maslova
climbing
down
to
and
there
it
all
ended
chapter
ii
efforts
at
land
restoration
the
next
day
nekhludoff
awoke
at
nine
oclock
the
young
office
clerk
who
attended
on
the
master
brought
him
his
boots
shining
as
they
had
never
shone
before
and
some
cold
beautifully
clear
spring
water
and
informed
him
that
the
peasants
were
already
assembling
nekhludoff
jumped
out
of
bed
and
collected
his
thoughts
not
a
trace
of
yesterdays
regret
at
giving
up
and
thus
destroying
his
property
remained
now
he
remembered
this
feeling
of
regret
with
surprise
he
was
now
looking
forward
with
joy
to
the
task
before
him
and
could
not
help
being
proud
of
it
he
could
see
from
the
window
the
old
tennis
ground
overgrown
with
dandelions
on
which
the
peasants
were
beginning
to
assemble
the
frogs
had
not
croaked
in
vain
the
night
before
the
day
was
dull
there
was
no
wind
a
soft
warm
rain
had
begun
falling
in
the
morning
and
hung
in
drops
on
leaves
twigs
and
grass
besides
the
smell
of
the
fresh
vegetation
the
smell
of
damp
earth
asking
for
more
rain
entered
in
at
the
window
while
dressing
nekhludoff
several
times
looked
out
at
the
peasants
gathered
on
the
tennis
ground
one
by
one
they
came
took
off
their
hats
or
caps
to
one
another
and
took
their
places
in
a
circle
leaning
on
their
sticks
the
steward
a
stout
muscular
strong
young
man
dressed
in
a
short
peajacket
with
a
green
standup
collar
and
enormous
buttons
came
to
say
that
all
had
assembled
but
that
they
might
wait
until
nekhludoff
had
finished
his
breakfasttea
and
coffee
whichever
he
pleased
both
were
ready
no
i
think
i
had
better
go
and
see
them
at
once
said
nekhludoff
with
an
unexpected
feeling
of
shyness
and
shame
at
the
thought
of
the
conversation
he
was
going
to
have
with
the
peasants
he
was
going
to
fulfil
a
wish
of
the
peasants
the
fulfilment
of
which
they
did
not
even
dare
to
hope
forto
let
the
land
to
them
at
a
low
price
ie
to
confer
a
great
boon
and
yet
he
felt
ashamed
of
something
when
nekhludoff
came
up
to
the
peasants
and
the
fair
the
curly
the
bald
the
grey
heads
were
bared
before
him
he
felt
so
confused
that
he
could
say
nothing
the
rain
continued
to
come
down
in
small
drops
that
remained
on
the
hair
the
beards
and
the
fluff
of
the
mens
rough
coats
the
peasants
looked
at
the
master
waiting
for
him
to
speak
and
he
was
so
abashed
that
he
could
not
speak
this
confused
silence
was
broken
by
the
sedate
selfassured
german
steward
who
considered
himself
a
good
judge
of
the
russian
peasant
and
who
spoke
russian
remarkably
well
this
strong
overfed
man
and
nekhludoff
himself
presented
a
striking
contrast
to
the
peasants
with
their
thin
wrinkled
faces
and
the
shoulder
blades
protruding
beneath
their
coarse
coats
heres
the
prince
wanting
to
do
you
a
favor
and
to
let
the
land
to
you
only
you
are
not
worthy
of
it
said
the
steward
how
are
we
not
worthy
of
it
vasili
karlovitch
dont
we
work
for
you
we
were
well
satisfied
with
the
deceased
ladygod
have
mercy
on
her
souland
the
young
prince
will
not
desert
us
now
our
thanks
to
him
said
a
redhaired
talkative
peasant
yes
thats
why
i
have
called
you
together
i
should
like
to
let
you
have
all
the
land
if
you
wish
it
the
peasants
said
nothing
as
if
they
did
not
understand
or
did
not
believe
it
lets
see
let
us
have
the
land
what
do
you
mean
asked
a
middleaged
man
to
let
it
to
you
that
you
might
have
the
use
of
it
at
a
low
rent
a
very
agreeable
thing
said
an
old
man
if
only
the
pay
is
such
as
we
can
afford
said
another
theres
no
reason
why
we
should
not
rent
the
land
we
are
accustomed
to
live
by
tilling
the
ground
and
its
quieter
for
you
too
that
way
youll
have
to
do
nothing
but
receive
the
rent
only
think
of
all
the
sin
and
worry
now
several
voices
were
heard
saying
the
sin
is
all
on
your
side
the
german
remarked
if
only
you
did
your
work
and
were
orderly
thats
impossible
for
the
likes
of
us
said
a
sharpnosed
old
man
you
say
why
do
you
let
the
horse
get
into
the
corn
just
as
if
i
let
it
in
why
i
was
swinging
my
scythe
or
something
of
the
kind
the
livelong
day
till
the
day
seemed
as
long
as
a
year
and
so
i
fell
asleep
while
watching
the
herd
of
horses
at
night
and
it
got
into
your
oats
and
now
youre
skinning
me
and
you
should
keep
order
its
easy
for
you
to
talk
about
order
but
its
more
than
our
strength
will
bear
answered
a
tall
dark
hairy
middleaged
man
didnt
i
tell
you
to
put
up
a
fence
you
give
us
the
wood
to
make
it
of
said
a
short
plainlooking
peasant
i
was
going
to
put
up
a
fence
last
year
and
you
put
me
to
feed
vermin
in
prison
for
three
months
that
was
the
end
of
that
fence
what
is
it
he
is
saying
asked
nekhludoff
turning
to
the
steward
der
ersto
dieb
im
dorfe
the
greatest
thief
in
the
village
answered
the
steward
in
german
he
is
caught
stealing
wood
from
the
forest
every
year
then
turning
to
the
peasant
he
added
you
must
learn
to
respect
other
peoples
property
why
dont
we
respect
you
said
an
old
man
we
are
obliged
to
respect
you
why
you
could
twist
us
into
a
rope
we
are
in
your
hands
eh
my
friend
its
impossible
to
do
you
its
you
who
are
ever
ready
to
do
us
said
the
steward
do
you
indeed
didnt
you
smash
my
jaw
for
me
and
i
got
nothing
for
it
no
good
going
to
law
with
the
rich
it
seems
you
should
keep
to
the
law
a
tournament
of
words
was
apparently
going
on
without
those
who
took
part
in
it
knowing
exactly
what
it
was
all
about
but
it
was
noticeable
that
there
was
bitterness
on
one
side
restricted
by
fear
and
on
the
other
a
consciousness
of
importance
and
power
it
was
very
trying
to
nekhludoff
to
listen
to
all
this
so
he
returned
to
the
question
of
arranging
the
amount
and
the
terms
of
the
rent
well
then
how
about
the
land
do
you
wish
to
take
it
and
what
price
will
you
pay
if
i
let
you
have
the
whole
of
it
the
property
is
yours
it
is
for
you
to
fix
the
price
nekhludoff
named
the
price
though
it
was
far
below
that
paid
in
the
neighbourhood
the
peasants
declared
it
too
high
and
began
bargaining
as
is
customary
among
them
nekhludoff
thought
his
offer
would
be
accepted
with
pleasure
but
no
signs
of
pleasure
were
visible
one
thing
only
showed
nekhludoff
that
his
offer
was
a
profitable
one
to
the
peasants
the
question
as
to
who
would
rent
the
land
the
whole
commune
or
a
special
society
was
put
and
a
violent
dispute
arose
among
those
peasants
who
were
in
favour
of
excluding
the
weak
and
those
not
likely
to
pay
the
rent
regularly
and
the
peasants
who
would
have
to
be
excluded
on
that
score
at
last
thanks
to
the
steward
the
amount
and
the
terms
of
the
rent
were
fixed
and
the
peasants
went
down
the
hill
towards
their
villages
talking
noisily
while
nekhludoff
and
the
steward
went
into
the
office
to
make
up
the
agreement
everything
was
settled
in
the
way
nekhludoff
wished
and
expected
it
to
be
the
peasants
had
their
land
30
per
cent
cheaper
than
they
could
have
got
it
anywhere
in
the
district
the
revenue
from
the
land
was
diminished
by
half
but
was
more
than
sufficient
for
nekhludoff
especially
as
there
would
be
money
coming
in
for
a
forest
he
sold
as
well
as
for
the
agricultural
implements
which
would
be
sold
too
everything
seemed
excellently
arranged
yet
he
felt
ashamed
of
something
he
could
see
that
the
peasants
though
they
spoke
words
of
thanks
were
not
satisfied
and
had
expected
something
greater
so
it
turned
out
that
he
had
deprived
himself
of
a
great
deal
and
yet
not
done
what
the
peasants
had
expected
the
next
day
the
agreement
was
signed
and
accompanied
by
several
old
peasants
who
had
been
chosen
as
deputies
nekhludoff
went
out
got
into
the
stewards
elegant
equipage
as
the
driver
from
the
station
had
called
it
said
goodbye
to
the
peasants
who
stood
shaking
their
heads
in
a
dissatisfied
and
disappointed
manner
and
drove
off
to
the
station
nekhludoff
was
dissatisfied
with
himself
without
knowing
why
but
all
the
time
he
felt
sad
and
ashamed
of
something

iii
old
associations
from
kousminski
nekhludoff
went
to
the
estate
he
had
inherited
from
his
aunts
the
same
where
he
first
met
katusha
he
meant
to
arrange
about
the
land
there
in
the
way
he
had
done
in
kousminski
besides
this
he
wished
to
find
out
all
he
could
about
katusha
and
her
baby
and
when
and
how
it
had
died
he
got
to
panovo
early
one
morning
and
the
first
thing
that
struck
him
when
he
drove
up
was
the
look
of
decay
and
dilapidation
that
all
the
buildings
bore
especially
the
house
itself
the
iron
roofs
which
had
once
been
painted
green
looked
red
with
rust
and
a
few
sheets
of
iron
were
bent
back
probably
by
a
storm
some
of
the
planks
which
covered
the
house
from
outside
were
torn
away
in
several
places
these
were
easier
to
get
by
breaking
the
rusty
nails
that
held
them
both
porches
but
especially
the
side
porch
he
remembered
so
well
were
rotten
and
broken
only
the
banister
remained
some
of
the
windows
were
boarded
up
and
the
building
in
which
the
foreman
lived
the
kitchen
the
stablesall
were
grey
and
decaying
only
the
garden
had
not
decayed
but
had
grown
and
was
in
full
bloom
from
over
the
fence
the
cherry
apple
and
plum
trees
looked
like
white
clouds
the
lilac
bushes
that
formed
the
hedge
were
in
full
bloom
as
they
had
been
when
14
years
ago
nekhludoff
had
played
gorelki
with
the
15yearold
katusha
and
had
fallen
and
got
his
hand
stung
by
the
nettles
behind
one
of
those
lilac
bushes
the
larch
that
his
aunt
sophia
had
planted
near
the
house
which
then
was
only
a
short
stick
had
grown
into
a
tree
the
trunk
of
which
would
have
made
a
beam
and
its
branches
were
covered
with
soft
yellow
green
needles
as
with
down
the
river
now
within
its
banks
rushed
noisily
over
the
mill

the
meadow
the
other
side
of
the
river
was
dotted
over
by
the

the
foreman
a
student
who
had
left
the
seminary
without
finishing
the
course
met
nekhludoff
in
the
yard
with
a
smile
on
his
face
and
still
smiling
asked
him
to
come
into
the
office
and
as
if
promising
something
exceptionally
good
by
this
smile
he
went
behind
a
partition
for
a
moment
some
whispering
was
heard
behind
the
partition
the
isvostchik
who
had
driven
nekhludoff
from
the
station
drove
away
after
receiving
a
tip
and
all
was
silent
then
a
barefooted
girl
passed
the
window
she
had
on
an
embroidered
peasant
blouse
and
long
earrings
in
her
ears
then
a
man
walked
past
clattering
with
his
nailed
boots
on
the
trodden
path
nekhludoff
sat
down
by
the
little
casement
and
looked
out
into
the
garden
and
listened
a
soft
fresh
spring
breeze
smelling
of
newlydug
earth
streamed
in
through
the
window
playing
with
the
hair
on
his
damp
forehead
and
the
papers
that
lay
on
the
windowsill
which
was
all
cut
about
with
a
knife
trapatrop
trapatrop
comes
a
sound
from
the
river
as
the
women
who
were
washing
clothes
there
slapped
them
in
regular
measure
with
their
wooden
bats
and
the
sound
spread
over
the
glittering
surface
of
the
mill
pond
while
the
rhythmical
sound
of
the
falling
water
came
from
the
mill
and
a
frightened
fly
suddenly
flew
loudly
buzzing
past
his
ear
and
all
at
once
nekhludoff
remembered
how
long
ago
when
he
was
young
and
innocent
he
had
heard
the
womens
wooden
bats
slapping
the
wet
clothes
above
the
rhythmical
sound
from
the
mill
and
in
the
same
way
the
spring
breeze
had
blown
about
the
hair
on
his
wet
forehead
and
the
papers
on
the
windowsill
which
was
all
cut
about
with
a
knife
and
just
in
the
same
way
a
fly
had
buzzed
loudly
past
his
car
it
was
not
exactly
that
he
remembered
himself
as
a
lad
of
15
but
he
seemed
to
feel
himself
the
same
as
he
was
then
with
the
same
freshness
and
purity
and
full
of
the
same
grand
possibilities
for
the
future
and
at
the
same
time
as
it
happens
in
a
dream
he
knew
that
all
this
could
be
no
more
and
he
felt
terribly
sad
at
what
time
would
you
like
something
to
eat
asked
the
foreman
with
a
smile
when
you
like
i
am
not
hungry
i
shall
go
for
a
walk
through
the
village
would
you
not
like
to
come
into
the
house
everything
is
in
order
there
have
the
goodness
to
look
in
if
the
outside
not
now
later
on
tell
me
please
have
you
got
a
woman
here
called
matrona
kharina
this
was
katushas
aunt
the
village
midwife
oh
yes
in
the
village
she
keeps
a
secret
pothouse
i
know
she
does
and
i
accuse
her
of
it
and
scold
her
but
as
to
taking
her
up
it
would
be
a
pity
an
old
woman
you
know
she
has
grandchildren
said
the
foreman
continuing
to
smile
in
the
same
manner
partly
wishing
to
be
pleasant
to
the
master
and
partly
because
he
was
convinced
that
nekhludoff
understood
all
these
matters
just
as
well
as
he
did
himself
where
does
she
live
i
shall
go
across
and
see
her
at
the
end
of
the
village
the
further
side
the
third
from
the
end
to
the
left
there
is
a
brick
cottage
and
her
hut
is
beyond
that
but
id
better
see
you
there
the
foreman
said
with
a
graceful
smile
no
thanks
i
shall
find
it
and
you
be
so
good
as
to
call
a
meeting
of
the
peasants
and
tell
them
that
i
want
to
speak
to
them
about
the
land
said
nekhludoff
with
the
intention
of
coming
to
the
same
agreement
with
the
peasants
here
as
he
had
done
in
kousminski
and
if
possible
that
same
evening
chapter
iv
the
peasants
lot
when
nekhludoff
came
out
of
the
gate
he
met
the
girl
with
the
long
earrings
on
the
welltrodden
path
that
lay
across
the
pasture
ground
overgrown
with
dock
and
plantain
leaves
she
had
a
long
brightlycoloured
apron
on
and
was
quickly
swinging
her
left
arm
in
front
of
herself
as
she
stepped
briskly
with
her
fat
bare
feet
with
her
right
arm
she
was
pressing
a
fowl
to
her
stomach
the
fowl
with
red
comb
shaking
seemed
perfectly
calm
he
only
rolled
up
his
eyes
and
stretched
out
and
drew
in
one
black
leg
clawing
the
girls
apron
when
the
girl
came
nearer
to
the
master
she
began
moving
more
slowly
and
her
run
changed
into
a
walk
when
she
came
up
to
him
she
stopped
and
after
a
backward
jerk
with
her
head
bowed
to
him
and
only
when
he
had
passed
did
she
recommence
to
run
homeward
with
the
cock
as
he
went
down
towards
the
well
he
met
an
old
woman
who
had
a
coarse
dirty
blouse
on
carrying
two
pails
full
of
water
that
hung
on
a
yoke
across
her
bent
back
the
old
woman
carefully
put
down
the
pails
and
bowed
with
the
same
backward
jerk
of
her
head
after
passing
the
well
nekhludoff
entered
the
village
it
was
a
bright
hot
day
and
oppressive
though
only
ten
oclock
at
intervals
the
sun
was
hidden
by
the
gathering
clouds
an
unpleasant
sharp
smell
of
manure
filled
the
air
in
the
street
it
came
from
carts
going
up
the
hillside
but
chiefly
from
the
disturbed
manure
heaps
in
the
yards
of
the
huts
by
the
open
gates
of
which
nekhludoff
had
to
pass
the
peasants
barefooted
their
shirts
and
trousers
soiled
with
manure
turned
to
look
at
the
tall
stout
gentleman
with
the
glossy
silk
ribbon
on
his
grey
hat
who
was
walking
up
the
village
street
touching
the
ground
every
other
step
with
a
shiny
brightknobbed
walkingstick
the
peasants
returning
from
the
fields
at
a
trot
and
jotting
in
their
empty
carts
took
off
their
hats
and
in
their
surprise
followed
with
their
eyes
the
extraordinary
man
who
was
walking
up
their
street
the
women
came
out
of
the
gates
or
stood
in
the
porches
of
their
huts
pointing
him
out
to
each
other
and
gazing
at
him
as
he
passed
when
nekhludoff
was
passing
the
fourth
gate
he
was
stopped
by
a
cart
that
was
coming
out
its
wheels
creaking
loaded
high
with
manure
which
was
pressed
down
and
was
covered
with
a
mat
to
sit
on
a
sixyearold
boy
excited
by
the
prospect
of
a
drive
followed
the
cart
a
young
peasant
with
shoes
plaited
out
of
bark
on
his
feet
led
the
horse
out
of
the
yard
a
longlegged
colt
jumped
out
of
the
gate
but
seeing
nekhludoff
pressed
close
to
the
cart
and
scraping
its
legs
against
the
wheels
jumped
forward
past
its
excited
gentlyneighing
mother
as
she
was
dragging
the
heavy
load
through
the
gateway
the
next
horse
was
led
out
by
a
barefooted
old
man
with
protruding
shoulderblades
in
a
dirty
shirt
and
striped
trousers
when
the
horses
got
out
on
to
the
hard
road
strewn
over
with
bits
of
dry
grey
manure
the
old
man
returned
to
the
gate
and
bowed
to
nekhludoff
you
are
our
ladies
nephew
arent
you
yes
i
am
their
nephew
youve
kindly
come
to
look

the
garrulous
old
man
yes

well
how
are
you
getting
on
how
do
we
get
on
we
get
on
very
badly
the
old
man
drawled
as
if
it
gave
him
pleasure
why
so
badly
nekhludoff
asked
stepping
inside
the
gate
what

our
life
but
the
very
worst
life
said
the
old
man
following
nekhludoff
into
that
part
of
the
yard
which
was
roofed
over
nekhludoff
stopped
under
the
roof

12
of

continued
the
old
man
pointing
to
two
women
on
the
remainder
of
the
manure
heap
who
stood
perspiring
with
forks
in
their
hands
the
kerchiefs
tumbling
off
their
heads
with
their
skirts
tucked
up
showing
the
calves
of
their
dirty
bare
legs
not

corn
of

repeated
the
old
man
with
a
smile
of
contempt
why
i
have
only

for

and

all

go
into
your
hut
asked
nekhludoff
stepping
across
the
yard
over
the
yellowbrown
layers
of
manure
that
had
been
raked
up
by
the
forks
and
were
giving
off
a
strong
smell
why
not
come
in
said
the
old
man
and
stepping
quickly
with
his
bare
feet
over
the
manure
the
liquid
oozing
between
his
toes
he
passed
nekhludoff
and
opened
the
door
of
the
hut
the
women
arranged
the
kerchiefs
on
their
heads
and
let
down
their
skirts
and
stood
looking
with
surprise
at
the
clean
gentleman
with
gold
studs
to
his
sleeves
who
was
entering
their
house
two
little
girls
with
nothing
on
but
coarse
chemises
rushed
out
of
the
hut
nekhludoff
took
off
his
hat
and
stooping
to
get
through
the
low
door
entered
through
a
passage
into
the
dirty
narrow
hut
that
smelt
of
sour
food
and
where
much
space
was
taken
up
by
two
weaving
looms
in
the
hut
an
old
woman
was
standing
by
the
stove
with
the
sleeves
rolled
up
over
her
thin
sinewy
brown
arms
here

brisk

her
head

said
the
old
woman
looking
towards
the
door
the
door
stood
open
and
the
passage
outside
was
full
of
peopleboys
girls
women
with
babiesthronged
together
to
look
at
the
strange
gentleman
who
wanted
to
see
the
peasants
food
the
old
woman
seemed
to
pride
herself
on
the
way
she
behaved
with
a
gentleman
yes
its
a
miserable
life

said
the
old
man
what
are

doing
there
he
shouted
to
those
in
the
passage
well
goodbye
said
nekhludoff
feeling
ashamed
and
uneasy
though
unable
to
account
for
the
feeling
thank
you
kindly
for
having
looked
us
up
said
the
old
man
the
people
in
the
passage
pressed
closer
together
to
let
nekhludoff
pass
and
he
went
out
and
continued
his
way
up
the
street
two
barefooted
boys
followed
him
out
of
the
passage
the
elder
in
a
shirt
that
had
once
been
white
the
other
in
a
worn
and
faded
pink
one
nekhludoff
looked
back
at
them
and
where
are

asked
the
boy
with
the
white
shirt
nekhludoff
answered
to
matrona
kharina
do
you
know
her
the
boy
with
the
pink
shirt
began
laughing
at
something
but
the
elder
asked
seriously
what
matrona
is
that
is
she
old
yes

ohoh
he
drawled

and
all
three
went
up
the
street
chapter
v
maslovas
aunt
nekhludoff
felt
more
at
ease
with
the
boys
than
with
the
grownup
people
and
he
began
talking
to
them
as
they
went
along
the
little
one
with
the
pink
shirt
stopped
laughing
and
spoke
as
sensibly
and
as
exactly
as
the
elder
one
can
you
tell
me
who

the
poorest
people

the
elder
boy

boy
said
standing
up
for
anisia

the

boy
shes
also
no
husband
and
where
is
her
husband
nekhludoff
asked
feeding
vermin
in
prison
said
the
elder
boy
using
this
expression
common
among
the
peasants
a
year
ago
he
cut
down
two
birch
trees
in
the
landlords
forest
the
little
pink
boy
hurried
to
say
so
he
was
locked
up
now
hes
sitting
the
sixth
month
there
and
the
wife
goes
begging
there
are
three
children
and
a
sick
grandmother
he
went
on
with
his
detailed
account
and
where
does
she
live
nekhludoff
asked
in
this
very
house
answered
the
boy
pointing
to
a
hut
in
front
of
which
on
the
footpath
along
which
nekhludoff
was
walking
a
tiny
flaxenheaded
infant
stood
balancing
himself
with
difficulty
on
his
rickety
legs
vaska
wheres
the
little
scamp
got
to
shouted
a
woman
with
a
dirty
grey
blouse
and
a
frightened
look
as
she
ran
out
of
the
house
and
rushing
forward
seized
the
baby
before
nekhludoff
came
up
to
it
and
carried
it
in
just
as
if
she
were
afraid
that
nekhludoff
would
hurt
her
child
this
was
the
woman
whose
husband
was
imprisoned
for
nekhludoffs
birch
trees
well
and
this
matrona
is
she
also
poor
nekhludoff
asked
as
they
came
up
to
matronas
house
she
poor
no
why
she
sells
spirits
the
thin
pink
little
boy
answered
decidedly
when
they
reached
the
house
nekhludoff
left
the
boys
outside
and
went
through
the
passage
into
the
hut
the
hut
was
14
feet
long
the
bed
that
stood
behind
the
big
stove
was
not
long
enough
for
a
tall
person
to
stretch
out
on
and
on
this
very
bed
nekhludoff
thought
katusha
bore
her
baby
and
lay
ill
afterwards
the
greater
part
of
the
hut
was
taken
up
by
a
loom
on
which
the
old
woman
and
her
eldest
granddaughter
were
arranging
the
warp
when
nekhludoff
came
in
striking
his
forehead
against
the
low
doorway
two
other
grandchildren
came
rushing
in
after
nekhludoff
and
stopped
holding
on
to
the
lintels
of
the
door
whom
do
you
want
asked
the
old
woman
crossly
she
was
in
a
bad
temper
because
she
could
not
manage
to
get
the
warp
right
and
besides
carrying
on
an
illicit
trade
in
spirits
she
was
always
afraid
when
any
stranger
came
in
i
amthe
owner
of
the
neighbouring
estates
and
should
like
to
speak
to
you
dear
me
why
its
you
my
honey
and
i
fool
thought
it
was
just
some
passerby
dear
me
youits
you
my
precious
said
the
old
woman
with
simulated
tenderness
in
her
voice
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
alone
said
nekhludoff
with
a
glance
towards
the
door
where
the
children
were
standing
and
behind
them
a
woman
holding
a
wasted
pale
baby
with
a
sickly
smile
on
its
face
who
had
a
little
cap
made
of
different
bits
of
stuff
on
its
head
what
are
you
staring
at
ill
give
it
you
just
hand
me
my
crutch
the
old
woman
shouted
to
those
at
the
door
shut
the
door
will
you
the
children
went
away
and
the
woman
closed
the
door
and
i
was
thinking
whos
that
and
its
the
master
himself
my
jewel
my
treasure
just
think
said
the
old
woman
where
he
has
deigned
to
come
sit
down
here
your
honour
she
said
wiping
the
seat
with
her
apron
and
i
was
thinking
what
devil
is
it
coming
in
and
its
your
honour
the
master
himself
the
good
gentleman
our
benefactor
forgive
me
old
fool
that
i
am
im
getting
blind
nekhludoff
sat
down
and
the
old
woman
stood
in
front
of
him
leaning
her
cheek
on
her
right
hand
while
the
left
held
up
the
sharp
elbow
of
her
right
arm
dear
me
you
have
grown
old
your
honour
and
you
used
to
be
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
and
now
cares
also
i
expect
this
is
what
i
have
come
about
do
you
remember
katusha
maslova
katerina
i
should
think
so
why
she
is
my
niece
how
could
i
help
remembering
and
the
tears
i
have
shed
because
of
her
why
i
know
all
about
it
eh
sir
who
has
not
sinned
before
god
who
has
not
offended
against
the
tsar
we
know
what
youth
is
you
used
to
be
drinking
tea
and
coffee
so
the
devil
got
hold
of
you
he
is
strong
at
times
whats
to
be
done
now
if
you
had
chucked
her
but
no
just
see
how
you
rewarded
her
gave
her
a
hundred
roubles
and
she
what
has
she
done
had
she
but
listened
to
me
she
might
have
lived
all
right
i
must
say
the
truth
though
she
is
my
niece
that
girls
no
good
what
a
good
place
i
found
her
she
would
not
submit
but
abused
her
master
is
it
for
the
likes
of
us
to
scold
gentlefolk
well
she
was
sent
away
and
then
at
the
foresters
she
might
have
lived
there
but
no
she
would
not
i
want
to
know
about
the
child
she
was
confined
at
your
house
was
she
not
wheres
the
child
as
to
the
child
i
considered
that
well
at
the
time
she
was
so
bad
i
never
thought
she
would
get
up
again
well
so
i
christened
the
baby
quite
properly
and
we
sent
it
to
the
foundlings
why
should
one
let
an
innocent
soul
languish
when
the
mother
is
dying
others
do
like
this
they
just
leave
the
baby
dont
feed
it
and
it
wastes
away
but
thinks
i
no
id
rather
take
some
trouble
and
send
it
to
the
foundlings
there
was
money
enough
so
i
sent
it
off
did
you
not
get
its
registration
number
from
the
foundlings
hospital
yes
there
was
a
number
but
the
baby
died
she
said
it
died
as
soon
as
she
brought
it
there
who
is
she
that
same
woman
who
used
to
live
in
skorodno
she
made
a
business
of
it
her
name
was
malania
shes
dead
now
she
was
a
wise
woman
what

was
it
a
fine
baby
nekhludoff
asked
such
a
baby
that
if
you
wanted
a
finer
you
could
not
find
one
your
very
image
the
old
woman
added
with
a
wink
why
did
it
sicken
was
the
food
bad
eh
what
food
only
just

of

there
it
died
she
brought
a
certificateall
in

she
was
such
a
wise
woman
that
was

nekhludoff
could
find
out
concerning
his
child
chapter
vi
reflections
of
a
landlord
again
striking
his
head
against
both
doors
nekhludoff
went
out
into
the
street
where
the
pink
and
the
white
boys
were
waiting
for
him
a
few
newcomers
were
standing
with
them
among
the
women
of
whom
several
had
babies
in
their
arms
was
the
thin
woman
with
the
baby
who
had
the
patchwork
cap
on
its
head
she
held
lightly
in
her
arms
the
bloodless
infant
who
kept
strangely
smiling
all
over
its
wizened
little
face
and
continually
moving
its
crooked
thumbs
nekhludoff
knew
the
smile
to
be
one
of
suffering
he
asked
who
the
woman
was
it
is
that
very
anisia
i
told
you
about
said
the
elder
boy
nekhludoff
turned
to
anisia
how
do
you
live
he
asked
by
what
means
do
you
gain
your
livelihood
how
do
i
live
i
go
begging
said
anisia
and
began
to
cry
nekhludoff
took
out
his
pocketbook
and
gave
the
woman
a
10rouble
note
he
had
not
had
time
to
take
two
steps
before
another
woman
with
a
baby
caught
him
up
then
an
old
woman
then
another
young
one
all
of
them
spoke
of
their
poverty
and
asked
for
help
nekhludoff
gave
them
the
60
roublesall
in
small
noteswhich
he
had
with
him
and
terribly
sad
at
heart
turned
home
ie
to
the
foremans
house
the
foreman
met
nekhludoff
with
a
smile
and
informed
him
that
the
peasants
would
come
to
the
meeting
in
the
evening
nekhludoff
thanked
him
and
went
straight
into
the
garden
to
stroll
along
the
paths
strewn
over
with
the
petals
of
appleblossom
and
overgrown
with
weeds
and
to
think
over
all
he
had
seen
at
first
all
was
quiet
but
soon
nekhludoff
heard
from
behind
the
foremans
house
two
angry
womens
voices
interrupting
each
other
and
now
and
then
the
voice
of
the
eversmiling
foreman
nekhludoff
listened
my
strengths
at
an
end
what
are
you
about
dragging
the
very
cross
those
baptized
in
the
russogreek
church
always
wear
a
cross
round
their
necks
off
my
neck
said
an
angry
womans
voice
but
she
only
got
in
for
a
moment
said
another
voice
give
it
her
back
i
tell
you
why
do
you
torment
the
beast
and
the
children
too
who
want
their
milk
pay
then
or
work
it
off
said
the
foremans
voice
nekhludoff
left
the
garden
and
entered
the
porch
near
which
stood
two
dishevelled
womenone
of
them
pregnant
and
evidently
near
her
time
on
one
of
the
steps
of
the
porch
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
holland
coat
stood
the
foreman
when
they
saw
the
master
the
women
were
silent
and
began
arranging
the
kerchiefs
on
their
heads
and
the
foreman
took
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
and
began
to
smile
this
is
what
had
happened
from
the
foremans
words
it
seemed
that
the
peasants
were
in
the
habit
of
letting
their
calves
and
even
their
cows
into
the
meadow
belonging
to
the
estate
two
cows
belonging
to
the
families
of
these
two
women
were
found
in
the
meadow
and
driven
into
the
yard
the
foreman
demanded
from
the
women
30
copecks
for
each
cow
or
two
days
work
the
women
however
maintained
that
the
cows
had
got
into
the
meadow
of
their
own
accord
that
they
had
no
money
and
asked
that
the
cows
which
had
stood
in
the
blazing
sun
since
morning
without
food
piteously
lowing
should
be
returned
to
them
even
if
it
had
to
be
on
the
understanding
that
the
price
should
be
worked
off
later
on
how
often
have
i
not
begged
of
you
said
the
smiling
foreman
looking
back
at
nekhludoff
as
if
calling
upon
him
to
be
a
witness
if
you
drive
your
cattle
home
at
noon
that
you
should
have
an
eye
on
them
i
only
ran
to
my
little
one
for
a
bit
and
they
got
away
dont
run
away
when
you
have
undertaken
to
watch
the
cows
and
whos
to
feed
the
little
one
youd
not
give
him
the
breast
i
suppose
said
the
other
woman
now
if
they
had
really
damaged
the
meadow
one
would
not
take
it
so
much
to
heart
but
they
only
strayed
in
a
moment
all
the
meadows
are
damaged
the
foreman
said
turning
to
nekhludoff
if
i
exact
no
penalty
there
will
be
no
hay
there
now
dont
go
sinning
like
that
my
cows
have
never
been
caught
there
before
shouted
the
pregnant
woman
now
that
one
has
been
caught
pay
up
or
work
it
off
all
right
ill
work
it
off
only
let
me
have
the
cow
now
dont
torture
her
with
hunger
she
cried
angrily
as
it
is
i
have
no
rest
day
or
night
motherinlaw
is
ill
husband
taken
to
drink
im
all
alone
to
do
all
the
work
and
my
strengths
at
an
end
i
wish
youd
choke
you
and
your
working
it
off
nekhludoff
asked
the
foreman
to
let
the
women
take
the
cows
and
went
back
into
the
garden
to
go
on
thinking
out
his
problem
but
there
was
nothing
more
to
think
about
everything
seemed
so
clear
to
him
now
that
he
could
not
stop
wondering
how
it
was
that
everybody
did
not
see
it
and
that
he
himself
had
for
such
a
long
while
not
seen
what
was
so
clearly
evident
the
people
were
dying
out
and
had
got
used
to
the
dyingout
process
and
had
formed
habits
of
life
adapted
to
this
process
there
was
the
great
mortality
among
the
children
the
overworking
of
the
women
the
underfeeding
especially
of
the
aged
and
so
gradually
had
the
people
come
to
this
condition
that
they
did
not
realise
the
full
horrors
of
it
and
did
not
complain
therefore
we
consider
their
condition
natural
and
as
it
should
be
now
it
seemed
as
clear
as
daylight
that
the
chief
cause
of
the
peoples
great
want
was
one
that
they
themselves
knew
and
always
pointed
out
ie
that
the
land
which
alone
could
feed
them
had
been
taken
from
them
by
the
landlords
and
how
evident
it
was
that
the
children
and
the
aged
died
because
they
had
no
milk
and
they
had
no
milk
because
there
was
no
pasture
land
and
no
land
to
grow
corn
or
make
hay
on
it
was
quite
evident
that
all
the
misery
of
the
people
or
at
least
by
far
the
greater
part
of
it
was
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
land
which
should
feed
them
was
not
in
their
hands
but
in
the
hands
of
those
who
profiting
by
their
rights
to
the
land
live
by
the
work
of
these
people
the
land
so
much
needed
by
men
was
tilled
by
these
people
who
were
on
the
verge
of
starvation
so
that
the
corn
might
be
sold
abroad
and
the
owners
of
the
land
might
buy
themselves
hats
and
canes
and
carriages
and
bronzes
etc
he
understood
this
as
clearly
as
he
understood
that
horses
when
they
have
eaten
all
the
grass
in
the
inclosure
where
they
are
kept
will
have
to
grow
thin
and
starve
unless
they
are
put
where
they
can
get
food
off
other
land
this
was
terrible
and
must
not
go
on
means
must
be
found
to
alter
it
or
at
least
not
to
take
part
in
it
and
i
will
find
them
he
thought
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
path
under
the
birch
trees
in
scientific
circles
government
institutions
and
in
the
papers
we
talk
about
the
causes
of
the
poverty
among
the
people
and
the
means
of
ameliorating
their
condition
but
we
do
not
talk
of
the
only
sure
means
which
would
certainly
lighten
their
condition
ie
giving
back
to
them
the
land
they
need
so
much
henry
georges
fundamental
position
recurred
vividly
to
his
mind
and
how
he
had
once
been
carried
away
by
it
and
he
was
surprised
that
he
could
have
forgotten
it
the
earth
cannot
be
any
ones
property
it
cannot
be
bought
or
sold
any
more
than
water
air
or
sunshine
all
have
an
equal
right
to
the
advantages
it
gives
to
men
and
now
he
knew
why
he
had
felt
ashamed
to
remember
the
transaction
at
kousminski
he
had
been
deceiving
himself
he
knew
that
no
man
could
have
a
right
to
own
land
yet
he
had
accepted
this
right
as
his
and
had
given
the
peasants
something
which
in
the
depth
of
his
heart
he
knew
he
had
no
right
to
now
he
would
not
act
in
this
way
and
would
alter
the
arrangement
in
kousminski
also
and
he
formed
a
project
in
his
mind
to
let
the
land
to
the
peasants
and
to
acknowledge
the
rent
they
paid
for
it
to
be
their
property
to
be
kept
to
pay
the
taxes
and
for
communal
uses
this
was
of
course
not
the
singletax
system
still
it
was
as
near
an
approach
to
it
as
could
be
had
under
existing
circumstances
his
chief
consideration
however
was
that
in
this
way
he
would
no
longer
profit
by
the
possession
of
landed
property
when
he
returned
to
the
house
the
foreman
with
a
specially
pleasant
smile
asked
him
if
he
would
not
have
his
dinner
now
expressing
the
fear
that
the
feast
his
wife
was
preparing
with
the
help
of
the
girl
with
the
earrings
might
be
overdone
the
table
was
covered
with
a
coarse
unbleached
cloth
and
an
embroidered
towel
was
laid
on
it
in
lieu
of
a
napkin
a

soup
tureen
with
a
broken
handle
stood
on
the
table
full
of

stock
made
of
the
fowl
that
had
put
out
and
drawn
in
his
black
leg
and
was
now
cut
or
rather
chopped
in
pieces
which
were
here
and
there
covered
with
hairs
after
the
soup
more
of
the
same
fowl
with
the
hairs
was
served
roasted
and
then

very
greasy

with
a
great
deal
of
sugar
little
appetising
as
all
this
was
nekhludoff
hardly
noticed
what
he
was
eating
he
was
occupied
with
the
thought
which
had
in
a
moment
dispersed
the
sadness
with
which
he
had
returned
from
the
village
the
foremans
wife
kept
looking
in
at
the
door
whilst
the
frightened
maid
with
the
earrings
brought
in
the
dishes
and
the
foreman
smiled
more
and
more
joyfully
priding
himself
on
his
wifes
culinary
skill
after
dinner
nekhludoff
succeeded
with
some
trouble
in
making
the
foreman
sit
down
in
order
to
revise
his
own
thoughts
and
to
express
them
to
some
one
he
explained
his
project
of
letting
the
land
to
the
peasants
and
asked
the
foreman
for
his
opinion
the
foreman
smiling
as
if
he
had
thought
all
this
himself
long
ago
and
was
very
pleased
to
hear
it
did
not
really
understand
it
at
all
this
was
not
because
nekhludoff
did
not
express
himself
clearly
but
because
according
to
this
project
it
turned
out
that
nekhludoff
was
giving
up
his
own
profit
for
the
profit
of
others
and
the
thought
that
every
one
is
only
concerned
about
his
own
profit
to
the
harm
of
others
was
so
deeply
rooted
in
the
foremans
conceptions
that
he
imagined
he
did
not
understand
something
when
nekhludoff
said
that
all
the
income
from
the
land
must
be
placed
to
form
the
communal
capital
of
the
peasants
oh
i
see
then
you
of
course
will
receive
the
percentages
from
that
capital
said
the
foreman
brightening
up
dear
me
no
dont
you
see
i
am
giving
up
the
land
altogether
but
then
you
will
not
get
any
income
said
the
foreman
smiling
no
longer
yes
i
am
going
to
give
it
up
the
foreman
sighed
heavily
and
then
began
smiling
again
now
he
understood
he
understood
that
nekhludoff
was
not
quite
normal
and
at
once
began
to
consider
how
he
himself
could
profit
by
nekhludoffs
project
of
giving
up
the
land
and
tried
to
see
this
project
in
such
a
way
that
he
might
reap
some
advantage
from
it
but
when
he
saw
that
this
was
impossible
he
grew
sorrowful
and
the
project
ceased
to
interest
him
and
he
continued
to
smile
only
in
order
to
please
the
master
seeing
that
the
foreman
did
not
understand
him
nekhludoff
let
him
go
and
sat
down
by
the
windowsill
that
was
all
cut
about
and
inked
over
and
began
to
put
his
project
down
on
paper
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
limes
that
were
covered
with
fresh
green
and
the
mosquitoes
swarmed
in
stinging
nekhludoff
just
as
he
finished
his
notes
he
heard
the
lowing
of
cattle
and
the
creaking
of
opening
gates
from
the
village
and
the
voices
of
the
peasants
gathering
together
for
the
meeting
he
told
the
foreman
not
to
call
the
peasants
up
to
the
office
as
he
meant
to
go
into
the
village
himself
and
meet
the
men
where
they
would
assemble
having
hurriedly
drank
a
cup
of
tea
offered
him
by
the
foreman
nekhludoff
went
to
the
village
chapter
vii
the
disinherited
from
the
crowd
assembled
in
front
of
the
house
of
the
village
elder
came
the
sound
of
voices
but
as
soon
as
nekhludoff
came
up
the
talking
ceased
and
all
the
peasants
took
off
their
caps
just
as
those
in
kousminski
had
done
the
peasants
here
were
of
a
much
poorer
class
than
those
in
kousminski
the
men
wore
shoes
made
of
bark
and
homespun
shirts
and
coats
some
had
come
straight
from
their
work
in
their
shirts
and
with
bare
feet
nekhludoff
made
an
effort
and
began
his
speech
by
telling
the
peasants
of
his
intention
to
give
up
his
land
to
them
altogether
the
peasants
were
silent
and
the
expression
on
their
faces
did
not
undergo
any
change
because
i
hold
said
nekhludoff
and
believe
that
every
one
has
a
right
to
the
use
of
the
land
thats
certain
thats
so
exactly
said
several
voices
nekhludoff
went
on
to
say
that
the
revenue
from
the
land
ought
to
be
divided
among
all
and
that
he
would
therefore
suggest
that
they
should
rent
the
land
at
a
price
fixed
by
themselves
the
rent
to
form
a
communal
fund
for
their
own
use
words
of
approval
and
agreement
were
still
to
be
heard
but
the
serious
faces
of
the
peasants
grew
still
more
serious
and
the
eyes
that
had
been
fixed
on
the
gentleman
dropped
as
if
they
were
unwilling
to
put
him
to
shame
by
letting
him
see
that
every
one
had
understood
his
trick
and
that
no
one
would
be
deceived
by
him
nekhludoff
spoke
clearly
and
the
peasants
were
intelligent
but
they
did
not
and
could
not
understand
him
for
the
same
reason
that
the
foreman
had
so
long
been
unable
to
understand
him
they
were
fully
convinced
that
it
is
natural
for
every
man
to
consider
his
own
interest
the
experience
of
many
generations
had
proved
to
them
that
the
landlords
always
considered
their
own
interest
to
the
detriment
of
the
peasants
therefore
if
a
landlord
called
them
to
a
meeting
and
made
them
some
kind
of
a
new
offer
it
could
evidently
only
be
in
order
to
swindle
them
more
cunningly
than
before
well
then
what
are
you
willing
to
rent
the
land
at
asked
nekhludoff
how
can
we
fix
a
price
we
cannot
do
it
the
land
is
yours
and
the
power
is
in
your
hands
answered
some
voices
from
among
the
crowd
oh
not
at
all
you
will
yourselves
have
the
use
of
the
money
for
communal
purposes
we
cannot
do
it
the
commune
is
one
thing
and
this
is
another
dont
you
understand
said
the
foreman
with
a
smile
he
had
followed
nekhludoff
to
the
meeting
the
prince
is
letting
the
land
to
you
for
money
and
is
giving
you
the
money
back
to
form
a
capital
for
the
commune
we
understand
very
well
said
a
cross
toothless
old
man
without
raising
his
eyes
something
like
a
bank
we
should
have
to
pay
at
a
fixed
time
we
do
not
wish
it
it
is
hard
enough
as
it
is
and
that
would
ruin
us
completely
thats
no
go
we
prefer
to
go
on
the
old
way
began
several
dissatisfied
and
even
rude
voices
the
refusals
grew
very
vehement
when
nekhludoff
mentioned
that
he
would
draw
up
an
agreement
which
would
have
to
be
signed
by
him
and
by
them
why
sign
we
shall
go
on
working
as
we
have
done
hitherto
what
is
all
this
for
we
are
ignorant
men
we
cant
agree
because
this
sort
of
thing
is
not
what
we
have
been
used
to
as
it
was
so
let
it
continue
to
be
only
the
seeds
we
should
like
to
withdraw
this
meant
that
under
the
present
arrangement
the
seeds
had
to
be
provided
by
the
peasants
and
they
wanted
the
landlord
to
provide
them
then
am
i
to
understand
that
you
refuse
to
accept
the
land
nekhludoff
asked
addressing
a
middleaged
barefooted
peasant
with
a
tattered
coat
and
a
bright
look
on
his
face
who
was
holding
his
worn
cap
with
his
left
hand
in
a
peculiarly
straight
position
in
the
same
way
soldiers
hold
theirs
when
commanded
to
take
them
off
just
so
said
this
peasant
who
had
evidently
not
yet
rid
himself
of
the
military
hypnotism
he
had
been
subjected
to
while
serving
his
time
it
means
that
you
have
sufficient
land
said
nekhludoff
no
sir
we
have
not
said
the
exsoldier
with
an
artificially
pleased
look
carefully
holding
his
tattered
cap
in
front
of
him
as
if
offering
it
to
any
one
who
liked
to
make
use
of
it
well
anyhow
youd
better
think
over
what
i
have
said
nekhludoff
spoke
with
surprise
and
again
repeated
his
offer
we
have
no
need
to
think
about
it
as
we
have
said
so
it
will
be
angrily
muttered
the
morose
toothless
old
man
i
shall
remain
here
another
day
and
if
you
change
your
minds
send
to
let
me
know
the
peasants
gave
no
answer
so
nekhludoff
did
not
succeed
in
arriving
at
any
result
from
this
interview
if
i
might
make
a
remark
prince
said
the
foreman
when
they
got
home
you
will
never
come
to
any
agreement
with
them
they
are
so
obstinate
at
a
meeting
these
people
just
stick
in
one
place
and
there
is
no
moving
them
it
is
because
they
are
frightened
of
everything
why
these
very
peasantssay
that
whitehaired
one
or
the
dark
one
who
were
refusing
are
intelligent
peasants
when
one
of
them
comes
to
the
office
and
one
makes
him
sit
down
to
cup
of
tea
its
like
in
the
palace
of
wisdomhe
is
quite
diplomatist
said
the
foreman
smiling
he
will
consider
everything
rightly
at
a
meeting
its
a
different
manhe
keeps
repeating
one
and
the
same



well
could
not
some
of
the
more
intelligent
men
be
asked
to
come
here
said
nekhludoff
i
would
carefully
explain
it
to
them
that
can
be
done
said
the
smiling
foreman
well
then
would
you
mind
calling
them
here
tomorrow
oh
certainly
i
will
said
the
foreman
and
smiled
still
more
joyfully
i
shall
call
them
tomorrow
just
hear
him
hes
not
artful
not
he
said
a
blackhaired
peasant
with
an
unkempt
beard
as
he
sat
jolting
from
side
to
side
on
a
wellfed
mare
addressing
an
old
man
in
a
torn
coat
who
rode
by
his
side
the
two
men
were
driving
a
herd
of
the
peasants

to
graze
in

have
a
little
sense
he
added
and
began
shouting
at
a
colt
that
had
strayed
he
stopped
his
horse
and
looked
round
but
the
colt
had
not
remained
behind
it
had
gone
into
the
meadow
by
the
roadside

that
son
of
a
turk
hes
taken
to
getting
into

said
the
dark
peasant
with
the
unkempt
beard
hearing
the
cracking
of
the
sorrel
stalks
that
the
neighing
colt
was
galloping
over
as
he
came
running
back
from
the
scented
meadow
do
you
hear

says
the
unkempt

continued
giving
his
opinion

landlords
speech
sign
indeed
and
let
him
swallow
you
up
thats
certain
answered
the
old
man
and
then
they
were
silent
and
the
tramping
of
the
horses
feet
along
the
highroad
was
the
only
sound
to
be
heard

gods
peace
in
the
heart
when
nekhludoff
returned
he
found
that
the
office
had
been
arranged
as
a
bedroom
for
him
a
high
bedstead
with
a
feather
bed
and
two
large
pillows
had
been
placed
in
the
room
the
bed
was
covered
with
a
dark
red
doublebedded
silk
quilt
which
was
elaborately
and
finely
quilted
and
very
stiff
it
evidently
belonged
to
the
trousseau
of
the
foremans
wife
the
foreman
offered
nekhludoff
the
remains
of
the
dinner
which
the
latter
refused
and
excusing
himself
for
the
poorness
of
the
fare
and
the
accommodation
he
left
nekhludoff
alone
the
peasants
refusal
did
not
at
all
bother
nekhludoff
on
the
contrary
though
at
kousminski
his
offer
had
been
accepted
and
he
had
even
been
thanked
for
it
and
here
he
was
met
with
suspicion
and
even
enmity
he
felt
contented
and
joyful
it
was
close
and
dirty
in
the
office
nekhludoff
went
out
into
the
yard
and
was
going
into
the
garden
but
he
remembered
that
night
the
window
of
the
maidservants
room
the
side
porch
and
he
felt
uncomfortable
and
did
not
like
to
pass
the
spot
desecrated
by
guilty
memories
he
sat
down
on
the
doorstep
and
breathing
in
the
warm
air
balmy
with
the
strong
scent
of
fresh
birch
leaves
he
sat
for
a
long
time
looking
into
the
dark
garden
and
listening
to
the
mill
the
nightingales
and
some
other
bird
that
whistled
monotonously
in
the
bush
close
by
the
light
disappeared
from
the
foremans
window
in
the
cast
behind
the
barn
appeared
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
and
sheet
lightning
began
to
light
up
the
dilapidated
house
and
the
blooming
overgrown
garden
more
and
more
frequently
it
began
to
thunder
in
the
distance
and
a
black
cloud
spread
over
onethird
of
the
sky
the
nightingales
and
the
other
birds
were
silent
above
the
murmur
of
the
water
from
the
mill
came
the
cackling
of
geese
and
then
in
the
village
and
in
the
foremans
yard
the
first
cocks
began
to
crow
earlier
than
usual
as
they
do
on
warm
thundery
nights
there
is
a
saying
that
if
the
cocks
crow
early
the
night
will
be
a
merry
one
for
nekhludoff
the
night
was
more
than
merry
it
was
a
happy
joyful
night
imagination
renewed
the
impressions
of
that
happy
summer
which
he
had
spent
here
as
an
innocent
lad
and
he
felt
himself
as
he
had
been
not
only
at
that
but
at
all
the
best
moments
of
his
life
he
not
only
remembered
but
felt
as
he
had
felt
when
at
the
age
of
14
he
prayed
that
god
would
show
him
the
truth
or
when
as
a
child
he
had
wept
on
his
mothers
lap
when
parting
from
her
and
promising
to
be
always
good
and
never
give
her
pain
he
felt
as
he
did
when
he
and
nikolenka
irtenieff
resolved
always
to
support
each
other
in
living
a
good
life
and
to
try
to
make
everybody
happy
he
remembered
how
he
had
been
tempted
in
kousminski
so
that
he
had
begun
to
regret
the
house
and
the
forest
and
the
farm
and
the
land
and
he
asked
himself
if
he
regretted
them
now
and
it
even
seemed
strange
to
think
that
he
could
regret
them
he
remembered
all
he
had
seen
today
the
woman
with
the
children
and
without
her
husband
who
was
in
prison
for
having
cut
down
trees
in
his
nekhludoffs
forest
and
the
terrible
matrona
who
considered
or
at
least
talked
as
if
she
considered
that
women
of
her
position
must
give
themselves
to
the
gentlefolk
he
remembered
her
relation
to
the
babies
the
way
in
which
they
were
taken
to
the
foundlings
hospital
and
the
unfortunate
smiling
wizened
baby
with
the
patchwork
cap
dying
of
starvation
and
then
he
suddenly
remembered
the
prison
the
shaved
heads
the
cells
the
disgusting
smells
the
chains
and
by
the
side
of
it
all
the
madly
lavish
city
lift
of
the
rich
himself
included
the
bright
moon
now
almost
full
rose
above
the
barn
dark
shadows
fell
across
the
yard
and
the
iron
roof
of
the
ruined
house
shone
bright
as
if
unwilling
to
waste
this
light
the
nightingales
again
began
their
trills
nekhludoff
called
to
mind
how
he
had
begun
to
consider
his
life
in
the
garden
of
kousminski
when
deciding
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
remembered
how
confused
he
had
become
how
he
could
not
arrive
at
any
decision
how
many
difficulties
each
question
had
presented
he
asked
himself
these
questions
now
and
was
surprised
how
simple
it
all
was
it
was
simple
because
he
was
not
thinking
now
of
what
would
be
the
results
for
himself
but
only
thought
of
what
he
had
to
do
and
strange
to
say
what
he
had
to
do
for
himself
he
could
not
decide
but
what
he
had
to
do
for
others
he
knew
without
any
doubt
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
must
not
leave
katusha
but
go
on
helping
her
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
must
study
investigate
clear
up
understand
all
this
business
concerning
judgment
and
punishment
which
he
felt
he
saw
differently
to
other
people
what
would
result
from
it
all
he
did
not
know
but
he
knew
for
certain
that
he
must
do
it
and
this
firm
assurance
gave
him
joy
the
black
cloud
had
spread
all
over
the
sky
the
lightning
flashed
vividly
across
the
yard
and
the
old
house
with
its
tumbledown
porches
the
thunder
growled
overhead
all
the
birds
were
silent
but
the
leaves
rustled
and
the
wind
reached
the
step
where
nekhludoff
stood
and
played
with
his
hair
one
drop
came
down
then
another
then
they
came
drumming
on
the
dock
leaves
and
on
the
iron
of
the
roof
and
all
the
air
was
filled
by
a
bright
flash
and
before
nekhludoff
could
count
three
a
fearful
crash
sounded
over
head
and
spread
pealing
all
over
the
sky
nekhludoff
went
in
yes
yes
he
thought
the
work
that
our
life
accomplishes
the
whole
of
this
work
the
meaning
of
it
is
not
nor
can
be
intelligible
to
me
what
were
my
aunts
for
why
did
nikolenka
irtenieff
die
why
am
i
living
what
was
katusha
for
and
my
madness
why
that
war
why
my
subsequent
lawless
life
to
understand
it
to
understand
the
whole
of
the
masters
will
is
not
in
my
power
but
to
do
his
will
that
is
written
down
in
my
conscience
is
in
my
power
that
i
know
for
certain
and
when
i
am
fulfilling
it
i
have
sureness
and
peace
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
and
rushed
from
the
roof
into
a
tub
beneath
the
lightning
lit
up
the
house
and
yard
less
frequently
nekhludoff
went
into
his
room
undressed
and
lay
down
not
without
fear
of
the
bugs
whose
presence
the
dirty
torn
wallpapers
made
him
suspect
yes
to
feel
ones
self
not
the
master
but
a
servant
he
thought
and
rejoiced
at
the
thought
his
fears
were
not
vain
hardly
had
he
put
out
his
candle
when
the
vermin
attacked
and
stung
him
to
give
up
the
land
and
go
to
siberia
fleas
bugs
dirt
ah
well
if
it
must
be
borne
i
shall
bear
it
but
in
spite
of
the
best
of
intentions
he
could
not
bear
it
and
sat
down
by
the
open
window
and
gazed
with
admiration
at
the
retreating
clouds
and
the
reappearing
moon
chapter
ix
the
land
settlement
it
was
morning
before
nekhludoff
could
fall
asleep
and
therefore
he
woke
up
late
at
noon
seven
men
chosen
from
among
the
peasants
at
the
foremans
invitation
came
into
the
orchard
where
the
foreman
had
arranged
a
table
and
benches
by
digging
posts
into
the
ground
and
fixing
boards
on
the
top
under
the
apple
trees
it
took
some
time
before
the
peasants
could
be
persuaded
to
put
on
their
caps
and
to
sit
down
on
the
benches
especially
firm
was
the
exsoldier
who
today
had
bark
shoes
on
he
stood
erect
holding
his
cap
as
they
do
at
funerals
according
to
military
regulation
when
one
of
them
a
respectablelooking
broadshouldered
old
man
with
a
curly
grizzly
beard
like
that
of
michael
angelos
moses
and
grey
hair
that
curled
round
the
brown
bald
forehead
put
on
his
big
cap
and
wrapping
his
coat
round
him
got
in
behind
the
table
and
sat
down
the
rest
followed
his
example
when
all
had
taken
their
places
nekhludoff
sat
down
opposite
them
and
leaning
on
the
table
over
the
paper
on
which
he
had
drawn
up
his
project
he
began
explaining
it
whether
it
was
that
there
were
fewer
present
or
that
he
was
occupied
with
the
business
in
hand
and
not
with
himself
anyhow
this
time
nekhludoff
felt
no
confusion
he
involuntarily
addressed
the
broadshouldered
old
man
with
white
ringlets
in
his
grizzly
beard
expecting
approbation
or
objections
from
him
but
nekhludoffs
conjecture
was
wrong
the
respectablelooking
old
patriarch
though
he
nodded
his
handsome
head
approvingly
or
shook
it
and
frowned
when
the
others
raised
an
objection
evidently
understood
with
great
difficulty
and
only
when
the
others
repeated
what
nekhludoff
had
said
in
their
own
words
a
little
almost
beardless
old
fellow
blind
in
one
eye
who
sat
by
the
side
of
the
patriarch
and
had
a
patched
nankeen
coat
and
old
boots
on
and
as
nekhludoff
found
out
later
was
an
ovenbuilder
understood
much
better
this
man
moved
his
brows
quickly
attending
to
nekhludoffs
words
with
an
effort
and
at
once
repeated
them
in
his
own
way
an
old
thickset
man
with
a
white
beard
and
intelligent
eyes
understood
as
quickly
and
took
every
opportunity
to
put
in
an
ironical
joke
clearly
wishing
to
show
off
the
exsoldier
seemed
also
to
understand
matters
but
got
mixed
being
used
to
senseless
soldiers
talk
a
tall
man
with
a
small
beard
a
long
nose
and
a
bass
voice
who
wore
clean
homemade
clothes
and
new
barkplaited
shoes
seemed
to
be
the
one
most
seriously
interested
this
man
spoke
only
when
there
was
need
of
it
the
two
other
old
men
the
same
toothless
one
who
had
shouted
a
distinct
refusal
at
the
meeting
the
day
before
to
every
proposal
of
nekhludoffs
and
a
tall
white
lame
old
man
with
a
kind
face
his
thin
legs
tightly
wrapped
round
with
strips
of
linen
said
little
though
they
listened
attentively
first
of
all
nekhludoff
explained
his
views
in
regard
to
personal
property
in
land
the
land
according
to
my
idea
can
neither
be
bought
nor
sold
because
if
it
could
be
he
who
has
got
the
money
could
buy
it
all
and
exact
anything
he
liked
for
the
use
of
the
land
from
those
who
have
none
thats
true
said
the
longnosed
man
in
a
deep
bass
just
so
said
the
exsoldier
a
woman
gathers
a
little
grass
for
her
cow
shes
caught
and
imprisoned
said
the
whitebearded
old
man
our
own
land
is
five
versts
away
and
as
to
renting
any
its
impossible
the
price
is
raised
so
high
that
it
wont
pay
added
the
cross
toothless
old
man
they
twist
us
into
ropes
worse
than
during
serfdom
i
think
as
you
do
and
i
count
it
a
sin
to
possess
land
so
i
wish
to
give
it
away
said
nekhludoff
well
thats
a
good
thing
said
the
old
man
with
curls
like
angelos
moses
evidently
thinking
that
nekhludoff
meant
to
let
the
land
i
have
come
here
because
i
no
longer
wish
to
possess
any
land
and
now
we
must
consider
the
best
way
of
dividing
it
just
give
it
to
the
peasants
thats
all
said
the
cross
toothless
old
man
nekhludoff
was
abashed
for
a
moment
feeling
a
suspicion
of
his
not
being
honest
in
these
words
but
he
instantly
recovered
and
made
use
of
the
remark
in
order
to
express
what
was
in
his
mind
in
reply
i
should
be
glad
to
give
it
them
he
said
but
to
whom
and
how
to
which
of
the
peasants
why
to
your
commune
and
not
to
that
of
deminsk
that
was
the
name
of
a
neighbouring
village
with
very
little
land
all
were
silent
then
the
exsoldier
said
just
so
now
then
tell
me
how
would
you
divide
the
land
among
the
peasants
if
you
had
to
do
it
said
nekhludoff
we
should
divide
it
up
equally
so
much
for
every
man
said
the
ovenbuilder
quickly
raising
and
lowering
his
brows
how
else
of
course
so
much
per
man
said
the
good
natured
lame
man
with
the
white
strips
of
linen
round
his
legs
every
one
confirmed
this
statement
considering
it
satisfactory
so
much
per
man
then
are
the
servants
attached
to
the
house
also
to
have
a
share
nekhludoff
asked
oh
no
said
the
exsoldier
trying
to
appear
bold
and
merry
but
the
tall
reasonable
man
would
not
agree
with
him
if
one
is
to
divide
all
must
share
alike
he
said
in
his
deep
bass
after
a
little
consideration
it
cant
be
done
said
nekhludoff
who
had
already
prepared
his
reply
if
all
are
to
share
alike
then
those
who
do
not
work
themselvesdo
not
ploughwill
sell
their
shares
to
the
rich
the
rich
will
again
get
at
the
land
those
who
live
by
working
the
land
will
multiply
and
land
will
again
be
scarce
then
the
rich
will
again
get
those
who
need
land
into
their
power
just
so
quickly
said
the
exsoldier
forbid
to
sell
the
land
let
only
him
who
ploughs
it
have
it
angrily
interrupted
the
ovenbuilder
to
this
nekhludoff
replied
that
it
was
impossible
to
know
who
was
ploughing
for
himself
and
who
for
another
the
tall
reasonable
man
proposed
that
an
arrangement
be
made
so
that
they
should
all
plough
communally
and
those
who
ploughed
should
get
the
produce
and
those
who
did
not
should
get
nothing
to
this
communistic
project
nekhludoff
had
also
an
answer
ready
he
said
that
for
such
an
arrangement
it
would
be
necessary
that
all
should
have
ploughs
and
that
all
the
horses
should
be
alike
so
that
none
should
be
left
behind
and
that
ploughs
and
horses
and
all
the
implements
would
have
to
be
communal
property
and
that
in
order
to
get
that
all
the
people
would
have
to
agree
our
people
could
not
be
made
to
agree
in
a
lifetime
said
the
cross
old
man
we
should
have
regular
fights
said
the
whitebearded
old
man
with
the
laughing
eyes
so
that
the
thing
is
not
as
simple
as
it
looks
said
nekhludoff
and
this
is
a
thing
not
only
we
but
many
have
been
considering
there
is
an
american
henry
george
this
is
what
he
has
thought
out
and
i
agree
with
him
why
you
are
the
master
and
you
give
it
as
you
like
whats
it
to
you
the
power
is
yours
said
the
cross
old
man
this
confused
nekhludoff
but
he
was
pleased
to
see
that
not
he
alone
was
dissatisfied
with
this
interruption
you
wait
a
bit
uncle
simon
let
him
tell
us
about
it
said
the
reasonable
man
in
his
imposing
bass
this
emboldened
nekhludoff
and
he
began
to
explain
henry
georges
singletax
system
the
earth
is
no
mans
it
is
gods
he
began
just
so
that
it
is
several
voices
replied
the
land
is
common
to
all
all
have
the
same
right
to
it
but
there
is
good
land
and
bad
land
and
every
one
would
like
to
take
the
good
land
how
is
one
to
do
in
order
to
get
it
justly
divided
in
this
way
he
that
will
use
the
good
land
must
pay
those
who
have
got
no
land
the
value
of
the
land
he
uses
nekhludoff
went
on
answering
his
own
question
as
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
who
should
pay
whom
and
money
is
needed
for
communal
use
it
should
be
arranged
that
he
who
uses
the
good
land
should
pay
the
amount
of
the
value
of
his
land
to
the
commune
for
its
needs
then
every
one
would
share
equally
if
you
want
to
use
land
pay
for
itmore
for
the
good
less
for
the
bad
land
if
you
do
not
wish
to
use
land
dont
pay
anything
and
those
who
use
the
land
will
pay
the
taxes
and
the
communal
expenses
for
you
well
he
had
a
head
this
george
said
the
ovenbuilder
moving
his
brows
he
who
has
good
land
must
pay
more
if
only
the
payment
is
according
to
our
strength
said
the
tall
man
with
the
bass
voice
evidently
foreseeing
how
the
matter
would
end
the
payment
should
be
not
too
high
and
not
too
low
if
it
is
too
high
it
will
not
get
paid
and
there
will
be
a
loss
and
if
it
is
too
low
it
will
be
bought
and
sold
there
would
be
a
trading
in
land
this
is
what
i
wished
to
arrange
among
you
here
that
is
just
that
is
right
yes
that
would
do
said
the
peasants
he
has
a
head
this
george
said
the
broadshouldered
old
man
with
the
curls
see
what
he
has
invented
well
then
how
would
it
be
if
i
wished
to
take
some
land
asked
the
smiling
foreman
if
there
is
an
allotment
to
spare
take
it
and
work
it
said
nekhludoff
what
do
you
want
it
for
you
have
sufficient
as
it
is
said
the
old
man
with
the
laughing
eyes
with
this
the
conference
ended
nekhludoff
repeated
his
offer
and
advised
the
men
to
talk
it
over
with
the
rest
of
the
commune
and
to
return
with
the
answer
the
peasants
said
they
would
talk
it
over
and
bring
an
answer
and
left
in
a
state
of
excitement
their
loud
talk
was
audible
as
they
went
along
the
road
and
up
to
late
in
the
night
the
sound
of
voices
came
along
the
river
from
the
village
the
next
day
the
peasants
did
not
go
to
work
but
spent
it
in
considering
the
landlords
offer
the
commune
was
divided
into
two
partiesone
which
regarded
the
offer
as
a
profitable
one
to
themselves
and
saw
no
danger
in
agreeing
with
it
and
another
which
suspected
and
feared
the
offer
it
did
not
understand
on
the
third
day
however
all
agreed
and
some
were
sent
to
nekhludoff
to
accept
his
offer
they
were
influenced
in
their
decision
by
the
explanation
some
of
the
old
men
gave
of
the
landlords
conduct
which
did
away
with
all
fear
of
deceit
they
thought
the
gentleman
had
begun
to
consider
his
soul
and
was
acting
as
he
did
for
its
salvation
the
alms
which
nekhludoff
had
given
away
while
in
panovo
made
his
explanation
seem
likely
the
fact
that
nekhludoff
had
never
before
been
face
to
face
with
such
great
poverty
and
so
bare
a
life
as
the
peasants
had
come
to
in
this
place
and
was
so
appalled
by
it
made
him
give
away
money
in
charity
though
he
knew
that
this
was
not
reasonable
he
could
not
help
giving
the
money
of
which
he
now
had
a
great
deal
having
received
a
large
sum
for
the
forest
he
had
sold
the
year
before
and
also
the
hand
money
for
the
implements
and
stock
in
kousminski
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
the
master
was
giving
money
in
charity
crowds
of
people
chiefly
women
began
to
come
to
ask
him
for
help
he
did
not
in
the
least
know
how
to
deal
with
them
how
to
decide
how
much
and
whom
to
give
to
he
felt
that
to
refuse
to
give
money
of
which
he
had
a
great
deal
to
poor
people
was
impossible
yet
to
give
casually
to
those
who
asked
was
not
wise
the
last
day
he
spent
in
panovo
nekhludoff
looked
over
the
things
left
in
his
aunts
house
and
in
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
mahogany
wardrobe
with
the
brass
lions
heads
with
rings
through
them
he
found
many
letters
and
amongst
them
a
photograph
of
a
group
consisting
of
his
aunts
sophia
ivanovna
and
mary
ivanovna
a
student
and
katusha
of
all
the
things
in
the
house
he
took
only
the
letters
and
the
photograph
the
rest
he
left
to
the
miller
who
at
the
smiling
foremans
recommendation
had
bought
the
house
and
all
it
contained
to
be
taken
down
and
carried
away
at
onetenth
of
the
real
value
recalling
the
feeling
of
regret
at
the
loss
of
his
property
which
he
had
felt
in
kousminski
nekhludoff
was
surprised
how
he
could
have
felt
this
regret
now
he
felt
nothing
but
unceasing
joy
at
the
deliverance
and
a
sensation
of
newness
something
like
that
which
a
traveller
must
experience
when
discovering
new
countries
chapter
x
nekhludoff
returns
to
town
the
town
struck
nekhludoff
in
a
new
and
peculiar
light
on
his
return
he
came
back
in
the
evening
when
the
gas
was
lit
and
drove
from
the
railway
station
to
his
house
where
the
rooms
still
smelt
of
naphthaline
agraphena
petrovna
and
corney
were
both
feeling
tired
and
dissatisfied
and
had
even
had
a
quarrel
over
those
things
that
seemed
made
only
to
be
aired
and
packed
away
nekhludoffs
room
was
empty
but
not
in
order
and
the
way
to
it
was
blocked
up
with
boxes
so
that
his
arrival
evidently
hindered
the
business
which
owing
to
a
curious
kind
of
inertia
was
going
on
in
this
house
the
evident
folly
of
these
proceedings
in
which
he
had
once
taken
part
was
so
distasteful
to
nekhludoff
after
the
impressions
the
misery
of
the
life
of
the
peasants
had
made
on
him
that
he
decided
to
go
to
a
hotel
the
next
day
leaving
agraphena
petrovna
to
put
away
the
things
as
she
thought
fit
until
his
sister
should
come
and
finally
dispose
of
everything
in
the
house
nekhludoff
left
home
early
and
chose
a
couple
of
rooms
in
a
very
modest
and
not
particularly
clean
lodginghouse
within
easy
reach
of
the
prison
and
having
given
orders
that
some
of
his
things
should
be
sent
there
he
went
to
see
the
advocate
it
was
cold
out
of
doors
after
some
rainy
and
stormy
weather
it
had
turned
out
cold
as
it
often
does
in
spring
it
was
so
cold
that
nekhludoff
felt
quite
chilly
in
his
light
overcoat
and
walked
fast
hoping
to
get
warmer
his
mind
was
filled
with
thoughts
of
the
peasants
the
women
children
old
men
and
all
the
poverty
and
weariness
which
he
seemed
to
have
seen
for
the
first
time
especially
the
smiling
oldfaced
infant
writhing
with
his
calfless
little
legs
and
he
could
not
help
contrasting
what
was
going
on
in
the
town
passing
by
the
butchers
fishmongers
and
clothiers
shops
he
was
struck
as
if
he
saw
them
for
the
first
time
by
the
appearance
of
the
clean
wellfed
shopkeepers
like
whom
you
could
not
find
one
peasant
in
the
country
these
men
were
apparently
convinced
that
the
pains
they
took
to
deceive
the
people
who
did
not
know
much
about
their
goods
was
not
a
useless
but
rather
an
important
business
the
coachmen
with
their
broad
hips
and
rows
of
buttons
down
their
sides
and
the
doorkeepers
with
gold
cords
on
their
caps
the
servantgirls
with
their
aprons
and
curly
fringes
and
especially
the
smart
isvostchiks
with
the
nape
of
their
necks
clean
shaved
as
they
sat
lolling
back
in
their
traps
and
examined
the
passersby
with
dissolute
and
contemptuous
air
looked
well
fed
in
all
these
people
nekhludoff
could
not
now
help
seeing
some
of
these
very
peasants
who
had
been
driven
into
the
town
by
lack
of
land
some
of
the
peasants
driven
to
the
town
had
found
means
of
profiting
by
the
conditions
of
town
life
and
had
become
like
the
gentlefolk
and
were
pleased
with
their
position
others
were
in
a
worse
position
than
they
had
been
in
the
country
and
were
more
to
be
pitied
than
the
country
people
such
seemed
the
bootmakers
nekhludoff
saw
in
the
cellar
the
pale
dishevelled
washerwomen
with
their
thin
bare
arms
ironing
at
an
open
window
out
of
which
streamed
soapy
steam
such
the
two
housepainters
with
their
aprons
stockingless
feet
all
bespattered
and
smeared
with
paint
whom
nekhludoff
mettheir
weak
brown
arms
bared
to
above
the
elbowscarrying
a
pailful
of
paint
and
quarrelling
with
each
other
their
faces
looked
haggard
and
cross
the
dark
faces
of
the
carters
jolting
along
in
their
carts
bore
the
same
expression
and
so
did
the
faces
of
the
tattered
men
and
women
who
stood
begging
at
the
street
corners
the
same
kind
of
faces
were
to
be
seen
at
the
open
windows
of
the
eatinghouses
which
nekhludoff
passed
by
the
dirty
tables
on
which
stood
tea
things
and
bottles
and
between
which
waiters
dressed
in
white
shirts
were
rushing
hither
and
thither
sat
shouting
and
singing
red
perspiring
men
with
stupefied
faces
one
sat
by
the
window
with
lifted
brows
and
pouting
lips
and
fixed
eyes
as
if
trying
to
remember
something
and
why
are
they
all
gathered
here
nekhludoff
thought
breathing
in
together
with
the
dust
which
the
cold
wind
blew
towards
him
the
air
filled
with
the
smell
of
rank
oil
and
fresh
paint
in
one
street
he
met
a
row
of
carts
loaded
with
something
made
of
iron
that
rattled
so
on
the
uneven
pavement
that
it
made
his
ears
and
head
ache
he
started
walking
still
faster
in
order
to
pass
the
row
of
carts
when
he
heard
himself
called
by
name
he
stopped
and
saw
an
officer
with
sharp
pointed
moustaches
and
shining
face
who
sat
in
the
trap
of
a
swell
isvostchik
and
waved
his
hand
in
a
friendly
manner
his
smile
disclosing
unusually
long
white
teeth
nekhludoff
can
it
be
you
nekhludoffs
first
feeling
was
one
of
pleasure
ah
schonbock
he
exclaimed
joyfully
but
he
knew
the
next
moment
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
joyful
about
this
was
that
schonbock
who
had
been
in
the
house
of
nekhludoffs
aunts
that
day
and
whom
nekhludoff
had
quite
lost
out
of
sight
but
about
whom
he
had
heard
that
in
spite
of
his
debts
he
had
somehow
managed
to
remain
in
the
cavalry
and
by
some
means
or
other
still
kept
his
place
among
the
rich
his
gay
contented
appearance
corroborated
this
report
what
a
good
thing
that
i
have
caught
you
there
is
no
one
in
town
ah
old
fellow
you
have
grown
old
he
said
getting
out
of
the
trap
and
moving
his
shoulders
about
i
only
knew
you
by
your
walk
look
here

must
dine
together

any
place
where
they
feed
one
decently
i
dont
think
i
can
spare
the
time
nekhludoff
answered
thinking
only
of
how
he
could
best
get
rid
of
his
companion
without
hurting
him
and
what
has
brought
you
here
he
asked
business
old
fellow
guardianship
business
i
am
a
guardian
now
i
am
managing
samanoffs
affairsthe
millionaire
you
know
he
has
softening
of
the
brain
and
hes
got
fiftyfour
thousand
desiatins
of
land
he
said
with
peculiar
pride
as
if
he
had
himself
made
all
these
desiatins
the
affairs
were
terribly
neglected
all
the
land
was
let
to
the
peasants
they
did
not
pay
anything
there
were
more
than
eighty
thousand
roubles
debts
i
changed
it
all
in
one
year
and
have
got
70
per
cent
more
out
of
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
asked
proudly
nekhludoff
remembered
having
heard
that
this
schonbock
just
because
he
had
spent
all
he
had
had
attained
by
some
special
influence
the
post
of
guardian
to
a
rich
old
man
who
was
squandering
his
propertyand
was
now
evidently
living
by
this
guardianship
how
am
i
to
get
rid
of
him
without
offending
him
thought
nekhludoff
looking
at
this
full
shiny
face
with
the
stiffened
moustache
and
listening
to
his
friendly
goodhumoured
chatter
about
where
one
gets
fed
best
and
his
bragging
about
his
doings
as
a
guardian
well
then
where
do
we
dine
really
i
have
no
time
to
spare
said
nekhludoff
glancing
at
his
watch
then
look
here
tonight
at
the
raceswill
you
be
there

i

i
cannot

said
nekhludoff
with
a
smile
well
thats
too
bad
and
where
are
you
off
to
now
shall
i
give
you
a
lift
i
am
going
to
see
an
advocate
close
to
here
round
the
corner
oh
yes
of
course
you
have
got
something
to
do
with
the
prisonshave
turned
into
a
prisoners
mediator
i
hear
said
schonbock
laughing
the
korchagins
told
me
they
have
left
town
already
what
does
it
all
mean
tell
me
yes
yes
it
is
quite
true
nekhludoff
answered
but
i
cannot
tell
you
about
it
in
the
street
of
course
you
always
were
a
crank
but
you
will
come
to
the
races
no
i
neither
can
nor
wish
to
come
please
do
not
be
angry
with
me
angry
dear
me
no
where
do
you
live
and
suddenly
his
face
became
serious
his
eyes
fixed
and
he
drew
up
his
brows
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
remember
something
and
nekhludoff
noticed
the
same
dull
expression
as
that
of
the
man
with
the
raised
brows
and
pouting
lips
whom
he
had
seen
at
the
window
of
the
eatinghouse
how
cold
it
is
is
it
not
have
you
got
the
parcels
said
schonbock
turning
to
the
isvostchik
all
right
goodbye
i
am
very
glad
indeed
to
have
met
you
and
warmly
pressing
nekhludoffs
hand
he
jumped
into
the
trap
and
waved
his
whitegloved
hand
in
front
of
his
shiny
face
with
his
usual
smile
showing
his
exceptionally
white
teeth
can
i
have
also
been
like
that
nekhludoff
thought
as
he
continued
his
way
to
the
advocates
yes
i
wished
to
be
like
that
though
i
was
not
quite
like
it
and
i
thought
of
living
my
life
in
that
way
chapter
xi
an
advocates
views
on
judges
and
prosecutors
nekhludoff
was
admitted
by
the
advocate
before
his
turn
the
advocate
at
once
commenced
to
talk
about
the
menshoffs
case
which
he
had
read
with
indignation
at
the
inconsistency
of
the
accusation
this
case
is
perfectly
revolting
he
said
it
is
very
likely
that
the
owner
himself
set
fire
to
the
building
in
order
to
get
the
insurance
money
and
the
chief
thing
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
prove
the
menshoffs
guilt
there
are
no
proofs
whatever
it
is
all
owing
to
the
special
zeal
of
the
examining
magistrate
and
the
carelessness
of
the
prosecutor
if
they
are
tried
here
and
not
in
a
provincial
court
i
guarantee
that
they
will
be
acquitted
and
i
shall
charge
nothing
now
then
the
next
case
that
of
theodosia
birukoff
the
appeal
to
the
emperor
is
written
if
you
go
to
petersburg
youd
better
take
it
with
you
and
hand
it
in
yourself
with
a
request
of
your
own
or
else
they
will
only
make
a
few
inquiries
and
nothing
will
come
of
it
you
must
try
and
get
at
some
of
the
influential
members
of
the
appeal
committee
well
is
this
all
no
here
i
have
a
letter



i
see
you
have
turned
into
a
pipea
spout
through
which
all
the
complaints
of
the
prison
are
poured
said
the
advocate
with
a
smile
it
is
too
much
youll
not
be
able
to
manage
it
no
but
this
is
a
striking
case
said
nekhludoff
and
gave
a
brief
outline
of
the
case
of
a
peasant
who
began
to
read
the
gospels
to
the
peasants
in
the
village
and
to
discuss
them
with
his
friends
the
priests
regarded
this
as
a
crime
and
informed
the
authorities
the
magistrate
examined
him
and
the
public
prosecutor
drew
up
an
act
of
indictment
and
the
law
courts
committed
him
for
trial
this
is
really
too
terrible
nekhludoff
said
can
it
be
true
what
are
you
surprised
at
why
everything
i
can
understand
the
policeofficer
who
simply
obeys
orders
but
the
prosecutor
drawing
up
an
act
of
that
kind
an
educated
man



that
is
where
the
mistake
lies
that
we
are
in
the
habit
of
considering
that
the
prosecutors
and
the
judges
in
general
are
some
kind
of
liberal
persons
there
was
a
time
when
they
were
such
but
now
it
is
quite
different
they
are
just
officials
only
troubled
about
payday
they
receive
their
salaries
and
want
them
increased
and
there
their
principles
end
they
will
accuse
judge
and
sentence
any
one
you
like
yes
but
do
laws
really
exist
that
can
condemn
a
man
to
siberia
for
reading
the
bible
with
his
friends
not
only
to
be
exiled
to
the
less
remote
parts
of
siberia
but
even
to
the
mines
if
you
can
only
prove
that
reading
the
bible
they
took
the
liberty
of
explaining
it
to
others
not
according
to
orders
and
in
this
way
condemned
the
explanations
given
by
the
church
blaming
the
greek
orthodox
religion
in
the
presence
of
the
common
people
means
according
to
statute



the
mines
impossible
i
assure
you
it
is
so
i
always
tell
these
gentlemen
the
judges
the
advocate
continued
that
i
cannot
look
at
them
without
gratitude
because
if
i
am
not
in
prison
and
you
and
all
of
us
it
is
only
owing
to
their
kindness
to
deprive
us
of
our
privileges
and
send
us
all
to
the
less
remote
parts
of
siberia
would
be
an
easy
thing
for
them
well
if
it
is
so
and
if
everything
depends
on
the
procureur
and
others
who
can
at
will
either
enforce
the
laws
or
not
what
are
the
trials
for
the
advocate
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
you
do
put
strange
questions
my
dear
sir
that
is
philosophy
well
we
might
have
a
talk
about
that
too
could
you
come
on
saturday
you
will
meet
men
of
science
literary
men
and
artists
at
my
house
and
then
we
might
discuss
these
general
questions
said
the
advocate
pronouncing
the
words
general
questions
with
ironical
pathos
you
have
met
my
wife
do
come
thank
you
i
will
try
to
said
nekhludoff
and
felt
that
he
was
saying
an
untruth
and
knew
that
if
he
tried
to
do
anything
it
would
be
to
keep
away
froth
the
advocates
literary
evening
and
the
circle
of
the
men
of
science
art
and
literature
the
laugh
with
which
the
advocate
met
nekhludoffs
remark
that
trials
could
have
no
meaning
if
the
judges
might
enforce
the
laws
or
not
according
to
their
notion
and
the
tone
with
which
he
pronounced
the
words
philosophy
and
general
questions
proved
to
nekhludoff
how
very
differently
he
and
the
advocate
and
probably
the
advocates
friends
looked
at
things
and
he
felt
that
in
spite
of
the
distance
that
now
existed
between
himself
and
his
former
companions
schonbock
etc
the
difference
between
himself
and
the
circle
of
the
advocate
and
his
friends
was
still
greater
chapter
xii
why
the
peasants
flock
to
town
the
prison
was
a
long
way
off
and
it
was
getting
late
so
nekhludoff
took
an
isvostchik
the
isvostchik
a
middleaged
man
with
an
intelligent
and
kind
face
turned
round
towards
nekhludoff
as
they
were
driving
along
one
of
the
streets
and
pointed
to
a
huge
house
that
was
being
built
there
just
see
what
a
tremendous
house
they
have
begun
to
build
he
said
as
if
he
was
partly
responsible
for
the
building
of
the
house
and
proud
of
it
the
house
was
really
immense
and
was
being
built
in
a
very
original
style
the
strong
pine
beams
of
the
scaffolding
were
firmly
fixed
together
with
iron
bands
and
a
plank
wall
separated
the
building
from
the
street
on
the
boards
of
the
scaffolding
workmen
all
bespattered
with
plaster
moved
hither
and
thither
like
ants
some
were
laying
bricks
some
hewing
stones
some
carrying
up
the
heavy
hods
and
pails
and
bringing
them
down
empty
a
fat
and
finelydressed
gentlemanprobably
the
architectstood
by
the
scaffolding
pointing
upward
and
explaining
something
to
a
contractor
a
peasant
from
the
vladimir
government
who
was
respectfully
listening
to
him
empty
carts
were
coming
out
of
the
gate
by
which
the
architect
and
the
contractor
were
standing
and
loaded
ones
were
going
in
and
how
sure
they
all
arethose
that
do
the
work
as
well
as
those
that
make
them
do
itthat
it
ought
to
be
that
while
their
wives
at
home
who
are
with
child
are
labouring
beyond
their
strength
and
their
children
with
the
patchwork
caps
doomed
soon
to
the
cold
grave
smile
with
suffering
and
contort
their
little
legs
they
must
be
building
this
stupid
and
useless
palace
for
some
stupid
and
useless
personone
of
those
who
spoil
and
rob
them
nekhludoff
thought
while
looking
at
the
house
yes
it
is
a
stupid
house
he
said
uttering
his
thought
out
aloud
why
stupid
replied
the
isvostchik
in
an
offended
tone
thanks
to
it
the
people
get
work
its
not
stupid
but
the
work
is
useless
it
cant
be
useless
or
why
should
it
be
done
said
the
isvostchik
the
people
get
bread
by
it
nekhludoff
was
silent
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
talk
because
of
the
clatter
the
wheels
made
when
they
came
nearer
the
prison
and
the
isvostchik
turned
off
the
paved
on
to
the
macadamised
road
it
became
easier
to
talk
and
he
again
turned
to
nekhludoff
and
what
a
lot
of
these
people
are
flocking
to
the
town
nowadays
its
awful
he
said
turning
round
on
the
box
and
pointing
to
a
party
of
peasant
workmen
who
were
coming
towards
them
carrying
saws
axes
sheepskins
coats
and
bags
strapped
to
their
shoulders
more
than
in
other
years
nekhludoff
asked
by
far
this
year
every
place
is
crowded
so
that
its
just
terrible
the
employers
just
fling
the
workmen
about
like
chaff
not
a
job
to
be
got
why
is
that
theyve
increased
theres
no
room
for
them
well
what
if
they
have
increased
why
do
not
they
stay
in
the
village
theres
nothing
for
them
to
do
in
the
villageno
land
to
be
had
nekhludoff
felt
as
one
does
when
touching
a
sore
place
it
feels
as
if
the
bruised
part
was
always
being
hit
yet
it
is
only
because
the
place
is
sore
that
the
touch
is
felt
is
it
possible
that
the
same
thing
is
happening
everywhere
he
thought
and
began
questioning
the
isvostchik
about
the
quantity
of

his
village
how
much
land
the

chapter
xiii
nurse
maslova
when
he
rang
the
bell
at
the
front
entrance
nekhludoffs
heart
stood
still
with
horror
as
he
thought
of
the
state
he
might
find
maslova
in
today
and
at
the
mystery
that
he
felt
to
be
in
her
and
in
the
people
that
were
collected
in
the
prison
he
asked
the
jailer
who
opened
the
door
for
maslova
after
making
the
necessary
inquiry
the
jailer
informed
him
that
she
was
in
the
hospital
nekhludoff
went
there
a
kindly
old
man
the
hospital
doorkeeper
let
him
in
at
once
and
after
asking
nekhludoff
whom
he
wanted
directed
him
to
the
childrens
ward
a
young
doctor
saturated
with
carbolic
acid
met
nekhludoff
in
the
passage
and
asked
him
severely
what
he
wanted
this
doctor
was
always
making
all
sorts
of
concessions
to
the
prisoners
and
was
therefore
continually
coming
into
conflict
with
the
prison
authorities
and
even
with
the
head
doctor
fearing
lest
nekhludoff
should
demand
something
unlawful
and
wishing
to
show
that
he
made
no
exceptions
for
any
one
he
pretended
to
be
cross
there
are
no
women
here
it
is
the
childrens
ward
he
said
yes
i
know
but
a
prisoner
has
been
removed
here
to
be
an
assistant
nurse
yes
there
are
two
such
here
then
whom
do
you
want
i
am
closely
connected
with
one
of
them
named
maslova
nekhludoff
answered
and
should
like
to
speak
to
her
i
am
going
to
petersburg
to
hand
in
an
appeal
to
the
senate
about
her
case
and
should
like
to
give
her
this
it
is
only
a
photo
nekhludoff
said
taking
an
envelope
out
of
his
pocket
all
right
you
may
do
that
said
the
doctor
relenting
and
turning
to
an
old
woman
with
a
white
apron
he
told
her
to
call
the
prisonernurse
maslova
will
you
take
a
seat
or
go
into
the
waitingroom
thanks
said
nekhludoff
and
profiting
by
the
favourable
change
in
the
manner
of
the
doctor
towards
him
asked
how
they
were
satisfied
with
maslova
in
the
hospital
oh
she
is
all
right
she
works
fairly
well
if
you
the
conditions
of
her
former
life
into
account
but
here
she
is
the
old
nurse
came
in
at
one
of
the
doors
followed
by
maslova
who
wore
a
blue
striped
dress
a
white
apron
a
kerchief
that
quite
covered
her
hair
when
she
saw
nekhludoff
her
face
flushed
and
she
stopped
as
if
hesitating
then
frowned
and
with
downcast
eyes
went
quickly
towards
him
along
the
strip
of
carpet
in
the
middle
of
the
passage
when
she
came
up
to
nekhludoff
she
did
not
wish
to
give
him
her
hand
and
then
gave
it
growing
redder
still
nekhludoff
had
not
seen
her
since
the
day
when
she
begged
forgiveness
for
having
been
in
a
passion
and
he
expected
to
find
her
the
same
as
she
was
then
but
today
she
was
quite
different
there
was
something
new
in
the
expression
of
her
face
reserve
and
shyness
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
animosity
towards
him
he
told
her
what
he
had
already
said
to
the
doctor
ie
that
he
was
going
to
petersburg
and
he
handed
her
the
envelope
with
the
photograph
which
he
had
brought
from
panovo
i
found
this
in
panovoits
an
old
photo
perhaps
you
would
like
it
take
it
lifting
her
dark
eyebrows
she
looked
at
him
with
surprise
in
her
squinting
eyes
as
if
asking
what
is
this
for
took
the
photo
silently
and
put
it
in
the
bib
of
her
apron
i
saw
your
aunt
there
said
nekhludoff
did
you
she
said
indifferently
are
you
all
right
here
nekhludoff
asked
oh
yes
its
all
right
she
said
not
too
difficult
oh
no
but
i
am
not
used
to
it
yet
i
am
glad
for
your
sake
anyhow
it
is
better
than
there
than
wherethere
she
asked
her
face
flushing
again
therein
the
prison
nekhludoff
hurriedly
answered
why
better
she
asked
i
think
the
people
are
better
here
are
none
such
as
there
must
be
there
there
are
many
good
ones
there
she
said
i
have
been
seeing
about
the
menshoffs
and
hope
they
will
be
liberated
said
nekhludoff
god
grant
they
may
such
a
splendid
old
woman
she
said
again
repeating
her
opinion
of
the
old
woman
and
slightly
smiling
i
am
going
to
petersburg
today
your
case
will
come
on
soon
and
i
hope
the
sentence
will
be
repealed
whether
it
is
repealed
or
not
wont
matter
now
she
said
why
not
now
so
she
said
looking
with
a
quick
questioning
glance
into
his
eyes
nekhludoff
understood
the
word
and
the
look
to
mean
that
she
wished
to
know
whether
he
still
kept
firm
to
his
decision
or
had
accepted
her
refusal
i
do
not
know
why
it
does
not
matter
to
you
he
said
it
certainly
does
not
matter
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
whether
you
are
acquitted
or
not
i
am
ready
to
do
what
i
told
you
in
any
case
he
said
decidedly
she
lifted
her
head
and
her
black
squinting
eyes
remained
fixed
on
him
and
beyond
him
and
her
face
beamed
with
joy
but
the
words
she
spoke
were
very
different
from
what
her
eyes
said
you
should
not
speak
like
that
she
said
i
am
saying
it
so
that
you
should
know
everything
has
been
said
about
that
and
there
is
no
use
speaking
she
said
with
difficulty
repressing
a
smile
a
sudden
noise
came
from
the
hospital
ward
and
the
sound
of
a
child
crying
i
think
they
are
calling
me
she
said
and
looked
round
uneasily
well
goodbye
then
he
said
she
pretended
not
to
see
his
extended
hand
and
without
taking
it
turned
away
and
hastily
walked
along
the
strip
of
carpet
trying
to
hide
the
triumph
she
felt
what
is
going
on
in
her
what
is
she
thinking
what
does
she
feel
does
she
mean
to
prove
me
or
can
she
really
not
forgive
me
is
it
that
she
cannot
or
that
she
will
not
express
what
she
feels
and
thinks
has
she
softened
or
hardened
he
asked
himself
and
could
find
no
answer
he
only
knew
that
she
had
altered
and
that
an
important
change
was
going
on
in
her
soul
and
this
change
united
him
not
only
to
her
but
also
to
him
for
whose
sake
that
change
was
being
wrought
and
this
union
brought
on
a
state
of
joyful
animation
and
tenderness
when
she
returned
to
the
ward
in
which
there
stood
eight
small
beds
maslova
began
in
obedience
to
the
nurses
order
to
arrange
one
of
the
beds
and
bending
over
too
far
with
the
sheet
she
slipped
and
nearly
fell
down
a
little
convalescent
boy
with
a
bandaged
neck
who
was
looking
at
her
laughed
maslova
could
no
longer
contain
herself
and
burst
into
loud
laughter
and
such
contagious
laughter
that
several
of
the
children
also
burst
out
laughing
and
one
of
the
sisters
rebuked
her
angrily
what
are
you
giggling
at
do
you
think
you
are
where
you
used
to
be
go
and
fetch
the
food
maslova
obeyed
and
went
where
she
was
sent
but
catching
the
eye
of
the
bandaged
boy
who
was
not
allowed
to
laugh
she
again
burst
out
laughing
whenever
she
was
alone
maslova
again
and
again
pulled
the
photograph
partly
out
of
the
envelope
and
looked
at
it
admiringly
but
only
in
the
evening
when
she
was
off
duty
and
alone
in
the
bedroom
which
she
shared
with
a
nurse
did
she
take
it
quite
out
of
the
envelope
and
gaze
long
at
the
faded
yellow
photograph
caressing
with
her
eyes
every
detail
of
faces
and
clothing
the
steps
of
the
veranda
and
the
bushes
which
served
as
a
background
to
his
and
hers
and
his
aunts
faces
and
could
not
cease
from
admiring
especially
herselfher
pretty
young
face
with
the
curly
hair
round
the
forehead
she
was
so
absorbed
that
she
did
not
hear
her
fellownurse
come
into
the
room
what
is
it
that
hes
given
you
said
the
goodnatured
fat
nurse
stooping
over
the
photograph
whos
this
you
who
else
said
maslova
looking
into
her
companions
face
with
a
smile
and
whos
this
himself
and
is
this
his
mother
no
his
aunt
would
you
not
have
known
me
never
the
whole
face
is
altered
why
it
must
be
10
years
since
then
not
years
but
a
lifetime
said
maslova
and
suddenly
her
animation
went
her
face
grew
gloomy
and
a
deep
line
appeared
between
her
brows
why
so
your
way
of
life
must
have
been
an
easy
one
easy
indeed
maslova
reiterated
closing
her
eyes
and
shaking
her
head
it
is
hell
why
what
makes
it
so
what
makes
it
so
from
eight
till
four
in
the
morning
and
every
night
the
same
then
why
dont
they
give
it
up
they
cant
give
it
up
if
they
want
to
but
whats
the
use
of
talking
maslova
said
jumping
up
and
throwing
the
photograph
into
the
drawer
of
the
table
and
with
difficulty
repressing
angry
tears
she
ran
out
into
the
passage
and
slammed
the
door
while
looking
at
the
group
she
imagined
herself
such
as
she
was
there
and
dreamt
of
her
happiness
then
and
of
the
possibility
of
happiness
with
him
now
but
her
companions
words
reminded
her
of
what
she
was
now
and
what
she
had
been
and
brought
back
all
the
horrors
of
that
life
which
she
had
felt
but
dimly
and
not
allowed
herself
to
realise
it
was
only
now
that
the
memory
of
all
those
terrible
nights
came
vividly
back
to
her
especially
one
during
the
carnival
when
she
was
expecting
a
student
who
had
promised
to
buy
her
out
she
remembered
how
shewearing
her
low
necked
silk
dress
stained
with
wine
a
red
bow
in
her
untidy
hair
wearied
weak
half
tipsy
having
seen
her
visitors
off
sat
down
during
an
interval
in
the
dancing
by
the
piano
beside
the
bony
pianiste
with
the
blotchy
face
who
played
the
accompaniments
to
the
violin
and
began
complaining
of
her
hard
fate
and
how
this
pianiste
said
that
she
too
was
feeling
how
heavy
her
position
was
and
would
like
to
change
it
and
how
clara
suddenly
came
up
to
them
and
how
they
all
three
decided
to
change
their
life
they
thought
that
the
night
was
over
and
were
about
to
go
away
when
suddenly
the
noise
of
tipsy
voices
was
heard
in
the
anteroom
the
violinist
played
a
tune
and
the
pianiste
began
hammering
the
first
figure
of
a
quadrille
on
the
piano
to
the
tune
of
a
most
merry
russian
song
a
small
perspiring
man
smelling
of
spirits
with
a
white
tie
and
swallowtail
coat
which
he
took
off
after
the
first
figure
came
up
to
her
hiccoughing
and
caught
her
up
while
another
fat
man
with
a
beard
and
also
wearing
a
dresscoat
they
had
come
straight
from
a
ball
caught
clara
up
and
for
a
long
time
they
turned
danced
screamed
drank



and
so
it
went
on
for
another
year
and
another
and
a
third
how
could
she
help
changing
and
he
was
the
cause
of
it
all
and
suddenly
all
her
former
bitterness
against
him
reawoke
she
wished
to
scold
to
reproach
him
she
regretted
having
neglected
the
opportunity
of
repeating
to
him
once
more
that
she
knew
him
and
would
not
give
in
to
himwould
not
let
him
make
use
of
her
spiritually
as
he
had
done
physically
and
she
longed
for
drink
in
order
to
stifle
the
feeling
of
pity
to
herself
and
the
useless
feeling
of
reproach
to
him
and
she
would
have
broken
her
word
if
she
had
been
inside
the
prison
here
she
could
not
get
any
spirits
except
by
applying
to
the
medical
assistant
and
she
was
afraid
of
him
because
he
made
up
to
her
and
intimate
relations
with
men
were
disgusting
to
her
now
after
sitting
a
while
on
a
form
in
the
passage
she
returned
to
her
little
room
and
without
paying
any
heed
to
her
companions
words
she
wept
for
a
long
time
over
her
wrecked
life
chapter
xiv
an
aristocratic
circle
nekhludoff
had
four
matters
to
attend
to
in
petersburg
the
first
was
the
appeal
to
the
senate
in
maslovas
case
the
second
to
hand
in
theodosia
birukoffs
petition
to
the
committee
the
third
to
comply
with
vera
doukhovas
requestsie
try
to
get
her
friend
shoustova
released
from
prison
and
get
permission
for
a
mother
to
visit
her
son
in
prison
vera
doukhova
had
written
to
him
about
this
and
he
was
going
to
the
gendarmerie
office
to
attend
to
these
two
matters
which
he
counted
as
one
the
fourth
matter
he
meant
to
attend
to
was
the
case
of
some
sectarians
who
had
been
separated
from
their
families
and
exiled
to
the
caucasus
because
they
read
and
discussed
the
gospels
it
was
not
so
much
to
them
as
to
himself
he
had
promised
to
do
all
he
could
to
clear
up
this
affair
since
his
last
visit
to
maslennikoff
and
especially
since
he
had
been
in
the
country
nekhludoff
had
not
exactly
formed
a
resolution
but
felt
with
his
whole
nature
a
loathing
for
that
society
in
which
he
had
lived
till
then
that
society
which
so
carefully
hides
the
sufferings
of
millions
in
order
to
assure
ease
and
pleasure
to
a
small
number
of
people
that
the
people
belonging
to
this
society
do
not
and
cannot
see
these
sufferings
nor
the
cruelty
and
wickedness
of
their
life
nekhludoff
could
no
longer
move
in
this
society
without
feeling
ill
at
ease
and
reproaching
himself
and
yet
all
the
ties
of
relationship
and
friendship
and
his
own
habits
were
drawing
him
back
into
this
society
besides
that
which
alone
interested
him
now
his
desire
to
help
maslova
and
the
other
sufferers
made
it
necessary
to
ask
for
help
and
service
from
persons
belonging
to
that
society
persons
whom
he
not
only
could
not
respect
but
who
often
aroused
in
him
indignation
and
a
feeling
of
contempt
when
he
came
to
petersburg
and
stopped
at
his
auntshis
mothers
sister
the
countess
tcharsky
wife
of
a
former
ministernekhludoff
at
once
found
himself
in
the
very
midst
of
that
aristocratic
circle
which
had
grown
so
foreign
to
him
this
was
very
unpleasant
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
getting
out
of
it
to
put
up
at
an
hotel
instead
of
at
his
aunts
house
would
have
been
to
offend
his
aunt
and
besides
his
aunt
had
important
connections
and
might
be
extremely
useful
in
all
these
matters
he
meant
to
attend
to
what
is
this
i
hear
about
you
all
sorts
of
marvels
said
the
countess
katerina
ivanovna
tcharsky
as
she
gave
him
his
coffee
immediately
after
his
arrival
vous

criminals
going

round

oh
no
i
never
thought
of
it
why
not
it
is
a
good
thing
only
there
seems
to
be
some
romantic
story
connected
with
it
let
us
hear
all
about
it
nekhludoff
told
her
the
whole
truth
about
his
relations
to
maslova
yes
yes
i
remember
your
poor
mother
telling
me
about
it
that
was
when
you
were
staying
with
those
old
women
i
believe
they
wished
to
marry
you
to
their
ward
the
countess
katerina
ivanovna
had
always
despised
nekhludoffs
aunts
on
his
fathers
side
so
its
she
elle
est
encore
jolie
katerina
ivanovna
was
a
strong
bright
energetic
talkative
woman
of
60
she
was
tall
and
very
stout
and
had
a
decided
black
moustache
on
her
lip
nekhludoff
was
fond
of
her
and
had
even
as
a
child
been
infected
by
her
energy
and
mirth
no
ma
tante
thats
at
an
end
i
only
wish
to
help
her
because
she
is
innocently
accused
i
am
the
cause
of
it
and
the
cause
of
her
fate
being
what
it
is
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
do
all
i
can
for
her
but
what
is
this
i
have
heard
about
your
intention
of
marrying
her
yes
it
was
my
intention
but
she
does
not
wish
it
katerina
ivanovna
looked
at
her
nephew
with
raised
brows
and
drooping
eyeballs
in
silent
amazement
suddenly
her
face
changed
and
with
a
look
of
pleasure
she
said
well
she
is
wiser
than
you
dear
me
you
are
a
fool
and
you
would
have
married
her
most
certainly
after
her
having
been
what
she
was
all
the
more
since
i
was
the
cause
of
it
well
you
are
a
simpleton
said
his
aunt
repressing
a
smile
a
terrible
simpleton
but
it
is
just
because
you
are
such
a
terrible
simpleton
that
i
love
you
she
repeated
the
word
evidently
liking
it
as
it
seemed
to
correctly
convey
to
her
mind
the
idea
of
her
nephews
moral
state
do
you
knowwhat

lucky
chance

pray
continually
but
aline

to
it
body
and
soul
so
we
shall
place
her
thereyours
i
mean
but
she
is
condemned
to
siberia
i
have
come
on
purpose
to
appeal
about
it
this
is
one
of
my
requests
to
you
dear
me
and
where
do
you
appeal
to
in
this
case
to
the
senate
ah
the
senate
yes
my
dear
cousin
leo
is
in
the
senate
but
he
is
in
the
heraldry
department
and
i
dont
know
any
of
the
real

well

same
ill
tell
my
husband
he
knows
them
he
knows
all
sorts
of
people
ill
tell
him
but
you
will
have
to
explain
he
never
understands
me
whatever
i
may
say
he
always
maintains
he
does
not
understand
it
cest

every
one
understands
but
only
not
he
at
this
moment
a
footman
with
stockinged
legs
came
in
with
a
note
on
a
silver
platter
there
now
from
aline
herself
youll
have
a
chance
of
hearing
kiesewetter
who
is
kiesewetter
kiesewetter
come
this
evening
and
you
will
find
out
who
he
is
he
speaks
in
such
a
way
that
the
most
hardened
criminals
sink
on
their
knees
and
weep
and
repent
the
countess
katerina
ivanovna
however
strange
it
may
seem
and
however
little
it
seemed
in
keeping
with
the
rest
of
her
character
was
a
staunch
adherent
to
that
teaching
which
holds
that
the
essence
of
christianity
lies
in
the
belief
in
redemption
she
went
to
meetings
where
this
teaching
then
in
fashion
was
being
preached
and
assembled
the
faithful
in
her
own
house
though
this
teaching
repudiated
all
ceremonies
icons
and
sacraments
katerina
ivanovna
had
icons
in
every
room
and
one
on
the
wall
above
her
bed
and
she
kept
all
that
the
church
prescribed
without
noticing
any
contradiction
in
that
there
now
if
your
magdalene
could
hear
him
she
would
be
converted
said
the
countess
do
stay
at
home
tonight
you
will
hear
him
he
is
a
wonderful
man
it
does
not
interest
me
ma
tante
but
i
tell
you
that
it
is
interesting
and
you
must
come
home
now
you
may
go
what
else
do
you
want
of
me
videz

the
next
is
in
the
fortress
in
the
fortress
i
can
give
you
a
note
for
that
to
the
baron
kriegsmuth
cest
un
tres
brave
homme
oh
but
you
know
him
he
was
a
comrade
of
your
fathers
il
donne
dans
le
spiritisme
but
that
does
not
matter
he
is
a
good
fellow
what
do
you
want
there
i
want
to
get
leave
for
a
mother
to
visit
her
son
who
is
imprisoned
there
but
i
was
told
that
this
did
not
depend
on
kriegsmuth
but
on
tcherviansky
i
do
not
like
tcherviansky
but
he
is
mariettes
husband
we
might
ask
her
she
will
do
it
for
me
elle
est
tres
gentille
i
have
also
to
petition
for
a
woman
who
is
imprisoned
there
without
knowing
what
for
no
fear
she
knows
well
enough
they
all
know
it
very
well
and
it
serves
them
right
those
shorthaired
many
advanced
women
wear
their
hair
short
like
men
ones
we
do
not
know
whether
it
serves
them
right
or
not
but
they
suffer
you
are
a
christian
and
believe
in
the
gospel
teaching
and
yet
you
are
so
pitiless
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
gospels
are
the
gospels
but
what
is
disgusting
remains
disgusting
it
would
be
worse
if
i
pretended
to
love
nihilists
especially
shorthaired
women
nihilists
when
i
cannot
bear
them
why
can
you
not
bear
them
you
ask
why
after
the
1st
of
march
the
emperor
alexander
ii
was
killed
on
the
first
of
march
old
style
they
did
not
all
take
part
in
it
on
the
1st
of
march
never
mind
they
should
not
meddle
with
what
is
no
business
of
theirs
its
not
womens
business
yet
you
consider
that
mariette
may
take
part
in
business
mariette
mariette
is
mariette
and
these
are
goodness
knows
what
want
to
teach
everybody
not
to
teach
but
simply
to
help
the
people
one
knows
whom
to
help
and
whom
not
to
help
without
them
but
the
peasants
are
in
great
need
i
have
just
returned
from
the
country
is
it
necessary
that
the
peasants
should
work
to
the
very
limits
of
their
strength
and
never
have
sufficient
to
eat
while
we
are
living
in
the
greatest
luxury
said
nekhludoff
involuntarily
led
on
by
his
aunts
good
nature
into
telling
her
what
he
was
in
his
thoughts
what
do
you
want
then
that
i
should
work
and
not
eat
anything
no
i
do
not
wish
you
not
to
eat
i
only
wish
that
we
should
all
work
and
all
eat
he
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
said
it
again
raising
her
brow
and
drooping
her
eyeballs
his
aunt
looked
at
him
curiously
mon
cher
vous
finirez
mal
she
said
just
then
the
general
and
former
minister
countess
tcharskys
husband
a
tall
broadshouldered
man
came
into
the
room
ah
dmitri
how
dyou
do
he
said
turning
his
freshlyshaved
cheek
to
nekhludoff
to
be
kissed
when
did
you
get
here
and
he

chapter
xv
an
average
statesman
count
ivan
michaelovitch
had
been
a
minister
and
was
a
man
of
strong
convictions
the
convictions
of
count
ivan
michaelovitch
consisted
in
the
belief
that
just
as
it
was
natural
for
a
bird
to
feed
on
worms
to
be
clothed
in
feathers
and
down
and
to
fly
in
the
air
so
it
was
natural
for
him
to
feed
on
the
choicest
and
most
expensive
food
prepared
by
highlypaid
cooks
to
wear
the
most
comfortable
and
most
expensive
clothing
to
drive
with
the
best
and
fastest
horses
and
that
therefore
all
these
things
should
be
ready
found
for
him
besides
this
count
ivan
michaelovitch
considered
that
the
more
money
he
could
get
out
of
the
treasury
by
all
sorts
of
means
the
more
orders
he
had
including
different
diamond
insignia
of
something
or
other
and
the
oftener
he
spoke
to
highlyplaced
individuals
of
both
sexes
so
much
the
better
it
was
all
the
rest
count
ivan
michaelovitch
considered
insignificant
and
uninteresting
beside
these
dogmas
all
the
rest
might
be
as
it
was
or
just
the
reverse
count
ivan
michaelovitch
lived
and
acted
according
to
these
lights
for
40
years
and
at
the
end
of
40
years
reached
the
position
of
a
minister
of
state
the
chief
qualities
that
enabled
count
ivan
michaelovitch
to
reach
this
position
were
his
capacity
of
understanding
the
meaning
of
documents
and
laws
and
of
drawing
up
though
clumsily
intelligible
state
papers
and
of
spelling
them
correctly
secondly
his
very
stately
appearance
which
enabled
him
when
necessary
to
seem
not
only
extremely
proud
but
unapproachable
and
majestic
while
at
other
times
he
could
be
abjectly
and
almost
passionately
servile
thirdly
the
absence
of
any
general
principles
or
rules
either
of
personal
or
administrative
morality
which
made
it
possible
for
him
either
to
agree
or
disagree
with
anybody
according
to
what
was
wanted
at
the
time
when
acting
thus
his
only
endeavour
was
to
sustain
the
appearance
of
good
breeding
and
not
to
seem
too
plainly
inconsistent
as
for
his
actions
being
moral
or
not
in
themselves
or
whether
they
were
going
to
result
in
the
highest
welfare
or
greatest
evil
for
the
whole
of
the
russian
empire
or
even
the
entire
world
that
was
quite
indifferent
to
him
when
he
became
minister
not
only
those
dependent
on
him
and
there
were
great
many
of
them
and
people
connected
with
him
but
many
strangers
and
even
he
himself
were
convinced
that
he
was
a
very
clever
statesman
but
after
some
time
had
elapsed
and
he
had
done
nothing
and
had
nothing
to
show
and
when
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
struggle
for
existence
others
like
himself
who
had
learnt
to
write
and
understand
documents
stately
and
unprincipled
officials
had
displaced
him
he
turned
out
to
be
not
only
far
from
clever
but
very
limited
and
badly
educated
though
selfassured
his
views
hardly
reaching
the
level
of
those
in
the
leading
articles
of
the
conservative
papers
it
became
apparent
that
there
was
nothing
in
him
to
distinguish
him
from
those
other
badlyeducated
and
selfassured
officials
who
had
pushed
him
out
and
he
himself
saw
it
but
this
did
not
shake
his
conviction
that
he
had
to
receive
a
great
deal
of
money
out
of
the
treasury
every
year
and
new
decorations
for
his
dress
clothes
this
conviction
was
so
firm
that
no
one
had
the
pluck
to
refuse
these
things
to
him
and
he
received
yearly
partly
in
form
of
a
pension
partly
as
a
salary
for
being
a
member
in
a
government
institution
and
chairman
of
all
sorts
of
committees
and
councils
several
tens
of
thousands
of
roubles
besides
the
righthighly
prized
by
himof
sewing
all
sorts
of
new
cords
to
his
shoulders
and
trousers
and
ribbons
to
wear
under
and
enamel
stars
to
fix
on
to
his
dress
coat
in
consequence
of
this
count
ivan
michaelovitch
had
very
high
connections
count
ivan
michaelovitch
listened
to
nekhludoff
as
he
was
wont
to
listen
to
the
reports
of
the
permanent
secretary
of
his
department
and
having
heard
him
said
he
would
give
him
two
notes
one
to
the
senator
wolff
of
the
appeal
department
all
sorts
of
things
are
reported
of
him
but
dans
tous
les
cas
cest
un
homme
tres
comme
ii
faut
he
said
he
is
indebted
to
me
and
will
do
all
that
is
possible
the
other
note
count
ivan
michaelovitch
gave
nekhludoff
was
to
an
influential
member
of
the
petition
committee
the
story
of
theodosia
birukoff
as
told
by
nekhludoff
interested
him
very
much
when
nekhludoff
said
that
he
thought
of
writing
to
the
empress
the
count
replied
that
it
certainly
was
a
very
touching
story
and
might
if
occasion
presented
itself
he
told
her
but
he
could
not
promise
let
the
petition
be
handed
in
in
due
form
should
there
be
an
opportunity
and
if
a
petit
comite
were
called
on
thursday
he
thought
he
would
tell
her
the
story
as
soon
as
nekhludoff
had
received
these
two
notes
and
a
note
to
mariette
from
his
aunt
he
at
once
set
off
to
these
different
places
first
he
went
to
mariettes
he
had
known
her
as
a
halfgrown
girl
the
daughter
of
an
aristocratic
but
not
wealthy
family
and
had
heard
how
she
had
married
a
man
who
was
making
a
career
whom
nekhludoff
had
heard
badly
spoken
of
and
as
usual
he
felt
it
hard
to
ask
a
favour
of
a
man
he
did
not
esteem
in
these
cases
he
always
felt
an
inner
dissension
and
dissatisfaction
and
wavered
whether
to
ask
the
favour
or
not
and
always
resolved
to
ask
besides
feeling
himself
in
a
false
position
among
those
to
whose
set
he
no
longer
regarded
himself
as
belonging
who
yet
regarded
him
as
belonging
to
them
he
felt
himself
getting
into
the
old
accustomed
rut
and
in
spite
of
himself
fell
into
the
thoughtless
and
immoral
tone
that
reigned
in
that
circle
he
felt
that
from
the
first
with
his
aunt
he
involuntarily
fell
into
a
bantering
tone
while
talking
about
serious
matters
petersburg
in
general

him
with
its
usual
physically
invigorating
and
mentally
dulling
effect
everything
so
clean
so
comfortably
wellarranged
and
the
people
so
lenient
in
moral
matters
that
life
seemed
very
easy
a
fine
clean

polite

him
past
fine
clean
polite
policemen
along
the
fine

past

clean
houses
to
the
house
in
which
mariette
lived
at
the
front
door
stood
a
pair
of
english
horses
with
english
harness
and
an
englishlooking
coachman
on
the
box
with
the
lower
part
of
his
face
shaved
proudly
holding
a
whip
the
doorkeeper
dressed
in
a
wonderfully
clean
livery
opened
the
door
into
the
hall
where
in
still
cleaner
livery
with
gold
cords
stood
the
footman
with
his
splendid
whiskers
well
combed
out
and
the
orderly
on
duty
in
a
brandnew
uniform
the
general
does
not
receive
and
the
generaless
does
not
receive
either
she
is
just
going
to
drive
out
nekhludoff
took
out
katerina
ivanovnas
letter
and
going
up
to
a
table
on
which
lay
a
visitors
book
began
to
write
that
he
was
sorry
not
to
have
been
able
to
see
any
one
when
the
footman
went
up
the
staircase
the
doorkeeper
went
out
and
shouted
to
the
coachman
and
the
orderly
stood
up
rigid
with
his
arms
at
his
sides
following
with
his
eyes
a
little
slight
lady
who
was
coming
down
the
stairs
with
rapid
steps
not
in
keeping
with
all
the
grandeur
mariette
had
a
large
hat
on
with
feathers
a
black
dress
and
cape
and
new
black
gloves
her
face
was
covered
by
a
veil
when
she
saw
nekhludoff
she
lifted
the
veil
off
a
very
pretty
face
with
bright
eyes
that
looked
inquiringly
at
him
ah
prince
dmitri
ivanovitch
nekhludoff
she
said
with
a
soft
pleasant
voice
i
should
have
known
what
you
even
remember
my
name
i
should
think
so
why

my
sisters

even
been
in
love
with

she
said
in
french
but

have
altered

a
pity

have
to
go
out
but
let
us
go
up
again
she
said
and
stopped
hesitatingly
then
she
looked
at
the
clock
no
i
cant
i
am
going
to
kamenskayas
to

she
said
and
went
to
the
door
with
quick
light
steps
i
cannot
come
tonight
he
said
going
out
after
her
but
i
have
a
request
to
make
you
and
he
looked
at
the
pair
of
bays
that
were
drawing
up
to
the
front
door
what
is
this
this
is
a
letter
from
aunt
to

nekhludoff
handing
her
a
narrow
envelope
with
a
large
crest
youll

but
of
course

i
am
willing
to
be
false
to
my
principle
what

this
business
about
she
said
searching
in
vain
for
her
pocket
with
her
little
black
gloved
hand
there
is
a
girl
imprisoned
in
the
fortress
and
she
is
ill
and
innocent
what
is
her
name
lydia
shoustova
its
in
the
note
all
right
ill
see
what
i
can
do
she
said
and
lightly
jumped
into
her
little
softly
upholstered
open
carriage
its
brightlyvarnished
splashguards
glistening
in
the
sunshine
and
opened
her
parasol
the
footman
got
on
the
box
and
gave
the
coachman
a
sign
the
carriage
moved
but
at
that
moment
she
touched
the
coachman
with
her
parasol
and
the
slimlegged
beauties
the
bay
mares
stopped
bending
their
beautiful
necks
and
stepping
from
foot
to
foot
but
you
must
come
only
please
without
interested
motives
and
she
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
the
force
of
which
she
well
knew
and
as
if
the
performance
over
and
she
were
drawing
the
curtain
she
dropped
the
veil
over
her
face
again
all
right
and
she
again
touched
the
coachman
nekhludoff
raised
his
hat
and
the
wellbred
bays
slightly
snorting
set
off
their
shoes
clattering
on
the
pavement
and
the
carriage
rolled
quickly
and
smoothly
on
its
new
rubber
tyres
giving
a
jump
only
now
and
then
over
some
unevenness
of
the
road
chapter
xvi
an
uptodate
senator
when
nekhludoff
remembered
the
smiles
that
had
passed
between
him
and
mariette
he
shook
his
head
you
have
hardly
time
to
turn
round
before
you
are
again
drawn
into
this
life
he
thought
feeling
that
discord
and
those
doubts
which
the
necessity
to
curry
favour
from
people
he
did
not
esteem
caused
after
considering
where
to
go
first
so
as
not
to
have
to
retrace
his
steps
nekhludoff
set
off
for
the
senate
there
he
was
shown
into
the
office
where
he
found
a
great
many
very
polite
and
very
clean
officials
in
the
midst
of
a
magnificent
apartment
maslovas
petition
was
received
and
handed
on
to
that
wolf
to
whom
nekhludoff
had
a
letter
from
his
uncle
to
be
examined
and
reported
on
there
will
be
a
meeting
of
the
senate
this
week
the
official
said
to
nekhludoff
but
maslovas
case
will
hardly
come
before
that
meeting
it
might
come
before
the
meeting
on
wednesday
by
special
request
one
of
the
officials
remarked
during
the
time
nekhludoff
waited
in
the
office
while
some
information
was
being
taken
he
heard
that
the
conversation
in
the
senate
was
all
about
the
duel
and
he
heard
a
detailed
account
of
how
a
young
man
kaminski
had
been
killed
it
was
here
he
first
heard
all
the
facts
of
the
case
which
was
exciting
the
interest
of
all
petersburg
the
story
was
this
some
officers
were
eating
oysters
and
as
usual
drinking
very
much
when
one
of
them
said
something
illnatured
about
the
regiment
to
which
kaminski
belonged
and
kaminski
called
him
a
liar
the
other
hit
kaminski
the
next
day
they
fought
kaminski
was
wounded
in
the
stomach
and
died
two
hours
later
the
murderer
and
the
seconds
were
arrested
but
it
was
said
that
though
they
were
arrested
and
in
the
guardhouse
they
would
be
set
free
in
a
fortnight
from
the
senate
nekhludoff
drove
to
see
an
influential
member
of
the
petition
committee
baron
vorobioff
who
lived
in
a
splendid
house
belonging
to
the
crown
the
doorkeeper
told
nekhludoff
in
a
severe
tone
that
the
baron
could
not
be
seen
except
on
his
reception
days
that
he
was
with
his
majesty
the
emperor
today
and
the
next
day
he
would
again
have
to
deliver
a
report
nekhludoff
left
his
uncles
letter
with
the
doorkeeper
and
went
on
to
see
the
senator
wolf
wolf
had
just
had
his
lunch
and
was
as
usual
helping
digestion
by
smoking
a
cigar
and
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
when
nekhludoff
came
in
vladimir
vasilievitch
wolf
was
certainly
un
homme
tres
comme
il
faut
and
prized
this
quality
very
highly
and
from
that
elevation
he
looked
down
at
everybody
else
he
could
not
but
esteem
this
quality
of
his
very
highly
because
it
was
thanks
to
it
alone
that
he
had
made
a
brilliant
career
the
very
career
he
desired
ie
by
marriage
he
obtained
a
fortune
which
brought
him
in
18000
roubles
a
year
and
by
his
own
exertions
the
post
of
a
senator
he
considered
himself
not
only
un
homme
tres
comme
il
faut
but
also
a
man
of
knightly
honour
by
honour
he
understood
not
accepting
secret
bribes
from
private
persons
but
he
did
not
consider
it
dishonest
to
beg
money
for
payment
of
fares
and
all
sorts
of
travelling
expenses
from
the
crown
and
to
do
anything
the
government
might
require
of
him
in
return
to
ruin
hundreds
of
innocent
people
to
cause
them
to
be
imprisoned
to
be
exiled
because
of
their
love
for
their
people
and
the
religion
of
their
fathers
as
he
had
done
in
one
of
the
governments
of
poland
when
he
was
governor
there
he
did
not
consider
it
dishonourable
but
even
thought
it
a
noble
manly
and
patriotic
action
nor
did
he
consider
it
dishonest
to
rob
his
wife
and
sisterinlaw
as
he
had
done
but
thought
it
a
wise
way
of
arranging
his
family
life
his
family
consisted
of
his
commonplace
wife
his
sisterinlaw
whose
fortune
he
had
appropriated
by
selling
her
estate
and
putting
the
money
to
his
account
and
his
meek
frightened
plain
daughter
who
lived
a
lonely
weary
life
from
which
she
had
lately
begun
to
look
for
relaxation
in
evangelicism
attending
meetings
at
alines
and
the
countess
katerina
ivanovna
wolfs
son
who
had
grown
a
beard
at
the
age
of
15
and
had
at
that
age
begun
to
drink
and
lead
a
depraved
life
which
he
continued
to
do
till
the
age
of
20
when
he
was
turned
out
by
his
father
because
he
never
finished
his
studies
moved
in
a
low
set
and
made
debts
which
committed
the
father
the
father
had
once
paid
a
debt
of
250
roubles
for
his
son
then
another
of
600
roubles
but
warned
the
son
that
he
did
it
for
the
last
time
and
that
if
the
son
did
not
reform
he
would
be
turned
out
of
the
house
and
all
further
intercourse
between
him
and
his
family
would
he
put
a
stop
to
the
son
did
not
reform
but
made
a
debt
of
a
thousand
roubles
and
took
the
liberty
of
telling
his
father
that
life
at
home
was
a
torment
anyhow
then
wolf
declared
to
his
son
that
he
might
go
where
he
pleasedthat
he
was
no
son
of
his
any
longer
since
then
wolf
pretended
he
had
no
son
and
no
one
at
home
dared
speak
to
him
about
his
son
and
vladimir
vasilievitch
wolf
was
firmly
convinced
that
he
had
arranged
his
family
life
in
the
best
way
wolf
stopped
pacing
up
and
down
his
study
and
greeted
nekhludoff
with
a
friendly
though
slightly
ironical
smile
this
was
his
way
of
showing
how
comme
il
faut
he
was
and
how
superior
to
the
majority
of
men
he
read
the
note
which
nekhludoff
handed
to
him
please
take
a
seat
and
excuse
me
if
i
continue
to
walk
up
and
down
with
your
permission
he
said
putting
his
hands
into
his
coat
pockets
and
began
again
to
walk
with
light
soft
steps
across
his
large
quietly
and
stylishly
furnished
study
very
pleased
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
of
course
very
glad
to
do
anything
that
count
ivan
michaelovitch
wishes
he
said
blowing
the
fragrant
blue
smoke
out
of
his
mouth
and
removing
his
cigar
carefully
so
as
not
to
drop
the
ash
i
should
only
like
to
ask
that
the
case
might
come
on
soon
so
that
if
the
prisoner
has
to
go
to
siberia
she
might
set
off
early
said
nekhludoff
yes
yes
with
one
of
the
first
steamers
from
nijni
i
know
said
wolf
with
his
patronising
smile
always
knowing
in
advance
whatever
one
wanted
to
tell
him
what
is
the
prisoners
name
maslova
wolf
went
up
to
the
table
and
looked
at
a
paper
that
lay
on
a
piece
of
cardboard
among
other
business
papers
yes
yes
maslova
all
right
i
will
ask
the
others
we
shall
hear
the
case
on
wednesday
then
may
i
telegraph
to
the
advocate
the
advocate
whats
that
for
but
if
you
like
why
not
the
causes
for
appeal
may
be
insufficient
said
nekhludoff
but
i
think
the
case
will
show
that
the
sentence
was
passed
owing
to
a
misunderstanding
yes
yes
it
may
be
so
but
the
senate
cannot
decide
the
case
on
its
merits
said
wolf
looking
seriously
at
the
ash
of
his
cigar
the
senate
only
considers
the
exactness
of
the
application
of
the
laws
and
their
right
interpretation
but
this
seems
to
me
to
be
an
exceptional
case
i
know
i
know
all
cases
are
exceptional
we
shall
do
our
duty
thats
all
the
ash
was
still
holding
on
but
had
began
breaking
and
was
in
danger
of
falling
do
you
often
come
to
petersburg
said
wolf
holding
his
cigar
so
that
the
ash
should
not
fall
but
the
ash
began
to
shake
and
wolf
carefully
carried
it
to
the
ashpan
into
which
it
fell
what
a
terrible
thing
this
is
with
regard
to
kaminski
he
said
a
splendid
young
man
the
only
son
especially
the
mothers
position
he
went
on
repeating
almost
word
for
word
what
every
one
in
petersburg
was
at
that
time
saying
about
kaminski
wolf
spoke
a
little
about
the
countess
katerina
ivanovna
and
her
enthusiasm
for
the
new
religious
teaching
which
he
neither
approved
nor
disapproved
of
but
which
was
evidently
needless
to
him
who
was
so
comme
il
faut
and
then
rang
the
bell
nekhludoff
bowed
if
it
is
convenient
come
and
dine
on
wednesday
and
i
will
give
you
a
decisive
answer
said
wolf
extending
his
hand
it
was
late
and
nekhludoff
returned
to
his
aunts

countess
katerina
ivanovnas
dinner
hour
was
halfpast
seven
and
the
dinner
was
served
in
a
new
manner
that
nekhludoff
had
not
yet
seen
anywhere
after
they
had
placed
the
dishes
on
the
table
the
waiters
left
the
room
and
the
diners
helped
themselves
the
men
would
not
let
the
ladies
take
the
trouble
of
moving
and
as
befitted
the
stronger
sex
they
manfully
took
on
themselves
the
burden
of
putting
the
food
on
the
ladies
plates
and
of
filling
their
glasses
when
one
course
was
finished
the
countess
pressed
the
button
of
an
electric
bell
fitted
to
the
table
and
the
waiters
stepped
in
noiselessly
and
quickly
carried
away
the
dishes
changed
the
plates
and
brought
in
the
next
course
the
dinner
was
very
refined
the
wines
very
costly
a
french
chef
was
working
in
the
large
light
kitchens
with
two
whiteclad
assistants
there
were
six
persons
at
dinner
the
count
and
countess
their
son
a
surly
officer
in
the
guards
who
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
nekhludoff
a
french
lady
reader
and
the
counts
chief
steward
who
had
come
up
from
the
country
here
too
the
conversation
was
about
the
duel
and
opinions
were
given
as
to
how
the
emperor
regarded
the
case
it
was
known
that
the
emperor
was
very
much
grieved
for
the
mothers
sake
and
all
were
grieved
for
her
and
as
it
was
also
known
that
the
emperor
did
not
mean
to
be
very
severe
to
the
murderer
who
defended
the
honour
of
his
uniform
all
were
also
lenient
to
the
officer
who
had
defended
the
honour
of
his
uniform
only
the
countess
katerina
ivanovna
with
her
free
thoughtlessness
expressed
her
disapproval
they
get
drunk
and
kill
unobjectionable
young
men
i
should
not
forgive
them
on
any
account
she
said
now
thats
a
thing
i
cannot
understand
said
the
count
i
know
that
you
never
can
understand
what
i
say
the
countess
began
and
turning
to
nekhludoff
she
added
everybody
understands
except
my
husband
i
say
i
am
sorry
for
the
mother
and
i
do
not
wish
him
to
be
contented
having
killed
a
man
then
her
son
who
had
been
silent
up
to
then
took
the
murderers
part
and
rudely
attacked
his
mother
arguing
that
an
officer
could
not
behave
in
any
other
way
because
his
fellowofficers
would
condemn
him
and
turn
him
out
of
the
regiment
nekhludoff
listened
to
the
conversation
without
joining
in
having
been
an
officer
himself
he
understood
though
he
did
not
agree
with
young
tcharskys
arguments
and
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
help
contrasting
the
fate
of
the
officer
with
that
of
a
beautiful
young
convict
whom
he
had
seen
in
the
prison
and
who
was
condemned
to
the
mines
for
having
killed
another
in
a
fight
both
had
turned
murderers
through
drunkenness
the
peasant
had
killed
a
man
in
a
moment
of
irritation
and
he
was
parted
from
his
wife
and
family
had
chains
on
his
legs
and
his
head
shaved
and
was
going
to
hard
labour
in
siberia
while
the
officer
was
sitting
in
a
fine
room
in
the
guardhouse
eating
a
good
dinner
drinking
good
wine
and
reading
books
and
would
be
set
free
in
a
day
or
two
to
live
as
he
had
done
before
having
only
become
more
interesting
by
the
affair
nekhludoff
said
what
he
had
been
thinking
and
at
first
his
aunt
katerina
ivanovna
seemed
to
agree
with
him
but
at
last
she
became
silent
as
the
rest
had
done
and
nekhludoff
felt
that
he
had
committed
something
akin
to
an
impropriety
in
the
evening
soon
after
dinner
the
large
hall
with
highbacked
carved
chairs
arranged
in
rows
as
for
a
meeting
and
an
armchair
next
to
a
little
table
with
a
bottle
of
water
for
the
speaker
began
to
fill
with
people
come
to
hear
the
foreigner
kiesewetter
preach
elegant
equipages
stopped
at
the
front
entrance
in
the
hall
sat
richlydressed
ladies
in
silks
and
velvets
and
lace
with
false
hair
and
false
busts
and
drawnin
waists
and
among
them
men
in
uniform
and
evening
dress
and
about
five
persons
of
the
common
class
ie
two
menservants
a
shopkeeper
a
footman
and
a
coachman
kiesewetter
a
thickset
grisly
man
spoke
english
and
a
thin
young
girl
with
a
pincenez
translated
it
into
russian
promptly
and
well
he
was
saying
that
our
sins
were
so
great
the
punishment
for
them
so
great
and
so
unavoidable
that
it
was
impossible
to
live
anticipating
such
punishment
beloved
brothers
and
sisters
let
us
for
a
moment
consider
what
we
are
doing
how
we
are
living
how
we
have
offended
against
the
allloving
lord
and
how
we
make
christ
suffer
and
we
cannot
but
understand
that
there
is
no
forgiveness
possible
for
us
no
escape
possible
that
we
are
all
doomed
to
perish
a
terrible
fate
awaits
useverlasting
torment
he
said
with
tears
in
his
trembling
voice
oh
how
can
we
be
saved
brothers
how
can
we
be
saved
from
this
terrible
unquenchable
fire
the
house
is
in
flames
there
is
no
escape
he
was
silent
for
a
while
and
real
tears
flowed
down
his
cheeks
it
was
for
about
eight
years
that
each
time
when
he
got
to
this
part
of
his
speech
which
he
himself
liked
so
well
he
felt
a
choking
in
his
throat
and
an
irritation
in
his
nose
and
the
tears
came
in
his
eyes
and
these
tears
touched
him
still
more
sobs
were
heard
in
the
room
the
countess
katerina
ivanovna
sat
with
her
elbows
on
an
inlaid
table
leaning
her
head
on
her
hands
and
her
shoulders
were
shaking
the
coachman
looked
with
fear
and
surprise
at
the
foreigner
feeling
as
if
he
was
about
to
run
him
down
with
the
pole
of
his
carriage
and
the
foreigner
would
not
move
out
of
his
way
all
sat
in
positions
similar
to
that
katerina
ivanovna
had
assumed
wolfs
daughter
a
thin
fashionablydressed
girl
very
like
her
father
knelt
with
her
face
in
her
hands
the
orator
suddenly
uncovered
his
face
and
smiled
a
very
reallooking
smile
such
as
actors
express
joy
with
and
began
again
with
a
sweet
gentle
voice
yet
there
is
a
way
to
be
saved
here
it
isa
joyful
easy
way
the
salvation
is
the
blood
shed
for
us
by
the
only
son
of
god
who
gave
himself
up
to
torments
for
our
sake
his
sufferings
his
blood
will
save
us
brothers
and
sisters
he
said
again
with
tears
in
his
voice
let
us
praise
the
lord
who
has
given
his
only
begotten
son
for
the
redemption
of
mankind
his
holy
blood



nekhludoff
felt
so
deeply
disgusted
that
he
rose
silently
and
frowning
and
keeping
back
a
groan
of
shame
he
left
on
tiptoe
and
went
to
his
room
chapter
xviii
officialdom
hardly
had
nekhludoff
finished
dressing
the
next
morning
just
as
he
was
about
to
go
down
the
footman
brought
him
a
card
from
the
moscow
advocate
the
advocate
had
come
to
st
petersburg
on
business
of
his
own
and
was
going
to
be
present
when
maslovas
case
was
examined
in
the
senate
if
that
would
be
soon
the
telegram
sent
by
nekhludoff
crossed
him
on
the
way
having
found
out
from
nekhludoff
when
the
case
was
going
to
be
heard
and
which
senators
were
to
be
present
he
smiled
exactly
all
the
three
types
of
senators
he
said
wolf
is
a
petersburg
official
skovorodnikoff
is
a
theoretical
and
bay
a
practical
lawyer
and
therefore
the
most
alive
of
them
all
said
the
advocate
there
is
most
hope
of
him
well
and
how
about
the
petition
committee
oh
im
going
to
baron
vorobioff
today
i
could
not
get
an
audience
with
him
yesterday
do
you
know
why
he
is
baron
vorobioff
said
the
advocate
noticing
the
slightly
ironical
stress
that
nekhludoff
put
on
this
foreign
title
followed
by
so
very
russian
a
surname
that
was
because
the
emperor
paul
rewarded
the
grandfatheri
think
he
was
one
of
the
court
footmenby
giving
him
this
title
he
managed
to
please
him
in
some
way
so
he
made
him
a
baron
its
my
wish
so
dont
gainsay
me
and
so
theres
a
baron
vorobioff
and
very
proud
of
the
title
he
is
a
dreadful
old
humbug
well
im
going
to
see
him
said
nekhludoff
thats
good
we
can
go
together
i
shall
give
you
a
lift
as
they
were
going
to
start
a
footman
met
nekhludoff
in
the
anteroom
and
handed
him
a
note
from

said
nekhludoff
to
the
advocate
is
this
not
dreadful
a
woman
whom
they
are
keeping
in
solitary
confinement
for
seven
months
turns
out
to
be
quite
innocent
and
only
a
word
was
needed
to
get
her
released
thats
always
so
well
anyhow
you
have
succeeded
in
getting
what
you
wanted
yes
but
this
success
grieves
me
just
think

must
be
going
on
there
why
have
they
been
keeping
her
oh
its
best
not
to
look
too
deeply
into
it
well
then
i
shall
give
you
a
lift
if
i
may
said
the
advocate
as
they
left
the
house
and
a
fine
carriage
that
the
advocate
had
hired
drove
up
to
the
door
its
baron
vorobioff
you
are
going
to
see
the
advocate
gave
the
driver
his
directions
and
the
two
good
horses
quickly
brought
nekhludoff
to
the
house
in
which
the
baron
lived
the
baron
was
at
home
a
young
official
in
uniform
with
a
long
thin
neck
a
much
protruding
adams
apple
and
an
extremely
light
walk
and
two
ladies
were
in
the
first
room
your
name
please
the
young
man
with
the
adams
apple
asked
stepping
with
extreme
lightness
and
grace
across
from
the
ladies
to
nekhludoff
nekhludoff
gave
his
name
the
baron
was
just
mentioning
you
said
the
young
man
the
barons
adjutant
and
went
out
through
an
inner
door
he
returned
leading
a
weeping
lady
dressed
in
mourning
with
her
bony
fingers
the
lady
was
trying
to
pull
her
tangled
veil
over
her
face
in
order
to
hide
her
tears
come
in
please
said
the
young
man
to
nekhludoff
lightly
stepping
up
to
the
door
of
the
study
and
holding
it
open
when
nekhludoff
came
in
he
saw
before
him
a
thickset
man
of
medium
height
with
short
hair
in
a
frock
coat
who
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
opposite
a
large
writingtable
and
looking
gaily
in
front
of
himself
the
kindly
rosy
red
face
striking
by
its
contrast
with
the
white
hair
moustaches
and
beard
turned
towards
nekhludoff
with
a
friendly
smile
very
glad
to
see
you
your
mother
and
i
were
old
acquaintances
and
friends
i
have
seen
you
as
a
boy
and
later
on
as
an
officer
sit
down
and
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
yes
yes
he
said
shaking
his
cropped
white
head
while
nekhludoff
was
telling
him
theodosias
story
go
on
go
on
i
quite
understand
it
is
certainly
very
touching
and
have
you
handed
in
the
petition
i
have
got
the
petition
ready
nekhludoff
said
getting
it
out
of
his
pocket
but
i
thought
of
speaking
to
you
first
in
hopes
that
the
case
would
then
get
special
attention
paid
to
it
you
have
done
very
well
i
shall
certainly
report
it
myself
said
the
baron
unsuccessfully
trying
to
put
an
expression
of
pity
on
his
merry
face
very
touching
it
is
clear
she
was
but
a
child
the
husband
treated
her
roughly
this
repelled
her
but
as
time
went
on
they
fell
in
love
with
each
other
yes
i
will
report
the
case
count
ivan
michaelovitch
was
also
going
to
speak
about
it
nekhludoff
had
hardly
got
these
words
out
when
the
barons
face
changed
you
had
better
hand
in
the
petition
into
the
office
after
all
and
i
shall
do
what
i
can
he
said
at
this
moment
the
young
official
again
entered
the
room
evidently
showing
off
his
elegant
manner
of
walking
that
lady
is
asking
if
she
may
say
a
few
words
more
well
ask
her
in
ah
mon
cher
how
many
tears
we
have
to
see
shed
if
only
we
could
dry
them
all
one
does
all
that
lies
within
ones
power
the
lady
entered
i
forgot
to
ask
you
that
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
give
up
the
daughter
because
he
is
ready



but
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
should
do
all
i
can
baron
for
the
love
of
god
you
will
save
the
mother
she
seized
his
hand
and
began
kissing
it
everything
shall
be
done
when
the
lady
went
out
nekhludoff
also
began
to
take
leave
we
shall
do
what
we
can
i
shall
speak
about
it
at
the
ministry
of
justice
and
when
we
get
their
answer
we
shall
do
what
we
can
nekhludoff
left
the
study
and
went
into
the
office
again
just
as
in
the
senate
office
he
saw
in
a
splendid
apartment
a
number
of
very
elegant
officials
clean
polite
severely
correct
and
distinguished
in
dress
and
in
speech
how
many
there
are
of
them
how
very
many
and
how
well
fed
they
all
look
and
what
clean
shirts
and
hands
they
all
have
and
how
well
all
their
boots
are
polished
who
does
it
for
them
how
comfortable
they
all
are
as
compared
not
only
with
the
prisoners
but
even
with
the
peasants
these
thoughts
again
involuntarily
came
to
nekhludoffs
mind
chapter
xix
an
old
general
of
repute
the
man
on
whom
depended
the
easing
of
the
fate
of
the
petersburg
prisoners
was
an
old
general
of
reputea
baron
of
german
descent
who
as
it
was
said
of
him
had
outlived
his
wits
he
had
received
a
profusion
of
orders
but
only
wore
one
of
them
the
order
of
the
white
cross
he
had
received
this
order
which
he
greatly
valued
while
serving
in
the
caucasus
because
a
number
of
russian
peasants
with
their
hair
cropped
and
dressed
in
uniform
and
armed
with
guns
and
bayonets
had
killed
at
his
command
more
than
a
thousand
men
who
were
defending
their
liberty
their
homes
and
their
families
later
on
he
served
in
poland
and
there
also
made
russian
peasants
commit
many
different
crimes
and
got
more
orders
and
decorations
for
his
uniform
then
he
served
somewhere
else
and
now
that
he
was
a
weak
old
man
he
had
this
position
which
insured
him
a
good
house
an
income
and
respect
he
strictly
observed
all
the
regulations
which
were
prescribed
from
above
and
was
very
zealous
in
the
fulfilment
of
these
regulations
to
which
he
ascribed
a
special
importance
considering
that
everything
else
in
the
world
might
be
changed
except
the
regulations
prescribed
from
above
his
duty
was
to
keep
political
prisoners
men
and
women
in
solitary
confinement
in
such
a
way
that
half
of
them
perished
in
10
years
time
some
going
out
of
their
minds
some
dying
of
consumption
some
committing
suicide
by
starving
themselves
to
death
cutting
their
veins
with
bits
of
glass
hanging
or
burning
themselves
to
death
the
old
general
was
not
ignorant
of
this
it
all
happened
within
his
knowledge
but
these
cases
no
more
touched
his
conscience
than
accidents
brought
on
by
thunderstorms
floods
etc
these
cases
occurred
as
a
consequence
of
the
fulfilment
of
regulations
prescribed
from
above
by
his
imperial
majesty
these
regulations
had
to
be
carried
out
without
fail
and
therefore
it
was
absolutely
useless
to
think
of
the
consequences
of
their
fulfilment
the
old
general
did
not
even
allow
himself
to
think
of
such
things
counting
it
his
patriotic
duty
as
a
soldier
not
to
think
of
them
for
fear
of
getting
weak
in
the
carrying
out
of
these
according
to
his
opinion
very
important
obligations
once
a
week
the
old
general
made
the
round
of
the
cells
one
of
the
duties
of
his
position
and
asked
the
prisoners
if
they
had
any
requests
to
make
the
prisoners
had
all
sorts
of
requests
he
listened
to
them
quietly
in
impenetrable
silence
and
never
fulfilled
any
of
their
requests
because
they
were
all
in
disaccord
with
the
regulations
just
as
nekhludoff
drove
up
to
the
old
generals
house
the
high
notes
of
the
bells
on
the
belfry
clock
chimed
great
is
the
lord
and
then
struck
two
the
sound
of
these
chimes
brought
back
to
nekhludoffs
mind
what
he
had
read
in
the
notes
of
the
decembrists
the
decembrists
were
a
group
who
attempted
but
failed
to
put
an
end
to
absolutism
in
russia
at
the
time
of
the
accession
of
nicholas
the
first
about
the
way
this
sweet
music
repeated
every
hour
reechoes
in
the
hearts
of
those
imprisoned
for
life
meanwhile
the
old
general
was
sitting
in
his
darkened
drawingroom
at
an
inlaid
table
turning
a
saucer
on
a
piece
of
paper
with
the
aid
of
a
young
artist
the
brother
of
one
of
his
subordinates
the
thin
weak
moist
fingers
of
the
artist
were
pressed
against
the
wrinkled
and
stiffjointed
fingers
of
the
old
general
and
the
hands
joined
in
this
manner
were
moving
together
with
the
saucer
over
a
paper
that
had
all
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
written
on
it
the
saucer
was
answering
the
questions
put
by
the
general
as
to
how
souls
will
recognise
each
other
after
death
when
nekhludoff
sent
in
his
card
by
an
orderly
acting
as
footman
the
soul
of
joan
of
arc
was
speaking
by
the
aid
of
the
saucer
the
soul
of
joan
of
arc
had
already
spelt
letter
by
letter
the
words
they
well
knew
each
other
and
these
words
had
been
written
down
when
the
orderly
came
in
the
saucer
had
stopped
first
on
b
then
on
y
and
began
jerking
hither
and
thither
this
jerking
was
caused
by
the
generals
opinion
that
the
next
letter
should
be
b
ie
joan
of
arc
ought
to
say
that
the
souls
will
know
each
other
by
being
cleansed
of
all
that
is
earthly
or
something
of
the
kind
clashing
with
the
opinion
of
the
artist
who
thought
the
next
letter
should
be
l
ie
that
the
souls
should
know
each
other
by
light
emanating
from
their
astral
bodies
the
general
with
his
bushy
grey
eyebrows
gravely
contracted
sat
gazing
at
the
hands
on
the
saucer
and
imagining
that
it
was
moving
of
its
own
accord
kept
pulling
the
saucer
towards
b
the
palefaced
young
artist
with
his
thin
hair
combed
back
behind
his
cars
was
looking
with
his
lifeless
blue
eyes
into
a
dark
corner
of
the
drawingroom
nervously
moving
his
lips
and
pulling
the
saucer
towards
l
the
general
made
a
wry
face
at
the
interruption
but
after
a
moments
pause
he
took
the
card
put
on
his
pincenez
and
uttering
a
groan
rose
in
spite
of
the
pain
in
his
back
to
his
full
height
rubbing
his
numb
fingers
ask
him
into
the
study
with
your
excellencys
permission
i
will
finish
it
alone
said
the
artist
rising
i
feel
the
presence
all
right
finish
alone
the
general
said
severely
and
decidedly
and
stepped
quickly
with
big
firm
and
measured
strides
into
his
study
very
pleased
to
see
you
said
the
general
to
nekhludoff
uttering
the
friendly
words
in
a
gruff
tone
and
pointing
to
an
armchair
by
the
side
of
the
writingtable
have
you
been
in
petersburg
long
nekhludoff
replied
that
he
had
only
lately
arrived
is
the
princess
your
mother
well
my
mother
is
dead
forgive
me
i
am
very
sorry
my
son
told
me
he
had
met
you
the
generals
son
was
making
the
same
kind
of
career
for
himself
that
the
father
had
done
and
having
passed
the
military
academy
was
now
serving
in
the
inquiry
office
and
was
very
proud
of
his
duties
there
his
occupation
was
the
management
of
government
spies
why
i
served
with
your
father
we
were
friendscomrades
and
you
are
you
also
in
the
service
no
i
am
not
the
general
bent
his
head
disapprovingly
i
have
a
request
to
make
general
very
pleased
in
what
way
can
i
be
of
service
to
you
if
my
request
is
out
of
place
pray
pardon
me
but
i
am
obliged
to
make
it
what
is
it
there
is
a
certain
gourkevitch
imprisoned
in
the
fortress
his
mother
asks
for
an
interview
with
him
or
at
least
to
be
allowed
to
send
him
some
books
the
general
expressed
neither
satisfaction
nor
dissatisfaction
at
nekhludoffs
request
but
bending
his
head
on
one
side
he
closed
his
eyes
as
if
considering
in
reality
he
was
not
considering
anything
and
was
not
even
interested
in
nekhludoffs
questions
well
knowing
that
he
would
answer
them
according
to
the
law
he
was
simply
resting
mentally
and
not
thinking
at
all
you
see
he
said
at
last
this
does
not
depend
on
me
there
is
a
regulation
confirmed
by
his
majesty
concerning
interviews
and
as
to
books
we
have
a
library
and
they
may
have
what
is
permitted
yes
but
he
wants
scientific
books
he
wishes
to
study
dont
you
believe
it
growled
the
general
its
not
study
he
wants
it
is
just
only
restlessness
but
what
is
to
be
done
they
must
occupy
their
time
somehow
in
their
hard
condition
said
nekhludoff
they
are
always
complaining
said
the
general
we
know
them
he
spoke
of
them
in
a
general
way
as
if
they
were
all
a
specially
bad
race
of
men
they
have
conveniences
here
which
can
be
found
in
few
places
of
confinement
said
the
general
and
he
began
to
enumerate
the
comforts
the
prisoners
enjoyed
as
if
the
aim
of
the
institution
was
to
give
the
people
imprisoned
there
a
comfortable
home
it
is
true
it
used
to
be
rather
rough
but
now
they
are
very
well
kept
here
he
continued
they
have
three
courses
for
dinnerand
one
of
them
meatcutlets
or
rissoles
and
on
sundays
they
get
a
fourtha
sweet
dish
god
grant
every
russian
may
eat
as
well
as
they
do
like
all
old
people
the
general
having
once
got
on
to
a
familiar
topic
enumerated
the
various
proofs
he
had
often
given
before
of
the
prisoners
being
exacting
and
ungrateful
they
get
books
on
spiritual
subjects
and
old
journals
we
have
a
library
only
they
rarely
read
at
first
they
seem
interested
later
on
the
new
books
remain
uncut
and
the
old
ones
with
their
leaves
unturned
we
tried
them
said
the
old
general
with
the
dim
likeness
of
a
smile
we
put
bits
of
paper
in
on
purpose
which
remained
just
as
they
had
been
placed
writing
is
also
not
forbidden
he
continued
a
slate
is
provided
and
a
slate
pencil
so
that
they
can
write
as
a
pastime
they
can
wipe
the
slate
and
write
again
but
they
dont
write
either
oh
they
very
soon
get
quite
tranquil
at
first
they
seem
restless
but
later
on
they
even
grow
fat
and
become
very
quiet
thus
spoke
the
general
never
suspecting
the
terrible
meaning
of
his
words
nekhludoff
listened
to
the
hoarse
old
voice
looked
at
the
stiff
limbs
the
swollen
eyelids
under
the
grey
brows
at
the
old
cleanshaved
flabby
jaw
supported
by
the
collar
of
the
military
uniform
at
the
white
cross
that
this
man
was
so
proud
of
chiefly
because
he
had
gained
it
by
exceptionally
cruel
and
extensive
slaughter
and
knew
that
it
was
useless
to
reply
to
the
old
man
or
to
explain
the
meaning
of
his
own
words
to
him
he
made
another
effort
and
asked
about
the
prisoner
shoustova
for
whose
release
as
he
had
been
informed
that
morning
orders
were
given
shoustovashoustova
i
cannot
remember
all
their
names
there
are
so
many
of
them
he
said
as
if
reproaching
them
because
there
were
so
many
he
rang
and
ordered
the
secretary
to
be
called
while
waiting
for
the
latter
he
began
persuading
nekhludoff
to
serve
saying
that
honest
noblemen
counting
himself
among
the
number
were
particularly
needed
by
the
tsar
andthe
country
he
added
evidently
only
to
round
off
his
sentence
i
am
old
yet
i
am
serving
still
as
well
as
my
strength
allows
the
secretary
a
dry
emaciated
man
with
restless
intelligent
eyes
came
in
and
reported
that
shoustova
was
imprisoned
in
some
queer
fortified
place
and
that
he
had
received
no
orders
concerning
her
when
we
get
the
order
we
shall
let
her
out
the
same
day
we
do
not
keep
them
we
do
not
value
their
visits
much
said
the
general
with
another
attempt
at
a
playful
smile
which
only
distorted
his
old
face
nekhludoff
rose
trying
to
keep
from
expressing
the
mixed
feelings
of
repugnance
and
pity
which
he
felt
towards
this
terrible
old
man
the
old
man
on
his
part
considered
that
he
should
not
be
too
severe
on
the
thoughtless
and
evidently
misguided
son
of
his
old
comrade
and
should
not
leave
him
without
advice
goodbye
my
dear
fellow
do
not
take
it
amiss
it
is
my
affection
that
makes
me
say
it
do
not
keep
company
with
such
people
as
we
have
at
our
place
here
there
are
no
innocent
ones
among
them
all
these
people
are
most
immoral
we
know
them
he
said
in
a
tone
that
admitted
no
possibility
of
doubt
and
he
did
not
doubt
not
because
the
thing
was
so
but
because
if
it
was
not
so
he
would
have
to
admit
himself
to
be
not
a
noble
hero
living
out
the
last
days
of
a
good
life
but
a
scoundrel
who
sold
and
still
continued
in
his
old
age
to
sell
his
conscience
best
of
all
go
and
serve
he
continued
the
tsar
needs
honest
menand
the
country
he
added
well
supposing
i
and
the
others
refused
to
serve
as
you
are
doing
who
would
be
left
here
we
are
finding
fault
with
the
order
of
things
and
yet
not
wishing
to
help
the
government
with
a
deep
sigh
nekhludoff
made
a
low
bow
shook
the
large
bony
hand
condescendingly
stretched
out
to
him
and
left
the
room
the
general
shook
his
head
reprovingly
and
rubbing
his
back
he
again
went
into
the
drawingroom
where
the
artist
was
waiting
for
him
he
had
already
written
down
the
answer
given
by
the
soul
of
joan
of
arc
the
general
put
on
his
pincenez
and
read
will
know
one
another
by
light
emanating
from
their
astral
bodies
ah
said
the
general
with
approval
and
closed
his
eyes
but
how
is
one
to
know
if
the
light
of
all
is
alike
he
asked
and
again
crossed
fingers
with
the
artist
on
the
saucer
the
isvostchik
drove
nekhludoff
out
of
the
gate
it
is
dull
here
sir
he
said
turning
to
nekhludoff
i
almost
wished
to
drive
off
without
waiting
for
you
nekhludoff
agreed
yes
it
is
dull
and
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
looked
up
with
a
sense
of
relief
at
the
grey
clouds
that
were
floating
in
the
sky
and
at
the
glistening
ripples
made
by
the
boats
and
steamers
on
the
neva
chapter
xx
maslovas
appeal
the
next
day
maslovas
case
was
to
be
examined
at
the
senate
and
nekhludoff
and
the
advocate
met
at
the
majestic
portal
of
the
building
where
several
carriages
were
waiting
ascending
the
magnificent
and
imposing
staircase
to
the
first
floor
the
advocate
who
knew
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
place
turned
to
the
left
and
entered
through
a
door
which
had
the
date
of
the
introduction
of
the
code
of
laws
above
it
after
taking
off
his
overcoat
in
the
first
narrow
room
he
found
out
from
the
attendant
that
the
senators
had
all
arrived
and
that
the
last
had
just
come
in
fanarin
in
his
swallowtail
coat
a
white
tie
above
the
white
shirtfront
and
a
selfconfident
smile
on
his
lips
passed
into
the
next
room
in
this
room
there
were
to
the
right
a
large
cupboard
and
a
table
and
to
the
left
a
winding
staircase
which
an
elegant
official
in
uniform
was
descending
with
a
portfolio
under
his
arm
in
this
room
an
old
man
with
long
white
hair
and
a
patriarchal
appearance
attracted
every
ones
attention
he
wore
a
short
coat
and
grey
trousers
two
attendants
stood
respectfully
beside
him
the
old
man
with
white
hair
entered
the
cupboard
and
shut
himself
in
fanarin
noticed
a
fellowadvocate
dressed
in
the
same
way
as
himself
with
a
white
tie
and
dress
coat
and
at
once
entered
into
an
animated
conversation
with
him
nekhludoff
was
meanwhile
examining
the
people
in
the
room
the
public
consisted
of
about
15
persons
of
whom
two
were
ladiesa
young
one
with
a
pincenez
and
an
old
greyhaired
one
a
case
of
libel
was
to
be
heard
that
day
and
therefore
the
public
were
more
numerous
than
usualchiefly
persons
belonging
to
the
journalistic
world
the
usher
a
redcheeked
handsome
man
in
a
fine
uniform
came
up
to
fanarin
and
asked
him
what
his
business
was
when
he
heard
that
it
was
the
case
of
maslova
he
noted
something
down
and
walked
away
then
the
cupboard
door
opened
and
the
old
man
with
the
patriarchal
appearance
stepped
out
no
longer
in
a
short
coat
but
in
a
goldtrimmed
attire
which
made
him
look
like
a
bird
and
with
metal
plates
on
his
breast
this
funny
costume
seemed
to
make
the
old
man
himself
feel
uncomfortable
and
walking
faster
than
his
wont
he
hurried
out
of
the
door
opposite
the
entrance
that
is
bay
a
most
estimable
man
fanarin
said
to
nekhludoff
and
then
having
introduced
him
to
his
colleague
he
explained
the
case
that
was
about
to
be
heard
which
he
considered
very
interesting
the
hearing
of
the
case
soon
commenced
and
nekhludoff
with
the
public
entered
the
left
side
of
the
senate
chamber
they
all
including
fanarin
took
their
places
behind
a
grating
only
the
petersburg
advocate
went
up
to
a
desk
in
front
of
the
grating
the
senate
chamber
was
not
so
big
as
the
criminal
court
and
was
more
simply
furnished
only
the
table
in
front
of
the
senators
was
covered
with
crimson
goldtrimmed
velvet
instead
of
green
cloth
but
the
attributes
of
all
places
of
judgment
ie
the
mirror
of
justice
the
icon
the
emblem
of
hypocrisy
and
the
emperors
portrait
the
emblem
of
servility
were
there
the
usher
announced
in
the
same
solemn
manner
the
court
is
coming
every
one
rose
in
the
same
way
and
the
senators
entered
in
their
uniforms
and
sat
down
on
highbacked
chairs
and
leant
on
the
table
trying
to
appear
natural
just
in
the
same
way
as
the
judges
in
the
court
of
law
there
were
four
senators
presentnikitin
who
took
the
chair
a
cleanshaved
man
with
a
narrow
face
and
steely
eyes
wolf
with
significantly
compressed
lips
and
little
white
hands
with
which
he
kept
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
business
papers
skovorodnikoff
a
heavy
fat
pockmarked
manthe
learned
lawyer
and
bay
the
patriarchallooking
man
who
had
arrived
last
with
the
advocates
entered
the
chief
secretary
and
public
prosecutor
a
lean
cleanshaven
young
man
of
medium
height
a
very
dark
complexion
and
sad
black
eyes
nekhludoff
knew
him
at
once
in
spite
of
his
curious
uniform
and
the
fact
that
he
had
not
seen
him
for
six
years
he
had
been
one
of
his
best
friends
in
nekhludoffs
student
days
the
public
prosecutor
selenin
nekhludoff
asked
turning
to
the
advocate
yes
why
i
know
him
well
he
is
a
fine
fellow
and
a
good
public
prosecutor
businesslike
now
he
is
the
man
you
should
have
interested
he
will
act
according
to
his
conscience
in
any
case
said
nekhludoff
recalling
the
intimate
relations
and
friendship
between
himself
and
selenin
and
the
attractive
qualities
of
the
latterpurity
honesty
and
good
breeding
in
its
best
sense
yes
there
is
no
time
now
whispered
fanarin
who
was
listening
to
the
report
of
the
case
that
had
commenced
the
court
of
justice
was
accused
of
having
left
a
decision
of
the
court
of
law
unaltered
nekhludoff
listened
and
tried
to
make
out
the
meaning
of
what
was
going
on
but
just
as
in
the
criminal
court
his
chief
difficulty
was
that
not
the
evidently
chief
point
but
some
side
issues
were
being
discussed
the
case
was
that
of
a
newspaper
which
had
published
the
account
of
a
swindle
arranged
by
a
director
of
a
limited
liability
company
it
seemed
that
the
only
important
question
was
whether
the
director
of
the
company
really
abused
his
trust
and
how
to
stop
him
from
doing
it
but
the
questions
under
consideration
were
whether
the
editor
had
a
right
to
publish
this
article
of
his
contributor
and
what
he
had
been
guilty
of
in
publishing
it
slander
or
libel
and
in
what
way
slander
included
libel
or
libel
included
slander
and
something
rather
incomprehensible
to
ordinary
people
about
all
sorts
of
statutes
and
resolutions
passed
by
some
general
department
the
only
thing
clear
to
nekhludoff
was
that
in
spite
of
what
wolf
had
so
strenuously
insisted
on
the
day
before
ie
that
the
senate
could
not
try
a
case
on
its
merits
in
this
case
he
was
evidently
strongly
in
favour
of
repealing
the
decision
of
the
court
of
justice
and
that
selenin
in
spite
of
his
characteristic
reticence
stated
the
opposite
opinion
with
quite
unexpected
warmth
the
warmth
which
surprised
nekhludoff
evinced
by
the
usually
selfcontrolled
selenin
was
due
to
his
knowledge
of
the
directors
shabbiness
in
money
matters
and
the
fact
which
had
accidentally
come
to
his
cars
that
wolf
had
been
to
a
swell
dinner
party
at
the
swindlers
house
only
a
few
days
before
now
that
wolf
spoke
on
the
case
guardedly
enough
but
with
evident
bias
selenin
became
excited
and
expressed
his
opinion
with
too
much
nervous
irritation
for
an
ordinary
business
transaction
it
was
clear
that
selenins
speech
had
offended
wolf
he
grew
red
moved
in
his
chair
made
silent
gestures
of
surprise
and
at
last
rose
with
a
very
dignified
and
injured
look
together
with
the
other
senators
and
went
out
into
the
debatingroom
what
particular
case
have
you
come
about
the
usher
asked
again
addressing
fanarin
i
have
already
told
you
maslovas
case
yes
quite
so
it
is
to
be
heard
today
but
but
what
the
advocate
asked
well
you
see
this
case
was
to
be
examined
without
taking
sides
so
that
the
senators
will
hardly
come
out
again
after
passing
the
resolution
but
i
will
inform
them
what
do
you
mean
ill
inform
them
ill
inform
them
and
the
usher
again
put
something
down
on
his
paper
the
senators
really
meant
to
pronounce
their
decision
concerning
the
libel
case
and
then
to
finish
the
other
business
maslovas
case
among
it
over
their
tea
and
cigarettes
without
leaving
the
debatingroom
chapter
xxi
the
appeal
dismissed
as
soon
as
the
senators
were
seated
round
the
table
in
the
debatingroom
wolf
began
to
bring
forward
with
great
animation
all
the
motives
in
favour
of
a
repeal
the
chairman
an
illnatured
man
at
best
was
in
a
particularly
bad
humour
that
day
his
thoughts
were
concentrated
on
the
words
he
had
written
down
in
his
memoranda
on
the
occasion
when
not
he
but
viglanoff
was
appointed
to
the
important
post
he
had
long
coveted
it
was
the
chairman
nikitins
honest
conviction
that
his
opinions
of
the
officials
of
the
two
upper
classes
with
which
he
was
in
connection
would
furnish
valuable
material
for
the
historians
he
had
written
a
chapter
the
day
before
in
which
the
officials
of
the
upper
classes
got
it
hot
for
preventing
him
as
he
expressed
it
from
averting
the
ruin
towards
which
the
present
rulers
of
russia
were
driving
it
which
simply
meant
that
they
had
prevented
his
getting
a
better
salary
and
now
he
was
considering
what
a
new
light
to
posterity
this
chapter
would
shed
on
events
yes
certainly
he
said
in
reply
to
the
words
addressed
to
him
by
wolf
without
listening
to
them
bay
was
listening
to
wolf
with
a
sad
face
and
drawing
a
garland
on
the
paper
that
lay
before
him
bay
was
a
liberal
of
the
very
first
water
he
held
sacred
the
liberal
traditions
of
the
sixth
decade
of
this
century
and
if
he
ever
overstepped
the
limits
of
strict
neutrality
it
was
always
in
the
direction
of
liberalism
so
in
this
case
beside
the
fact
that
the
swindling
director
who
was
prosecuting
for
libel
was
a
bad
lot
the
prosecution
of
a
journalist
for
libel
in
itself
tending
as
it
did
to
restrict
the
freedom
of
the
press
inclined
bay
to
reject
the
appeal
when
wolf
concluded
his
arguments
bay
stopped
drawing
his
garland
and
began
in
a
sad
and
gentle
voice
he
was
sad
because
he
was
obliged
to
demonstrate
such
truisms
concisely
simply
and
convincingly
to
show
how
unfounded
the
accusation
was
and
then
bending
his
white
head
he
continued
drawing
his
garland
skovorodnikoff
who
sat
opposite
wolf
and
with
his
fat
fingers
kept
shoving
his
beard
and
moustaches
into
his
mouth
stopped
chewing
his
beard
as
soon
as
bay
was
silent
and
said
with
a
loud
grating
voice
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
of
the
director
being
a
terrible
scoundrel
he
would
have
been
for
the
repeal
of
the
sentence
if
there
were
any
legal
reasons
for
it
but
as
there
were
none
he
was
of
bays
opinion
he
was
glad
to
put
this
spoke
in
wolfs
wheel
the
chairman
agreed
with
skovorodnikoff
and
the
appeal
was
rejected
wolf
was
dissatisfied
especially
because
it
was
like
being
caught
acting
with
dishonest
partiality
so
he
pretended
to
be
indifferent
and
unfolding
the
document
which
contained
maslovas
case
he
became
engrossed
in
it
meanwhile
the
senators
rang
and
ordered
tea
and
began
talking
about
the
event
that
together
with
the
duel
was
occupying
the
petersburgers
it
was
the
case
of
the
chief
of
a
government
department
who
was
accused
of
the
crime
provided
for
in
statute
995
what
nastiness
said
bay
with
disgust
why
where
is
the
harm
of
it
i
can
show
you
a
russian
book
containing
the
project
of
a
german
writer
who
openly
proposes
that
it
should
not
be
considered
a
crime
said
skovorodnikoff
drawing
in
greedily
the
fumes
of
the
crumpled
cigarette
which
he
held
between
his
fingers
close
to
the
palm
and
he
laughed
boisterously
impossible
said
bay
i
shall
show
it
you
said
skovorodnikoff
giving
the
full
title
of
the
book
and
even
its
date
and
the
name
of
its
editor
i
hear
he
has
been
appointed
governor
to
some
town
in
siberia
thats
fine
the
archdeacon
will
meet
him
with
a
crucifix
they
ought
to
appoint
an
archdeacon
of
the
same
sort
said
skovorodnikoff
i
could
recommend
them
one
and
he
threw
the
end
of
his
cigarette
into
his
saucer
and
again
shoved
as
much
of
his
beard
and
moustaches
as
he
could
into
his
mouth
and
began
chewing
them
the
usher
came
in
and
reported
the
advocates
and
nekhludoffs
desire
to
be
present
at
the
examination
of
maslovas
case
this
case
wolf
said
is
quite
romantic
and
he
told
them
what
he
knew
about
nekhludoffs
relations
with
maslova
when
they
had
spoken
a
little
about
it
and
finished
their
tea
and
cigarettes
the
senators
returned
into
the
senate
chamber
and
proclaimed
their
decision
in
the
libel
case
and
began
to
hear
maslovas
case
wolf
in
his
thin
voice
reported
maslovas
appeal
very
fully
but
again
not
without
some
bias
and
an
evident
wish
for
the
repeal
of
the
sentence
have
you
anything
to
add
the
chairman
said
turning
to
fanarin
fanarin
rose
and
standing
with
his
broad
white
chest
expanded
proved
point
by
point
with
wonderful
exactness
and
persuasiveness
how
the
court
had
in
six
points
strayed
from
the
exact
meaning
of
the
law
and
besides
this
he
touched
though
briefly
on
the
merits
of
the
case
and
on
the
crying
injustice
of
the
sentence
the
tone
of
his
speech
was
one
of
apology
to
the
senators
who
with
their
penetration
and
judicial
wisdom
could
not
help
seeing
and
understanding
it
all
better
than
he
could
he
was
obliged
to
speak
only
because
the
duty
he
had
undertaken
forced
him
to
do
so
after
fanarins
speech
one
might
have
thought
that
there
could
not
remain
the
least
doubt
that
the
senate
ought
to
repeal
the
decision
of
the
court
when
he
had
finished
his
speech
fanarin
looked
round
with
a
smile
of
triumph
seeing
which
nekhludoff
felt
certain
that
the
case
was
won
but
when
he
looked
at
the
senators
he
saw
that
fanarin
smiled
and
triumphed
all
alone
the
senators
and
the
public
prosecutor
did
not
smile
nor
triumph
but
looked
like
people
wearied
and
who
were
thinking
we
have
often
heard
the
like
of
you
it
is
all
in
vain
and
were
only
too
glad
when
he
stopped
and
ceased
uselessly
detaining
them
there
immediately
after
the
end
of
the
advocates
speech
the
chairman
turned
to
the
public
prosecutor
selenin
briefly
and
clearly
expressed
himself
in
favour
of
leaving
the
decision
of
the
court
unaltered
as
he
considered
all
the
reasons
for
appealing
inadequate
after
this
the
senators
went
out
into
the
debatingroom
they
were
divided
in
their
opinions
wolf
was
in
favour
of
altering
the
decision
bay
when
he
had
understood
the
case
took
up
the
same
side
with
fervour
vividly
presenting
the
scene
at
the
court
to
his
companions
as
he
clearly
saw
it
himself
nikitin
who
always
was
on
the
side
of
severity
and
formality
took
up
the
other
side
all
depended
on
skovorodnikoffs
vote
and
he
voted
for
rejecting
the
appeal
because
nekhludoffs
determination
to
marry
the
woman
on
moral
grounds
was
extremely
repugnant
to
him
skovorodnikoff
was
a
materialist
a
darwinian
and
counted
every
manifestation
of
abstract
morality
or
worse
still
religion
not
only
as
a
despicable
folly
but
as
a
personal
affront
to
himself
all
this
bother
about
a
prostitute
and
the
presence
of
a
celebrated
advocate
and
nekhludoff
in
the
senate
were
in
the
highest
degree
repugnant
to
him
so
he
shoved
his
beard
into
his
mouth
and
made
faces
and
very
skilfully
pretended
to
know
nothing
of
this
case
excepting
that
the
reasons
for
an
appeal
were
insufficient
and
that
he
therefore
agreed
with
the
chairman
to
leave
the
decision
of
the
court
unaltered
so
the
sentence
remained
unrepealed
chapter
xxii
an
old
friend
terrible
said
nekhludoff
as
he
went
out
into
the
waitingroom
with
the
advocate
who
was
arranging
the
papers
in
his
portfolio
in
a
matter
which
is
perfectly
clear
they
attach
all
the
importance
to
the
form
and
reject
the
appeal
terrible
the
case
was
spoiled
in
the
criminal
court
said
the
advocate
and
selenin
too
was
in
favour
of
the
rejection
terrible
terrible
nekhludoff
repeated
what
is
to
be
done
now
we
will
appeal
to
his
majesty
and
you
can
hand
in
the
petition
yourself
while
you
are
here
i
will
write
it
for
you
at
this
moment
little
wolf
with
his
stars
and
uniform
came
out
into
the
waitingroom
and
approached
nekhludoff
it
could
not
be
helped
dear
prince
the
reasons
for
an
appeal
were
not
sufficient
he
said
shrugging
his
narrow
shoulders
and
closing
his
eyes
and
then
he
went
his
way
after
wolf
selenin
came
out
too
having
heard
from
the
senators
that
his
old
friend
nekhludoff
was
there
well
i
never
expected
to
see
you
here
he
said
coming
up
to
nekhludoff
and
smiling
only
with
his
lips
while
his
eyes
remained
sad
i
did
not
know
you
were
in
petersburg
and
i
did
not
know
you
were
public
prosecutorinchief
how
is
it
you
are
in
the
senate
asked
selenin
i
had
heard
by
the
way
that
you
were
in
petersburg
but
what
are
you
doing
here
here
i
am
here
because
i
hoped
to
find
justice
and
save
a
woman
innocently
condemned
what
woman
the
one
whose
case
has
just
been
decided
oh
maslovas
case
said
selenin
suddenly
remembering
it
the
appeal
had
no
grounds
whatever
it
is
not
the
appeal
its
the
woman
who
is
innocent
and
is
being
punished
selenin
sighed
that
may
well
be
but
not
may
be
but
is
how
do
you
know
because
i
was
on
the
jury
i
know
how
we
made
the
mistake
selenin
became
thoughtful
you
should
have
made
a
statement
at
the
time
he
said
i
did
make
the
statement
it
should
have
been
put
down
in
an
official
report
if
this
had
been
added
to
the
petition
for
the
appeal
yes
but
still
as
it
is
the
verdict
is
evidently
absurd
the
senate
has
no
right
to
say
so
if
the
senate
took
upon
itself
to
repeal
the
decision
of
the
law
courts
according
to
its
own
views
as
to
the
justice
of
the
decisions
in
themselves
the
verdict
of
the
jury
would
lose
all
its
meaning
not
to
mention
that
the
senate
would
have
no
basis
to
go
upon
and
would
run
the
risk
of
infringing
justice
rather
than
upholding
it
said
selenin
calling
to
mind
the
case
that
had
just
been
heard
all
i
know
is
that
this
woman
is
quite
innocent
and
that
the
last
hope
of
saving
her
from
an
unmerited
punishment
is
gone
the
grossest
injustice
has
been
confirmed
by
the
highest
court
it
has
not
been
confirmed
the
senate
did
not
and
cannot
enter
into
the
merits
of
the
case
in
itself
said
selenin
always
busy
and
rarely
going
out
into
society
he
had
evidently
heard
nothing
of
nekhludoffs
romance
nekhludoff
noticed
it
and
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
best
to
say
nothing
about
his
special
relations
with
maslova
you
are
probably
staying
with
your
aunt
selenin
remarked
apparently
wishing
to
change
the
subject
she
told
me
you
were
here
yesterday
and
she
invited
me
to
meet
you
in
the
evening
when
some
foreign
preacher
was
to
lecture
and
selenin
again
smiled
only
with
his
lips
yes
i
was
there
but
left
in
disgust
said
nekhludoff
angrily
vexed
that
selenin
had
changed
the
subject
why
with
disgust
after
all
it
is
a
manifestation
of
religious
feeling
though
onesided
and
sectarian
said
selenin
why
its
only
some
kind
of
whimsical
folly
oh
dear
no
the
curious
thing
is
that
we
know
the
teaching
of
our
church
so
little
that
we
see
some
new
kind
of
revelation
in
what
are
after
all
our
own
fundamental
dogmas
said
selenin
as
if
hurrying
to
let
his
old
friend
know
his
new
views
nekhludoff
looked
at
selenin
scrutinisingly
and
with
surprise
and
selenin
dropped
his
eyes
in
which
appeared
an
expression
not
only
of
sadness
but
also
of
illwill
do
you
then
believe
in
the
dogmas
of
the
church
nekhludoff
asked
of
course
i
do
replied
selenin
gazing
straight
into
nekhludoffs
eyes
with
a
lifeless
look
nekhludoff
sighed
it
is
strange
he
said
however
we
shall
have
a
talk
some
other
time
said
selenin
i
am
coming
he
added
in
answer
to
the
usher
who
had
respectfully
approached
him
yes
we
must
meet
again
he
went
on
with
a
sigh
but
will
it
be
possible
for
me
to
find
you
you
will
always
find
me
in
at
seven
oclock
my
address
is
nadejdinskaya
and
he
gave
the
number
ah
time
does
not
stand
still
and
he
turned
to
go
smiling
only
with
his
lips
i
will
come
if
i
can
said
nekhludoff
feeling
that
a
man
once
near
and
dear
to
him
had
by
this
brief
conversation
suddenly
become
strange
distant
and
incomprehensible
if
not
hostile
to
him
chapter
xxiii
the
public
prosecutor
when
nekhludoff
knew
selenin
as
a
student
he
was
a
good
son
a
true
friend
and
for
his
years
an
educated
man
of
the
world
with
much
tact
elegant
handsome
and
at
the
same
time
truthful
and
honest
he
learned
well
without
much
exertion
and
with
no
pedantry
receiving
gold
medals
for
his
essays
he
considered
the
service
of
mankind
not
only
in
words
but
in
acts
to
be
the
aim
of
his
young
life
he
saw
no
other
way
of
being
useful
to
humanity
than
by
serving
the
state
therefore
as
soon
as
he
had
completed
his
studies
he
systematically
examined
all
the
activities
to
which
he
might
devote
his
life
and
decided
to
enter
the
second
department
of
the
chancellerie
where
the
laws
are
drawn
up
and
he
did
so
but
in
spite
of
the
most
scrupulous
and
exact
discharge
of
the
duties
demanded
of
him
this
service
gave
no
satisfaction
to
his
desire
of
being
useful
nor
could
he
awake
in
himself
the
consciousness
that
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
this
dissatisfaction
was
so
much
increased
by
the
friction
with
his
very
smallminded
and
vain
fellow
officials
that
he
left
the
chancellerie
and
entered
the
senate
it
was
better
there
but
the
same
dissatisfaction
still
pursued
him
he
felt
it
to
be
very
different
from
what
he
had
expected
and
from
what
ought
to
be
and
now
that
he
was
in
the
senate
his
relatives
obtained
for
him
the
post
of
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
and
he
had
to
go
in
a
carriage
dressed
in
an
embroidered
uniform
and
a
white
linen
apron
to
thank
all
sorts
of
people
for
having
placed
him
in
the
position
of
a
lackey
however
much
he
tried
he
could
find
no
reasonable
explanation
for
the
existence
of
this
post
and
felt
more
than
in
the
senate
that
it
was
not
the
right
thing
and
yet
he
could
not
refuse
it
for
fear
of
hurting
those
who
felt
sure
they
were
giving
him
much
pleasure
by
this
appointment
and
because
it
flattered
the
lowest
part
of
his
nature
it
pleased
him
to
see
himself
in
a
mirror
in
his
goldembroidered
uniform
and
to
accept
the
deference
paid
him
by
some
people
because
of
his
position
something
of
the
same
kind
happened
when
he
married
a
very
brilliant
match
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
was
arranged
for
him
and
he
married
chiefly
because
by
refusing
he
would
have
had
to
hurt
the
young
lady
who
wished
to
be
married
to
him
and
those
who
arranged
the
marriage
and
also
because
a
marriage
with
a
nice
young
girl
of
noble
birth
flattered
his
vanity
and
gave
him
pleasure
but
this
marriage
very
soon
proved
to
be
even
less
the
right
thing
than
the
government
service
and
his
position
at
court
after
the
birth
of
her
first
child
the
wife
decided
to
have
no
more
and
began
leading
that
luxurious
worldly
life
in
which
he
now
had
to
participate
whether
he
liked
or
not
she
was
not
particularly
handsome
and
was
faithful
to
him
and
she
seemed
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
it
cost
her
to
derive
nothing
but
weariness
from
the
life
she
led
yet
she
perseveringly
continued
to
live
it
though
it
was
poisoning
her
husbands
life
and
all
his
efforts
to
alter
this
life
was
shattered
as
against
a
stone
wall
by
her
conviction
which
all
her
friends
and
relatives
supported
that
all
was
as
it
should
be
the
child
a
little
girl
with
bare
legs
and
long
golden
curls
was
a
being
perfectly
foreign
to
him
chiefly
because
she
was
trained
quite
otherwise
than
he
wished
her
to
be
there
sprung
up
between
the
husband
and
wife
the
usual
misunderstanding
without
even
the
wish
to
understand
each
other
and
then
a
silent
warfare
hidden
from
outsiders
and
tempered
by
decorum
all
this
made
his
life
at
home
a
burden
and
became
even
less
the
right
thing
than
his
service
and
his
post
but
it
was
above
all
his
attitude
towards
religion
which
was
not
the
right
thing
like
every
one
of
his
set
and
his
time
by
the
growth
of
his
reason
he
broke
without
the
least
effort
the
nets
of
the
religious
superstitions
in
which
he
was
brought
up
and
did
not
himself
exactly
know
when
it
was
that
he
freed
himself
of
them
being
earnest
and
upright
he
did
not
during
his
youth
and
intimacy
with
nekhludoff
as
a
student
conceal
his
rejection
of
the
state
religion
but
as
years
went
on
and
he
rose
in
the
service
and
especially
at
the
time
of
the
reaction
towards
conservatism
in
society
his
spiritual
freedom
stood
in
his
way
at
home
when
his
father
died
he
had
to
be
present
at
the
masses
said
for
his
soul
and
his
mother
wished
him
to
go
to
confession
or
to
communion
and
it
was
in
a
way
expected
by
public
opinion
but
above
all
government
service
demanded
that
he
should
be
present
at
all
sorts
of
services
consecrations
thanksgivings
and
the
like
hardly
a
day
passed
without
some
outward
religious
form
having
to
be
observed
when
present
at
these
services
he
had
to
pretend
that
he
believed
in
something
which
he
did
not
believe
in
and
being
truthful
he
could
not
do
this
the
alternative
was
having
made
up
his
mind
that
all
these
outward
signs
were
deceitful
to
alter
his
life
in
such
a
way
that
he
would
not
have
to
be
present
at
such
ceremonials
but
to
do
what
seemed
so
simple
would
have
cost
a
great
deal
besides
encountering
the
perpetual
hostility
of
all
those
who
were
near
to
him
he
would
have
to
give
up
the
service
and
his
position
and
sacrifice
his
hopes
of
being
useful
to
humanity
by
his
service
now
and
in
the
future
to
make
such
a
sacrifice
one
would
have
to
be
firmly
convinced
of
being
right
and
he
was
firmly
convinced
he
was
right
as
no
educated
man
of
our
time
can
help
being
convinced
who
knows
a
little
history
and
how
the
religions
and
especially
church
christianity
originated
but
under
the
stress
of
his
daily
life
he
a
truthful
man
allowed
a
little
falsehood
to
creep
in
he
said
that
in
order
to
do
justice
to
an
unreasonable
thing
one
had
to
study
the
unreasonable
thing
it
was
a
little
falsehood
but
it
sunk
him
into
the
big
falsehood
in
which
he
was
now
caught
before
putting
to
himself
the
question
whether
the
orthodoxy
in
which
he
was
born
and
bred
and
which
every
one
expected
him
to
accept
and
without
which
he
could
not
continue
his
useful
occupation
contained
the
truth
he
had
already
decided
the
answer
and
to
clear
up
the
question
he
did
not
read
voltaire
schopenhauer
herbert
spencer
or
comte
but
the
philosophical
works
of
hegel
and
the
religious
works
of
vinet
and
khomyakoff
and
naturally
found
in
them
what
he
wanted
ie
something
like
peace
of
mind
and
a
vindication
of
that
religious
teaching
in
which
he
was
educated
which
his
reason
had
long
ceased
to
accept
but
without
which
his
whole
life
was
filled
with
unpleasantness
which
could
all
be
removed
by
accepting
the
teaching
and
so
he
adopted
all
the
usual
sophistries
which
go
to
prove
that
a
single
human
reason
cannot
know
the
truth
that
the
truth
is
only
revealed
to
an
association
of
men
and
can
only
be
known
by
revelation
that
revelation
is
kept
by
the
church
etc
and
so
he
managed
to
be
present
at
prayers
masses
for
the
dead
to
confess
make
signs
of
the
cross
in
front
of
icons
with
a
quiet
mind
without
being
conscious
of
the
lie
and
to
continue
in
the
service
which
gave
him
the
feeling
of
being
useful
and
some
comfort
in
his
joyless
family
life
although
he
believed
this
he
felt
with
his
entire
being
that
this
religion
of
his
more
than
all
else
was
not
the
right
thing
and
that
is
why
his
eyes
always
looked
sad
and
seeing
nekhludoff
whom
he
had
known
before
all
these
lies
had
rooted
themselves
within
him
reminded
him
of
what
he
then
was
it
was
especially
after
he
had
hurried
to
hint
at
his
religious
views
that
he
had
most
strongly
felt
all
this
not
the
right
thing
and
had
become
painfully
sad
nekhludoff
felt
it
also
after
the
first
joy
of
meeting
his
old
friend
had
passed
and
therefore
though
they
promised
each
other
to
meet
they
did
not
take
any
steps
towards
an
interview
and
did
not
again
see
each
other
during
this
stay
of
nekhludoffs
in
petersburg
chapter
xxiv
mariette
tempts
nekhludoff
when
they
left
the
senate
nekhludoff
and
the
advocate
walked
on
together
the
advocate
having
given
the
driver
of
his
carriage
orders
to
follow
them
the
advocate
told
nekhludoff
the
story
of
the
chief
of
a
government
department
about
whom
the
senators
had
been
talking
how
the
thing
was
found
out
and
how
the
man
who
according
to
law
should
have
been
sent
to
the
mines
had
been
appointed
governor
of
a
town
in
siberia
then
he
related
with
particular
pleasure
how
several
highplaced
persons
stole
a
lot
of
money
collected
for
the
erection
of
the
still
unfinished
monument
which
they
had
passed
that
morning
also
how
the
mistress
of
soandso
got
a
lot
of
money
at
the
stock
exchange
and
how
soandso
agreed
with
soandso
to
sell
him
his
wife
the
advocate
began
another
story
about
a
swindle
and
all
sorts
of
crimes
committed
by
persons
in
high
places
who
instead
of
being
in
prison
sat
on
presidential
chairs
in
all
sorts
of
government
institutions
these
tales
of
which
the
advocate
seemed
to
have
an
unending
supply
gave
him
much
pleasure
showing
as
they
did
with
perfect
clearness
that
his
means
of
getting
money
were
quite
just
and
innocent
compared
to
the
means
which
the
highest
officials
in
petersburg
made
use
of
the
advocate
was
therefore
surprised
when
nekhludoff
took
an
isvostchik
before
hearing
the
end
of
the
story
said
goodbye
and
left
him
nekhludoff
felt
very
sad
it
was
chiefly
the
rejection
of
the
appeal
by
the
senate
confirming
the
senseless
torments
that
the
innocent
maslova
was
enduring
that
saddened
him
and
also
the
fact
that
this
rejection
made
it
still
harder
for
him
to
unite
his
fate
with
hers
the
stories
about
existing
evils
which
the
advocate
recounted
with
such
relish
heightened
his
sadness
and
so
did
the
cold
unkind
look
that
the
once
sweetnatured
frank
noble
selenin
had
given
him
and
which
kept
recurring
to
his
mind
on
his
return
the
doorkeeper
handed
him
a
note
and
said
rather
scornfully
that
some
kind
of
woman
had
written
it
in
the
hall
it
was
a
note
from
shoustovas
mother
she
wrote
that
she
had
come
to
thank
her
daughters
benefactor
and
saviour
and
to
implore
him
to
come
to
see
them
on
the
vasilievsky
5th
line
house
no

this
was
very
necessary
because
of
vera
doukhova
he
need
not
be
afraid
that
they
would
weary
him
with
expressions
of
gratitude
they
would
not
speak
their
gratitude
but
be
simply
glad
to
see
him
would
he
not
come
next
morning
if
he
could
there
was
another
note
from
bogotyreff
a
former
fellowofficer
aidedecamp
to
the
emperor
whom
nekhludoff
had
asked
to
hand
personally
to
the
emperor
his
petition
on
behalf
of
the
sectarians
bogotyreff
wrote
in
his
large
firm
hand
that
he
would
put
the
petition
into
the
emperors
own
hands
as
he
had
promised
but
that
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
it
might
be
better
for
nekhludoff
first
to
go
and
see
the
person
on
whom
the
matter
depended
after
the
impressions
received
during
the
last
few
days
nekhludoff
felt
perfectly
hopeless
of
getting
anything
done
the
plans
he
had
formed
in
moscow
seemed
now
something
like
the
dreams
of
youth
which
are
inevitably
followed
by
disillusion
when
life
comes
to
be
faced
still
being
now
in
petersburg
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
do
all
he
had
intended
and
he
resolved
next
day
after
consulting
bogotyreff
to
act
on
his
advice
and
see
the
person
on
whom
the
case
of
the
sectarians
depended
he
got
out
the
sectarians
petition
from
his
portfolio
and
began
reading
it
over
when
there
was
a
knock
at
his
door
and
a
footman
came
in
with
a
message
from
the
countess
katerina
ivanovna
who
asked
him
to
come
up
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
her
nekhludoff
said
he
would
come
at
once
and
having
put
the
papers
back
into
the
portfolio
he
went
up
to
his
aunts
he
looked
out
of
a
window
on
his
way
and
saw
mariettes
pair
of
bays
standing
in
front
of
the
house
and
he
suddenly
brightened
and
felt
inclined
to
smile
mariette
with
a
hat
on
her
head
not
in
black
but
with
a
light
dress
of
many
shades
sat
with
a
cup
in
her
hand
beside
the
countesss
easy
chair
prattling
about
something
while
her
beautiful
laughing
eyes
glistened
she
had
said
something
funnysomething
indecently
funnyjust
as
nekhludoff
entered
the
room
he
knew
it
by
the
way
she
laughed
and
by
the
way
the
goodnatured
countess
katerina
ivanovnas
fat
body
was
shaking
with
laughter
while
mariette
her
smiling
mouth
slightly
drawn
to
one
side
her
head
a
little
bent
a
peculiarly
mischievous
expression
in
her
merry
energetic
face
sat
silently
looking
at
her
companion
from
a
few
words
which
he
overheard
nekhludoff
guessed
that
they
were
talking
of
the
second
piece
of
petersburg
news
the
episode
of
the
siberian
governor
and
that
it
was
in
reference
to
this
subject
that
mariette
had
said
something
so
funny
that
the
countess
could
not
control
herself
for
a
long
time
you
will
kill
me
she
said
coughing
after
saying
how
dyou
do
nekhludoff
sat
down
he
was
about
to
censure
mariette
in
his
mind
for
her
levity
when
noticing
the
serious
and
even
slightly
dissatisfied
look
in
his
eyes
she
suddenly
to
please
him
changed
not
only
the
expression
of
her
face
but
also
the
attitude
of
her
mind
for
she
felt
the
wish
to
please
him
as
soon
as
she
looked
at
him
she
suddenly
turned
serious
dissatisfied
with
her
life
as
if
seeking
and
striving
after
something
it
was
not
that
she
pretended
but
she
really
reproduced
in
herself
the
very
same
state
of
mind
that
he
was
in
although
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
her
to
express
in
words
what
was
the
state
of
nekhludoffs
mind
at
that
moment
she
asked
him
how
he
had
accomplished
his
tasks
he
told
her
about
his
failure
in
the
senate
and
his
meeting
selenin
oh
what
a
pure
soul
he
is
indeed
a
chevalier
sans
peur
et
sans
reproche
a
pure
soul
said
both
ladies
using
the
epithet
commonly
applied
to
selenin
in
petersburg
society
what
is
his
wife
like
nekhludoff
asked
his
wife
well
i
do
not
wish
to
judge
but
she
does
not
understand
him
is
it
possible
that
he
too
was
for
rejecting
the
appeal
mariette
asked
with
real
sympathy
it
is
dreadful
how
sorry
i
am
for
her
she
added
with
a
sigh
he
frowned
and
in
order
to
change
the
subject
began
to
speak
about
shoustova
who
had
been
imprisoned
in
the
fortress
and
was
now
set
free
through
the
influence
of
mariettes
husband
he
thanked
her
for
her
trouble
and
was
going
on
to
say
how
dreadful
he
thought
it
that
this
woman
and
the
whole
of
her
family
had
suffered
merely
because
no
one
had
reminded
the
authorities
about
them
but
mariette
interrupted
him
and
expressed
her
own
indignation
say
nothing
about
it
to
me
she
said
when
my
husband
told
me
she
could
be
set
free
it
was
this
that
struck
me
what
was
she
kept
in
prison
for
if
she
is
innocent
she
went
on
expressing
what
nekhludoff
was
about
to
say
it
is
revoltingrevolting
countess
katerina
ivanovna
noticed
that
mariette
was
coquetting
with
her
nephew
and
this
amused
her
what
do
you
think
she
said
when
they
were
silent
supposing
you

be
there
and

she
said
turning
to
mariette
il
vous
a
remarque
she
went
on
to
her
nephew
he
told
me
that
what
you
say
i
repeated
it
all
to
him
is
a
very
good
sign
and
that
you
will
certainly
come
to
christ
you
must
come
absolutely
tell
him
to
mariette
and
come
yourself
countess
in
the
first
place
i
have
no
right
whatever
to
give
any
kind
of
advice
to
the
prince
said
mariette
and
gave
nekhludoff
a
look
that
somehow
established
a
full
comprehension
between
them
of
their
attitude
in
relation
to
the
countesss
words
and
evangelicalism
in
general
secondly
i
do
not
much
care
you
know
yes
i
know
you
always
do
things
the
wrong
way
round
and
according
to
your
own
ideas
my
own
ideas
i
have
faith
like
the
most
simple
peasant
woman
said
mariette
with
a
smile
and
thirdly
i
am
going
to
the
french
theatre
tomorrow
night
ah
and
have
you
seen
thatwhats
her
name
asked
countess
katerina
ivanovna
mariette
gave
the
name
of
a
celebrated
french
actress
you
must
go
most
decidedly
she
is
wonderful
whom
am
i
to
see
first
ma
tantethe
actress
or
the
preacher
nekhludoff
said
with
a
smile
please
dont
catch
at
my
words
i
should
think
the
preacher
first
and
then
the
actress
or
else
the
desire
for
the
sermon
might
vanish
altogether
said
nekhludoff
no
better
begin
with
the
french
theatre
and
do
penance
afterwards
now
then
you
are
not
to
hold
me
up
for
ridicule
the
preacher
is
the
preacher
and
the
theatre
is
the
theatre
one
need
not
weep
in
order
to
be
saved
one
must
have
faith
and
then
one
is
sure
to
be
gay
you
ma
tante
preach
better
than
any
preacher
do
you
know
what
said
mariette
come
into
my
box
tomorrow
i
am
afraid
i
shall
not
be
able
to
the
footman
interrupted
the
conversation
by
announcing
a
visitor
it
was
the
secretary
of
a
philanthropic
society
of
which
the
countess
was
president
oh
that
is
the
dullest
of
men
i
think
i
shall
receive
him
out
there
and
return
to
you
later
on
mariette
give
him
his
tea
said
the
countess
and
left
the
room
with
her
quick
wriggling
walk
mariette
took
the
glove
off
her
firm
rather
flat
hand
the
fourth
finger
of
which
was
covered
with
rings
want
any
she
said
taking
hold
of
the
silver
teapot
under
which
a
spirit
lamp
was
burning
and
extending
her
little
finger
curiously
her
face
looked
sad
and
serious
it
is
always
terribly
painful
to
me
to
notice
that
people
whose
opinion
i
value
confound
me
with
the
position
i
am
placed
in
she
seemed
ready
to
cry
as
she
said
these
last
words
and
though
these
words
had
no
meaning
or
at
any
rate
a
very
indefinite
meaning
they
seemed
to
be
of
exceptional
depth
meaning
or
goodness
to
nekhludoff
so
much
was
he
attracted
by
the
look
of
the
bright
eyes
which
accompanied
the
words
of
this
young
beautiful
and
welldressed
woman
nekhludoff
looked
at
her
in
silence
and
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
her
face
you
think
i
do
not
understand
you
and
all
that
goes
on
in
you
why
everybody
knows
what
you
are
doing
cest
le
secret
de
polichinelle
and
i
am
delighted
with
your
work
and
think
highly
of
you
really
there
is
nothing
to
be
delighted
with
and
i
have
done
so
little
as
yet
no
matter
i
understand
your
feelings
and
i
understand
her
all
right
all
right
i
will
say
nothing
more
about
it
she
said
noticing
displeasure
on
his
face
but
i
also
understand
that
after
seeing
all
the
suffering
and
the
horror
in
the
prisons
mariette
went
on
her
only
desire
that
of
attracting
him
and
guessing
with
her
womans
instinct
what
was
dear
and
important
to
him
you
wish
to
help
the
sufferers
those
who
are
made
to
suffer
so
terribly
by
other
men
and
their
cruelty
and
indifference
i
understand
the
willingness
to
give
ones
life
and
could
give
mine
in
such
a
cause
but
we
each
have
our
own
fate
are
you
then
dissatisfied
with
your
fate
i
she
asked
as
if
struck
with
surprise
that
such
a
question
could
be
put
to
her
i
have
to
be
satisfied
and
am
satisfied
but
there
is
a
worm
that
wakes
up
and
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
fall
asleep
again
it
is
a
voice
that
must
be
obeyed
nekhludoff
said
falling
into
the
trap
many
a
time
later
on
nekhludoff
remembered
with
shame
his
talk
with
her
he
remembered
her
words
which
were
not
so
much
lies
as
imitations
of
his
own
and
her
face
which
seemed
looking
at
him
with
sympathetic
attention
when
he
told
her
about
the
terrors
of
the
prison
and
of
his
impressions
in
the
country
when
the
countess
returned
they
were
talking
not
merely
like
old
but
like
exclusive
friends
who
alone
understood
one
another
they
were
talking
about
the
injustice
of
power
of
the
sufferings
of
the
unfortunate
the
poverty
of
the
people
yet
in
reality
in
the
midst
of
the
sound
of
their
talk
their
eyes
gazing
at
each
other
kept
asking
can
you
love
me
and
answering
i
can
and
the
sexfeeling
taking
the
most
unexpected
and
brightest
forms
drew
them
to
each
other
as
she
was
going
away
she
told
him
that
she
would
always
be
willing
to
serve
him
in
any
way
she
could
and
asked
him
to
come
and
see
her
if
only
for
a
moment
in
the
theatre
next
day
as
she
had
a
very
important
thing
to
tell
him
about
yes
and
when
shall
i
see
you
again
she
added
with
a
sigh
carefully
drawing
the
glove
over
her
jewelled
hand
say
you
will
come
nekhludoff
promised
that
night
when
nekhludoff
was
alone
in
his
room
and
lay
down
after
putting
out
his
candle
he
could
not
sleep
he
thought
of
maslova
of
the
decision
of
the
senate
of
his
resolve
to
follow
her
in
any
case
of
his
having
given
up
the
land
the
face
of
mariette
appeared
to
him
as
if
in
answer
to
those
thoughtsher
look
her
sigh
her
words
when
shall
i
see
you
again
and
her
smile
seemed
vivid
as
if
he
really
saw
her
and
he
also
smiled
shall
i
be
doing
right
in
going
to
siberia
and
have
i
done
right
in
divesting
myself
of
my
wealth
and
the
answers
to
the
questions
on
this
petersburg
night
on
which
the
daylight
streamed
into
the
window
from
under
the
blind
were
quite
indefinite
all
seemed
mixed
in
his
head
he
recalled
his
former
state
of
mind
and
the
former
sequence
of
his
thoughts
but
they
had
no
longer
their
former
power
or
validity
and
supposing
i
have
invented
all
this
and
am
unable
to
live
it
throughsupposing
i
repent
of
having
acted
right
he
thought
and
unable
to
answer
he
was
seized
with
such
anguish
and
despair
as
he
had
long
not
felt
unable
to
free
himself
from
his
perplexity
he
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
such
as
he
had
slept
after
a
heavy
loss
at
cards
chapter
xxv
lydia
shoustovas
home
nekhludoff
awoke
next
morning
feeling
as
if
he
had
been
guilty
of
some
iniquity
the
day
before
he
began
considering
he
could
not
remember
having
done
anything
wrong
he
had
committed
no
evil
act
but
he
had
had
evil
thoughts
he
had
thought
that
all
his
present
resolutions
to
marry
katusha
and
to
give
up
his
land
were
unachievable
dreams
that
he
should
be
unable
to
bear
it
that
it
was
artificial
unnatural
and
that
he
would
have
to
go
on
living
as
he
lived
he
had
committed
no
evil
action
but
what
was
far
worse
than
an
evil
action
he
had
entertained
evil
thoughts
whence
all
evil
actions
proceed
an
evil
action
may
not
be
repeated
and
can
be
repented
of
but
evil
thoughts
generate
all
evil
actions
an
evil
action
only
smooths
the
path
for
other
evil
acts
evil
thoughts
uncontrollably
drag
one
along
that
path
when
nekhludoff
repeated
in
his
mind
the
thoughts
of
the
day
before
he
was
surprised
that
he
could
for
a
moment
have
believed
these
thoughts
however
new
and
difficult
that
which
he
had
decided
to
do
might
be
he
knew
that
it
was
the
only
possible
way
of
life
for
him
now
and
however
easy
and
natural
it
might
have
been
to
return
to
his
former
state
he
knew
that
state
to
be
death
yesterdays
temptation
seemed
like
the
feeling
when
one
awakes
from
deep
sleep
and
without
feeling
sleepy
wants
to
lie
comfortably
in
bed
a
little
longer
yet
knows
that
it
is
time
to
rise
and
commence
the
glad
and
important
work
that
awaits
one
on
that
his
last
day
in
petersburg
he
went
in
the
morning
to
the
vasilievski
ostrov
to
see
shoustova
shoustova
lived
on
the
second
floor
and
having
been
shown
the
back
stairs
nekhludoff
entered
straight
into
the
hot
kitchen
which
smelt
strongly
of
food
an
elderly
woman
with
turnedup
sleeves
with
an
apron
and
spectacles
stood
by
the
fire
stirring
something
in
a
steaming
pan
whom
do
you
want
she
asked
severely
looking
at
him
over
her
spectacles
before
nekhludoff
had
time
to
answer
an
expression
of
fright
and
joy
appeared
on
her
face
oh
prince
she
exclaimed
wiping
her
hands
on
her
apron
but
why
have
you
come
the
back
way
our
benefactor
i
am
her
mother
they
have
nearly
killed
my
little
girl
you
have
saved
us
she
said
catching
hold
of
nekhludoffs
hand
and
trying
to
kiss
it
i
went
to
see
you
yesterday
my
sister
asked
me
to
she
is
here
this
way
this
way
please
said
shoustovas
mother
as
she
led
the
way
through
a
narrow
door
and
a
dark
passage
arranging
her
hair
and
pulling
at
her
tuckedup
skirt
my
sisters
name
is
kornilova
you
must
have
heard
of
her
she
added
stopping
before
a
closed
door
she
was
mixed
up
in
a
political
affair
an
extremely
clever
woman
shoustovas
mother
opened
the
door
and
showed
nekhludoff
into
a
little
room
where
on
a
sofa
with
a
table
before
it
sat
a
plump
short
girl
with
fair
hair
that
curled
round
her
pale
round
face
which
was
very
like
her
mothers
she
had
a
striped
cotton
blouse
on
opposite
her
in
an
armchair
leaning
forward
so
that
he
was
nearly
bent
double
sat
a
young
fellow
with
a
slight
black
beard
and
moustaches
lydia
prince
nekhludoff
he
said
the
pale
girl
jumped
up
nervously
pushing
back
a
lock
of
hair
behind
her
ear
and
gazing
at
the
newcomer
with
a
frightened
look
in
her
large
grey
eyes
so
you
are
that
dangerous
woman
whom
vera
doukhova
wished
me
to
intercede
for
nekhludoff
asked
with
a
smile
yes
i
am
said
lydia
shoustova
her
broad
kind
childlike
smile
disclosing
a
row
of
beautiful
teeth
it
was
aunt
who
was
so
anxious
to
see
you
aunt
she
called
out
in
a
pleasant
tender
voice
through
a
door
your
imprisonment
grieved
vera
doukhova
very
much
said
nekhludoff
take
a
seat
here
or
better
here
said
shoustova
pointing
to
the
battered
easychair
from
which
the
young
man
had
just
risen
my
cousin
zakharov
she
said
noticing
that
nekhludoff
looked
at
the
young
man
the
young
man
greeted
the
visitor
with
a
smile
as
kindly
as
shoustovas
and
when
nekhludoff
sat
down
he
brought
himself
another
chair
and
sat
by
his
side
a
fairhaired
schoolboy
of
about
10
also
came
into
the
room
and
silently
sat
down
on
the
windowsill
vera
doukhova
is
a
great
friend
of
my
aunts
but
i
hardly
know
her
said
shoustova
then
a
woman
with
a
very
pleasant
face
with
a
white
blouse
and
leather
belt
came
in
from
the
next
room
how
do
you
do
thanks
for
coming
she
began
as
soon
as
she
had
taken
the
place
next
shoustovas
on
the
sofa
well
and

nekhludoff
she
says

perfectly
happy

said
the
aunt
smiling
and
shaking
her
head
one
must
know
her
she
has
a
fine
character
everything
for
others
nothing
for
herself
no
she
asked
nothing
for
herself
but
only
seemed
concerned
about
your
niece
what
seemed
to
trouble
her
most
was
as
she
said
that
your
niece
was
imprisoned
for
nothing
yes
thats
true
said
the
aunt
it
is
a
dreadful
business
she
suffered
in
reality
because
of
me
not
at
all
aunt
i
should
have
taken
the
papers
without
you
all
the
same
allow
me
to
know
better
said
the
aunt
you
see
she
went
on
to
nekhludoff
it
all
happened
because
a
certain
person
asked
me
to
keep
his
papers
for
a
time
and
i
having
no
house
at
the
time
brought
them
to
her
and
that
very
night
the
police
searched
her
room
and
took
her
and
the
papers
and
have
kept
her
up
to
now
demanding
that
she
should
say
from
whom
she
had
them
but
i
never
told
them
said
shoustova
quickly
pulling
nervously
at
a
lock
that
was
not
even
out
of
place
i
never
said
you
did
answered
the
aunt
if
they
took
mitin
up
it
was
certainly
not
through
me
said
shoustova
blushing
and
looking
round
uneasily
dont
speak
about
it
lydia
dear
said
her
mother
why
not
i
should
like
to
relate
it
said
shoustova
no
longer
smiling
nor
pulling
her
lock
but
twisting
it
round
her
finger
and
getting
redder
dont
forget
what
happened
yesterday
when
you
began
talking
about
it
not
at
allleave
me
alone
mamma
i
did
not
tell
i
only
kept
quiet
when
he
examined
me
about
mitin
and
about
aunt
i
said
nothing
and
told
him
i
would
not
answer
then
thispetrov

is
a

a

and
a
blackguard
put
in
the
aunt
to
explain
her
nieces
words
to
nekhludoff
then
he
began
persuading
continued
shoustova
excitedly
and
hurriedly
anything
you
tell
me
he
said
can
harm
no
one
on
the
contrary
if
you
tell
me
we
may
be
able
to
set
free
innocent
people
whom
we
may
be
uselessly
tormenting
well
i
still
said
i
would
not
tell
then
he
said
all
right
dont
tell
but
do
not
deny
what
i
am
going
to
say
and
he
named
mitin
dont
talk
about
it
said
the
aunt
oh
aunt
dont
interrupt
and
she
went
on
pulling
the
lock
of
hair
and
looking
round
and
then
only
fancy
the
next
day
i
hearthey
let
me
know
by
knocking
at
the
wallthat
mitin
is
arrested
well
i
think
i
have
betrayed
him
and
this
tormented
me
soit
tormented
me
so
that
i
nearly
went
mad
and
it
turned
out
that
it
was
not
at
all
because
of
you
he
was
taken
up
yes
but
i
didnt
know
i
think
there
now
i
have
betrayed
him
i
walk
and
walk
up
and
down
from
wall
to
wall
and
cannot
help
thinking
i
think
i
have
betrayed
him
i
lie
down
and
cover
myself
up
and
hear
something
whispering
betrayed
betrayed
mitin
mitin
betrayed
i
know
it
is
an
hallucination
but
cannot
help
listening
i
wish
to
fall
asleep
i
cannot
i
wish
not
to
think
and
cannot
cease
that
is
terrible
and
as
shoustova
spoke
she
got
more
and
more
excited
and
twisted
and
untwisted
the
lock
of
hair
round
her
finger
lydia
dear
be
calm
the
mother
said
touching
her
shoulder
but
shoustova
could
not
stop
herself
it
is
all
the
more
terrible
she
began
again
but
did
not
finish
and
jumping
up
with
a
cry
rushed
out
of
the
room
her
mother
turned
to
follow
her

to
be

said
the
schoolboy
who
was
sitting
on
the
windowsill

that
said
the
mother
i
only
saidoh
its
nothing
the
schoolboy
answered
and
taking
a
cigarette
that
lay
on
the
table
he
began
to
smoke

lydias
aunt
yes
that
solitary
confinement
is
terrible
for
the
young
said
the
aunt
shaking
her
head
and
also
lighting
a
cigarette
i
should
say
for
every
one
nekhludoff
replied
no
not
for
all
answered
the
aunt
for
the
real
revolutionists
i
have
been
told
it
is
rest
and
quiet
a
man
who
is
wanted
by
the
police
lives
in
continual
anxiety
material
want
and
fear
for
himself
and
others
and
for
his
cause
and
at
last
when
he
is
taken
up
and
it
is
all
over
and
all
responsibility
is
off
his
shoulders
he
can
sit
and
rest
i
have
been
told
they
actually
feel
joyful
when
taken
up
but
the
young
and
innocent
they
always
first
arrest
the
innocent
like
lydia
for
them
the
first
shock
is
terrible
it
is
not
that
they
deprive
you
of
freedom
and
the
bad
food
and
bad
airall
that
is
nothing
three
times
as
many
privations
would
be
easily
borne
if
it
were
not
for
the
moral
shock
when
one
is
first
taken
have
you
experienced
it
i
i
was
twice
in
prison
she
answered
with
a
sad
gentle
smile
when
i
was
arrested
for
the
first
time
i
had
done
nothing
i
was
22
had
a
child
and
was
expecting
another
though
the
loss
of
freedom
and
the
parting
with
my
child
and
husband
were
hard
they
were
nothing
when
compared
with
what
i
felt
when
i
found
out
that
i
had
ceased
being
a
human
creature
and
had
become
a
thing
i
wished
to
say
goodbye
to
my
little
daughter
i
was
told
to
go
and
get
into
the
trap
i
asked
where
i
was
being
taken
to
the
answer
was
that
i
should
know
when
i
got
there
i
asked
what
i
was
accused
of
but
got
no
reply
after
i
had
been
examined
and
after
they
had
undressed
me
and
put
numbered
prison
clothes
on
me
they
led
me
to
a
vault
opened
a
door
pushed
me
in
and
left
me
alone
a
sentinel
with
a
loaded
gun
paced
up
and
down
in
front
of
my
door
and
every
now
and
then
looked
in
through
a
cracki
felt
terribly
depressed
what
struck
me
most
at
the
time
was
that
the
gendarme
officer
who
examined
me
offered
me
a
cigarette
so
he
knew
that
people
liked
smoking
and
must
know
that
they
liked
freedom
and
light
and
that
mothers
love
their
children
and
children
their
mothers
then
how
could
they
tear
me
pitilessly
from
all
that
was
dear
to
me
and
lock
me
up
in
prison
like
a
wild
animal
that
sort
of
thing
could
not
be
borne
without
evil
effects
any
one
who
believes
in
god
and
men
and
believes
that
men
love
one
another
will
cease
to
believe
it
after
all
that
i
have
ceased
to
believe
in
humanity
since
then
and
have
grown
embittered
she
finished
with
a
smile
shoustovas
mother
came
in
at
the
door
through
which
her
daughter
had
gone
out
and
said
that
lydia
was
very
much
upset
and
would
not
come
in
again
and
what
has
this
young
life
been
ruined
for
said
the
aunt
what
is
especially
painful
to
me
is
that
i
am
the
involuntary
cause
of
it
she
will
recover
in
the
country
with
gods
help
said
the
mother
we
shall
send
her
to
her
father
yes
if
it
were
not
for
you
she
would
have
perished
altogether
said
the
aunt
thank
you
but
what
i
wished
to
see
you
for
is
this
i
wished
to
ask
you
to
take
a
letter
to
vera
doukhova
and
she
got
the
letter
out
of
her
pocket
the
letter
is
not
closed
you
may
read
and
tear
it
up
or
hand
it
to
her
according
to
how
far
it
coincides
with
your
principles
she
said
it
contains
nothing
compromising
nekhludoff
took
the
letter
and
having
promised
to
give
it
to
vera
doukhova
he
took
his
leave
and
went
away
he
sealed
the
letter
without
reading
it
meaning
to
take
it
to
its
destination
chapter
xxvii
the
state
church
and
the
people
the
last
thing
that
kept
nekhludoff
in
petersburg
was
the
case
of
the
sectarians
whose
petition
he
intended
to
get
his
former
fellowofficer
aidedecamp
bogatyreff
to
hand
to
the
tsar
he
came
to
bogatyreff
in
the
morning
and
found
him
about
to
go
out
though
still
at
breakfast
bogatyreff
was
not
tall
but
firmly
built
and
wonderfully
strong
he
could
bend
a
horseshoe
a
kind
honest
straight
and
even
liberal
man
in
spite
of
these
qualities
he
was
intimate
at
court
and
very
fond
of
the
tsar
and
his
family
and
by
some
strange
method
he
managed
while
living
in
that
highest
circle
to
see
nothing
but
the
good
in
it
and
to
take
no
part
in
the
evil
and
corruption
he
never
condemned
anybody
nor
any
measure
and
either
kept
silent
or
spoke
in
a
bold
loud
voice
almost
shouting
what
he
had
to
say
and
often
laughing
in
the
same
boisterous
manner
and
he
did
not
do
it
for
diplomatic
reasons
but
because
such
was
his
character
ah
thats
right
that
you
have
come
would
you
like
some
breakfast
sit
down
the
beefsteaks
are
fine
i
always
begin
with
something
substantialbegin
and
finish
too
ha
ha
ha
well
then
have
a
glass
of
wine
he
shouted
pointing
to
a
decanter
of
claret
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
i
will
hand
on
the
petition
i
shall
put
it
into
his
own
hands
you
may
count
on
that
only
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
best
for
you
to
call
on
toporoff
nekhludoff
made
a
wry
face
at
the
mention
of
toporoff
it
all
depends
on
him
he
will
be
consulted
anyhow
and
perhaps
he
may
himself
meet
your
wishes
if
you
advise
it
i
shall
go
thats
right
well
and
how
does
petersburg
agree
with
you
shouted
bogatyreff
tell
me
eh
i
feel
myself
getting
hypnotised
replied
nekhludoff
hypnotised
bogatyreff
repeated
and
burst
out
laughing
you
wont
have
anything
well
just
as
you
please
and
he
wiped
his
moustaches
with
his
napkin
then
youll
go
eh
if
he
does
not
do
it
give
the
petition
to
me
and
i
shall
hand
it
on
tomorrow
shouting
these
words
he
rose
crossed
himself
just
as
naturally
as
he
had
wiped
his
mouth
and
began
buckling
on
his
sword
and
now
goodbye
i
must
go
we
are
both
going
out
said
nekhludoff
and
shaking
bogatyreffs
strong
broad
hand
and
with
the
sense
of
pleasure
which
the
impression
of
something
healthy
and
unconsciously
fresh
always
gave
him
nekhludoff
parted
from
bogatyreff
on
the
doorsteps
though
he
expected
no
good
result
from
his
visit
still
nekhludoff
following
bogatyreffs
advice
went
to
see
toporoff
on
whom
the
sectarians
fate
depended
the
position
occupied
by
toporoff
involving
as
it
did
an
incongruity
of
purpose
could
only
be
held
by
a
dull
man
devoid
of
moral
sensibility
toporoff
possessed
both
these
negative
qualities
the
incongruity
of
the
position
he
occupied
was
this
it
was
his
duty
to
keep
up
and
to
defend
by
external
measures
not
excluding
violence
that
church
which
by
its
own
declaration
was
established
by
god
himself
and
could
not
be
shaken
by
the
gates
of
hell
nor
by
anything
human
this
divine
and
immutable
godestablished
institution
had
to
be
sustained
and
defended
by
a
human
institutionthe
holy
synod
managed
by
toporoff
and
his
officials
toporoff
did
not
see
this
contradiction
nor
did
he
wish
to
see
it
and
he
was
therefore
much
concerned
lest
some
romish
priest
some
pastor
or
some
sectarian
should
destroy
that
church
which
the
gates
of
hell
could
not
conquer
toporoff
like
all
those
who
are
quite
destitute
of
the
fundamental
religious
feeling
that
recognises
the
equality
and
brotherhood
of
men
was
fully
convinced
that
the
common
people
were
creatures
entirely
different
from
himself
and
that
the
people
needed
what
he
could
very
well
do
without
for
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
believed
in
nothing
and
found
such
a
state
very
convenient
and
pleasant
yet
he
feared
lest
the
people
might
also
come
to
such
a
state
and
looked
upon
it
as
his
sacred
duty
as
he
called
it
to
save
the
people
therefrom
a
certain
cookery
book
declares
that
some
crabs
like
to
be
boiled
alive
in
the
same
way
he
thought
and
spoke
as
if
the
people
liked
being
kept
in
superstition
only
he
meant
this
in
a
literal
sense
whereas
the
cookery
book
did
not
mean
its
words
literally
his
feelings
towards
the
religion
he
was
keeping
up
were
the
same
as
those
of
the
poultrykeeper
towards
the
carrion
he
fed
his
fowls
on
carrion
was
very
disgusting
but
the
fowls
liked
it
therefore
it
was
right
to
feed
the
fowls
on
carrion
of
course
all
this
worship
of
the
images
of
the
iberian
kasan
and
smolensk
mothers
of
god
was
a
gross
superstition
but
the
people
liked
it
and
believed
in
it
and
therefore
the
superstition
must
be
kept
up
thus
thought
toporoff
not
considering
that
the
people
only
liked
superstition
because
there
always
have
been
and
still
are
men
like
himself
who
being
enlightened
instead
of
using
their
light
to
help
others
to
struggle
out
of
their
dark
ignorance
use
it
to
plunge
them
still
deeper
into
it
when
nekhludoff
entered
the
receptionroom
toporoff
was
in
his
study
talking
with
an
abbess
a
lively
and
aristocratic
lady
who
was
spreading
the
greek
orthodox
faith
in
western
russia
among
the
uniates
who
acknowledge
the
pope
of
rome
and
who
have
the
greek
religion
enforced
on
them
an
official
who
was
in
the
receptionroom
inquired
what
nekhludoff
wanted
and
when
he
heard
that
nekhludoff
meant
to
hand
in
a
petition
to
the
emperor
he
asked
him
if
he
would
allow
the
petition
to
be
read
first
nekhludoff
gave
it
him
and
the
official
took
it
into
the
study
the
abbess
with
her
hood
and
flowing
veil
and
her
long
train
trailing
behind
left
the
study
and
went
out
her
white
hands
with
their
welltended
nails
holding
a
topaz
rosary
nekhludoff
was
not
immediately
asked
to
come
in
toporoff
was
reading
the
petition
and
shaking
his
head
he
was
unpleasantly
surprised
by
the
clear
and
emphatic
wording
of
it
if
it
gets
into
the
hands
of
the
emperor
it
may
cause
misunderstandings
and
unpleasant
questions
may
be
asked
he
thought
as
he
read
then
he
put
the
petition
on
the
table
rang
and
ordered
nekhludoff
to
be
asked
in
he
remembered
the
case
of
the
sectarians
he
had
had
a
petition
from
them
before
the
case
was
this
these
christians
fallen
away
from
the
greek
orthodox
church
were
first
exhorted
and
then
tried
by
law
but
were
acquitted
then
the
archdeacon
and
the
governor
arranged
on
the
plea
that
their
marriages
were
illegal
to
exile
these
sectarians
separating
the
husbands
wives
and
children
these
fathers
and
wives
were
now
petitioning
that
they
should
not
be
parted
toporoff
recollected
the
first
time
the
case
came
to
his
notice
he
had
at
that
time
hesitated
whether
he
had
not
better
put
a
stop
to
it
but
then
he
thought
no
harm
could
result
from
his
confirming
the
decision
to
separate
and
exile
the
different
members
of
the
sectarian
families
whereas
allowing
the
peasant
sect
to
remain
where
it
was
might
have
a
bad
effect
on
the
rest
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
and
cause
them
to
fall
away
from
orthodoxy
and
then
the
affair
also
proved
the
zeal
of
the
archdeacon
and
so
he
let
the
case
proceed
along
the
lines
it
had
taken
but
now
that
they
had
a
defender
such
as
nekhludoff
who
had
some
influence
in
petersburg
the
case
might
be
specially
pointed
out
to
the
emperor
as
something
cruel
or
it
might
get
into
the
foreign
papers
therefore
he
at
once
took
an
unexpected
decision
how
do
you
do
he
said
with
the
air
of
a
very
busy
man
receiving
nekhludoff
standing
and
at
once
starting
on
the
business
i
know
this
case
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
names
i
recollected
this
unfortunate
business
he
said
taking
up
the
petition
and
showing
it
to
nekhludoff
and
i
am
much
indebted
to
you
for
reminding
me
of
it
it
is
the
overzealousness
of
the
provincial
authorities
nekhludoff
stood
silent
looking
with
no
kindly
feelings
at
the
immovable
pale
mask
of
a
face
before
him
and
i
shall
give
orders
that
these
measures
should
be
revoked
and
the
people
reinstated
in
their
homes
so
that
i
need
not
make
use
of
this
petition
i
promise
you
most
assuredly
answered
toporoff
laying
a
stress
on
the
word
i
as
if
quite
convinced
that
his
honesty
his
word
was
the
best
guarantee
it
will
be
best
if
i
write
at
once
take
a
seat
please
he
went
up
to
the
table
and
began
to
write
as
nekhludoff
sat
down
he
looked
at
the
narrow
bald
skull
at
the
fat
blueveined
hand
that
was
swiftly
guiding
the
pen
and
wondered
why
this
evidently
indifferent
man
was
doing
what
he
did
and
why
he
was
doing
it
with
such
care
well
here
you
are
said
toporoff
sealing
the
envelope
you
may
let
your
clients
know
and
he
stretched
his
lips
to
imitate
a
smile
then
what
did
these
people
suffer
for
nekhludoff
asked
as
he
took
the
envelope
toporoff
raised
his
head
and
smiled
as
if
nekhludoffs
question
gave
him
pleasure
that
i
cannot
tell
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
interests
of
the
people
guarded
by
us
are
so
important
that
too
great
a
zeal
in
matters
of
religion
is
not
so
dangerous
or
so
harmful
as
the
indifference
which
is
now
spreading
but
how
is
it
that
in
the
name
of
religion
the
very
first
demands
of
righteousness
are
violatedfamilies
are
separated
toporoff
continued
to
smile
patronisingly
evidently
thinking
what
nekhludoff
said
very
pretty
anything
that
nekhludoff
could
say
he
would
have
considered
very
pretty
and
very
onesided
from
the
height
of
what
he
considered
his
farreaching
office
in
the
state
it
may
seem
so
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
private
individual
he
said
but
from
an
administrative
point
of
view
it
appears
in
a
rather
different
light
however
i
must
bid
you
goodbye
now
said
toporoff
bowing
his
head
and
holding
out
his
hand
which
nekhludoff
pressed
the
interests
of
the
people
your
interests
is
what
you
mean
thought
nekhludoff
as
he
went
out
and
he
ran
over
in
his
mind
the
people
in
whom
is
manifested
the
activity
of
the
institutions
that
uphold
religion
and
educate
the
people
he
began
with
the
woman
punished
for
the
illicit
sale
of
spirits
the
boy
for
theft
the
tramp
for
tramping
the
incendiary
for
setting
a
house
on
fire
the
banker
for
fraud
and
that
unfortunate
lydia
shoustova
imprisoned
only
because
they
hoped
to
get
such
information
as
they
required
from
her
then
he
thought
of
the
sectarians
punished
for
violating
orthodoxy
and
gourkevitch
for
wanting
constitutional
government
and
nekhludoff
clearly
saw
that
all
these
people
were
arrested
locked
up
exiled
not
really
because
they
transgressed
against
justice
or
behaved
unlawfully
but
only
because
they
were
an
obstacle
hindering
the
officials
and
the
rich
from
enjoying
the
property
they
had
taken
away
from
the
people
and
the
woman
who
sold
wine
without
having
a
license
and
the
thief
knocking
about
the
town
and
lydia
shoustova
hiding
proclamations
and
the
sectarians
upsetting
superstitions
and
gourkevitch
desiring
a
constitution
were
a
real
hindrance
it
seemed
perfectly
clear
to
nekhludoff
that
all
these
officials
beginning
with
his
aunts
husband
the
senators
and
toporoff
down
to
those
clean
and
correct
gentlemen
who
sat
at
the
tables
in
the
ministry
office
were
not
at
all
troubled
by
the
fact
that
that
in
such
a
state
of
things
the
innocent
had
to
suffer
but
were
only
concerned
how
to
get
rid
of
the
really
dangerous
so
that
the
rule
that
ten
guilty
should
escape
rather
than
that
one
innocent
should
be
condemned
was
not
observed
but
on
the
contrary
for
the
sake
of
getting
rid
of
one
really
dangerous
person
ten
who
seemed
dangerous
were
punished
as
when
cutting
a
rotten
piece
out
of
anything
one
has
to
cut
away
some
that
is
good
this
explanation
seemed
very
simple
and
clear
to
nekhludoff
but
its
very
simplicity
and
clearness
made
him
hesitate
to
accept
it
was
it
possible
that
so
complicated
a
phenomenon
could
have
so
simple
and
terrible
an
explanation
was
it
possible
that
all
these
words
about
justice
law
religion
and
god
and
so
on
were
mere
words
hiding
the
coarsest
cupidity
and
cruelty
chapter

the
meaning
of
mariettes
attraction
nekhludoff
would
have
left
petersburg
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
but
he
had
promised
mariette
to
meet
her
at
the
theatre
and
though
he
knew
that
he
ought
not
to
keep
that
promise
he
deceived
himself
into
the
belief
that
it
would
not
be
right
to
break
his
word
am
i
capable
of
withstanding
these
temptations
he
asked
himself
not
quite
honestly
i
shall
try
for
the
last
time
he
dressed
in
his
evening
clothes
and
arrived
at
the
theatre
during
the
second
act
of
the
eternal
dame
aux
camelias
in
which
a
foreign
actress
once
again
and
in
a
novel
manner
showed
how
women
die
of
consumption
the
theatre
was
quite
full
mariettes
box
was
at
once
and
with
great
deference
shown
to
nekhludoff
at
his
request
a
liveried
servant
stood
in
the
corridor
outside
he
bowed
to
nekhludoff
as
to
one
whom
he
knew
and
opened
the
door
of
the
box
all
the
people
who
sat
and
stood
in
the
boxes
on
the
opposite
side
those
who
sat
near
and
those
who
were
in
the
parterre
with
their
grey
grizzly
bald
or
curly
headsall
were
absorbed
in
watching
the
thin
bony
actress
who
dressed
in
silks
and
laces
was
wriggling
before
them
and
speaking
in
an
unnatural
voice
some
one
called
hush
when
the
door
opened
and
two
streams
one
of
cool
the
other
of
hot
air
touched
nekhludoffs
face
mariette
and
a
lady
whom
he
did
not
know
with
a
red
cape
and
a
big
heavy
headdress
were
in
the
box
and
two
men
also
mariettes
husband
the
general
a
tall
handsome
man
with
a
severe
inscrutable
countenance
a
roman
nose
and
a
uniform
padded
round
the
chest
and
a
fair
man
with
a
bit
of
shaved
chin
between
pompous
whiskers
mariette
graceful
slight
elegant
her
lownecked
dress
showing
her
firm
shapely
slanting
shoulders
with
a
little
black
mole
where
they
joined
her
neck
immediately
turned
and
pointed
with
her
face
to
a
chair
behind
her
in
an
engaging
manner
and
smiled
a
smile
that
seemed
full
of
meaning
to
nekhludoff
the
husband
looked
at
him
in
the
quiet
way
in
which
he
did
everything
and
bowed
in
the
look
he
exchanged
with
his
wife
the
master
the
owner
of
a
beautiful
woman
was
to
be
seen
at
once
when
the
monologue
was
over
the
theatre
resounded
with
the
clapping
of
hands
mariette
rose
and
holding
up
her
rustling
silk
skirt
went
into
the
back
of
the
box
and
introduced
nekhludoff
to
her
husband
the
general
without
ceasing
to
smile
with
his
eyes
said
he
was
very
pleased
and
then
sat
inscrutably
silent
i
ought
to
have
left
today
had
i
not
promised
said
nekhludoff
to
mariette
if
you
do
not
care
to
see
me
said
mariette
in
answer
to
what
his
words
implied
you
will
see
a
wonderful
actress
was
she
not
splendid
in
the
last
scene
she
asked
turning
to
her
husband
the
husband
bowed
his
head
this
sort
of
thing
does
not
touch
me
said
nekhludoff
i
have
seen
so
much
real
suffering
lately
that
yes
sit
down
and
tell
me
the
husband
listened
his
eyes
smiling
more
and
more
ironically
i
have
been
to
see
that
woman
whom
they
have
set
free
and
who
has
been
kept
in
prison
for
so
long
she
is
quite
broken
down
that
is
the
woman
i
spoke
to
you
about
mariette
said
to
her
husband
oh
yes
i
was
very
pleased
that
she
could
be
set
free
said
the
husband
quietly
nodding
and
smiling
under
his
moustache
with
evident
irony
so
it
seemed
to
nekhludoff
i
shall
go
and
have
a
smoke
nekhludoff
sat
waiting
to
hear
what
the
something
was
that
mariette
had
to
tell
him
she
said
nothing
and
did
not
even
try
to
say
anything
but
joked
and
spoke
about
the
performance
which
she
thought
ought
to
touch
nekhludoff
nekhludoff
saw
that
she
had
nothing
to
tell
but
only
wished
to
show
herself
to
him
in
all
the
splendour
of
her
evening
toilet
with
her
shoulders
and
little
mole
and
this
was
pleasant
and
yet
repulsive
to
him
the
charm
that
had
veiled
all
this
sort
of
thing
from
nekhludoff
was
not
removed
but
it
was
as
if
he
could
see
what
lay
beneath
looking
at
mariette
he
admired
her
and
yet
he
knew
that
she
was
a
liar
living
with
a
husband
who
was
making
his
career
by
means
of
the
tears
and
lives
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
people
and
that
she
was
quite
indifferent
about
it
and
that
all
she
had
said
the
day
before
was
untrue
what
she
wantedneither
he
nor
she
knew
whywas
to
make
him
fall
in
love
with
her
this
both
attracted
and
disgusted
him
several
times
on
the
point
of
going
away
he
took
up
his
hat
and
then
stayed
on
but
at
last
when
the
husband
returned
with
a
strong
smell
of
tobacco
in
his
thick
moustache
and
looked
at
nekhludoff
with
a
patronising
contemptuous
air
as
if
not
recognising
him
nekhludoff
left
the
box
before
the
door
was
closed
again
found
his
overcoat
and
went
out
of
the
theatre
as
he
was
walking
home
along
the
nevski
he
could
not
help
noticing
a
wellshaped
and
aggressively
finelydressed
woman
who
was
quietly
walking
in
front
of
him
along
the
broad
asphalt
pavement
the
consciousness
of
her
detestable
power
was
noticeable
in
her
face
and
the
whole
of
her
figure
all
who
met
or
passed
that
woman
looked
at
her
nekhludoff
walked
faster
than
she
did
and
involuntarily
also
looked
her
in
the
face
the
face
which
was
probably
painted
was
handsome
and
the
woman
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
and
her
eyes
sparkled
and
curiously
enough
nekhludoff
was
suddenly
reminded
of
mariette
because
he
again
felt
both
attracted
and
disgusted
just
as
when
in
the
theatre
having
hurriedly
passed
her
nekhludoff
turned
off
on
to
the
morskaya
and
passed
on
to
the
embankment
where
to
the
surprise
of
a
policeman
he
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
pavement
the
other
one
gave
me
just
such
a
smile
when
i
entered
the
theatre
he
thought
and
the
meaning
of
the
smile
was
the
same
the
only
difference
is
that
this
one
said
plainly
if
you
want
me
take
me
if
not
go
your
way
and
the
other
one
pretended
that
she
was
not
thinking
of
this
but
living
in
some
high
and
refined
state
while
this
was
really
at
the
root
besides
this
one
was
driven
to
it
by
necessity
while
the
other
amused
herself
by
playing
with
that
enchanting
disgusting
frightful
passion
this
woman
of
the
street
was
like
stagnant
smelling
water
offered
to
those
whose
thirst
was
greater
than
their
disgust
that
other
one
in
the
theatre
was
like
the
poison
which
unnoticed
poisons
everything
it
gets
into
nekhludoff
recalled
his
liaison
with
the
marechals
wife
and
shameful
memories
rose
before
him
the
animalism
of
the
brute
nature
in
man
is
disgusting
thought
he
but
as
long
as
it
remains
in
its
naked
form
we
observe
it
from
the
height
of
our
spiritual
life
and
despise
it
andwhether
one
has
fallen
or
resistedone
remains
what
one
was
before
but
when
that
same
animalism
hides
under
a
cloak
of
poetry
and
aesthetic
feeling
and
demands
our
worshipthen
we
are
swallowed
up
by
it
completely
and
worship
animalism
no
longer
distinguishing
good
from
evil
then
it
is
awful
nekhludoff
perceived
all
this
now
as
clearly
as
he
saw
the
palace
the
sentinels
the
fortress
the
river
the
boats
and
the
stock
exchange
and
just
as
on
this
northern
summer
night
there
was
no
restful
darkness
on
the
earth
but
only
a
dismal
dull
light
coming
from
an
invisible
source
so
in
nekhludoffs
soul
there
was
no
longer
the
restful
darkness
ignorance
everything
seemed
clear
it
was
clear
that
everything
considered
important
and
good
was
insignificant
and
repulsive
and
that
all
the
glamour
and
luxury
hid
the
old
wellknown
crimes
which
not
only
remained
unpunished
but
were
adorned
with
all
the
splendour
which
men
were
capable
of
inventing
nekhludoff
wished
to
forget
all
this
not
to
see
it
but
he
could
no
longer
help
seeing
it
though
he
could
not
see
the
source
of
the
light
which
revealed
it
to
him
any
more
than
he
could
see
the
source
of
the
light
which
lay
over
petersburg
and
though
the
light
appeared
to
him
dull
dismal
and
unnatural
yet
he
could
not
help
seeing
what
it
revealed
and
he
felt
both
joyful
and
anxious
chapter
xxix
for
her
sake
and
for
gods
on
his
return
to
moscow
nekhludoff
went
at
once
to
the
prison
hospital
to
bring
maslova
the
sad
news
that
the
senate
had
confirmed
the
decision
of
the
court
and
that
she
must
prepare
to
go
to
siberia
he
had
little
hope
of
the
success
of
his
petition
to
the
emperor
which
the
advocate
had
written
for
him
and
which
he
now
brought
with
him
for
maslova
to
sign
and
strange
to
say
he
did
not
at
present
even
wish
to
succeed
he
had
got
used
to
the
thought
of
going
to
siberia
and
living
among
the
exiled
and
the
convicts
and
he
could
not
easily
picture
to
himself
how
his
life
and
maslovas
would
shape
if
she
were
acquitted
he
remembered
the
thought
of
the
american
writer
thoreau
who
at
the
time
when
slavery
existed
in
america
said
that
under
a
government
that
imprisons
any
unjustly
the
true
place
for
a
just
man
is
also
a
prison
nekhludoff
especially
after
his
visit
to
petersburg
and
all
he
discovered
there
thought
in
the
same
way
yes
the
only
place
befitting
an
honest
man
in
russia
at
the
present
time
is
a
prison
he
thought
and
even
felt
that
this
applied
to
him
personally
when
he
drove
up
to
the
prison
and
entered
its
walls
the
doorkeeper
recognised
nekhludoff
and
told
him
at
once
that
maslova
was
no
longer
there
where
is
she
then
in
the
cell
again
why
has
she
been
removed
nekhludoff
asked
oh
your
excellency
what
are
such
people
said
the
doorkeeper
contemptuously
shes
been
carrying
on
with
the
medical
assistant
so
the
head
doctor
ordered
her
back
nekhludoff
had
had
no
idea
how
near
maslova
and
the
state
of
her
mind
were
to
him
he
was
stunned
by
the
news
he
felt
as
one
feels
at
the
news
of
a
great
and
unforeseen
misfortune
and
his
pain
was
very
severe
his
first
feeling
was
one
of
shame
he
with
his
joyful
idea
of
the
change
that
he
imagined
was
going
on
in
her
soul
now
seemed
ridiculous
in
his
own
eyes
he
thought
that
all
her
pretence
of
not
wishing
to
accept
his
sacrifice
all
the
reproaches
and
tears
were
only
the
devices
of
a
depraved
woman
who
wished
to
use
him
to
the
best
advantage
he
seemed
to
remember
having
seen
signs
of
obduracy
at
his
last
interview
with
her
all
this
flashed
through
his
mind
as
he
instinctively
put
on
his
hat
and
left
the
hospital
what
am
i
to
do
now
am
i
still
bound
to
her
has
this
action
of
hers
not
set
me
free
and
as
he
put
these
questions
to
himself
he
knew
at
once
that
if
he
considered
himself
free
and
threw
her
up
he
would
be
punishing
himself
and
not
her
which
was
what
he
wished
to
do
and
he
was
seized
with
fear
no
what
has
happened
cannot
alterit
can
only
strengthen
my
resolve
let
her
do
what
flows
from
the
state
her
mind
is
in
if
it
is
carrying
on
with
the
medical
assistant
let
her
carry
on
with
the
medical
assistant
that
is
her
business
i
must
do
what
my
conscience
demands
of
me
and
my
conscience
expects
me
to
sacrifice
my
freedom
my
resolution
to
marry
her
if
only
in
form
and
to
follow
wherever
she
may
be
sent
remains
unalterable
nekhludoff
said
all
this
to
himself
with
vicious
obstinacy
as
he
left
the
hospital
and
walked
with
resolute
steps
towards
the
big
gates
of
the
prison
he
asked
the
warder
on
duty
at
the
gate
to
inform
the
inspector
that
he
wished
to
see
maslova
the
warder
knew
nekhludoff
and
told
him
of
an
important
change
that
had
taken
place
in
the
prison
the
old
inspector
had
been
discharged
and
a
new
very
severe
official
appointed
in
his
place
they
are
so
strict
nowadays
its
just
awful
said
the
jailer
he
is
in
here
they
will
let
him
know
directly
the
new
inspector
was
in
the
prison
and
soon
came
to
nekhludoff
he
was
a
tall
angular
man
with
high
cheek
bones
morose
and
very
slow
in
his
movements
interviews
are
allowed
in
the
visiting
room
on
the
appointed
days
he
said
without
looking
at
nekhludoff
but
i
have
a
petition
to
the
emperor
which
i
want
signed
you
can
give
it
to
me
i
must
see
the
prisoner
myself
i
was
always
allowed
to
before
that
was
so
before
said
the
inspector
with
a
furtive
glance
at
nekhludoff
i
have
a
permission
from
the
governor
insisted
nekhludoff
and
took
out
his
pocketbook
allow
me
said
the
inspector
taking
the
paper
from
nekhludoff
with
his
long
dry
white
fingers
on
the
first
of
which
was
a
gold
ring
still
without
looking
him
in
the
eyes
he
read
the
paper
slowly
step
into
the
office
please
this
time
the
office
was
empty
the
inspector
sat
down
by
the
table
and
began
sorting
some
papers
that
lay
on
it
evidently
intending
to
be
present
at
the
interview
when
nekhludoff
asked
whether
he
might
see
the
political
prisoner
doukhova
the
inspector
answered
shortly
that
he
could
not
interviews
with
political
prisoners
are
not
permitted
he
said
and
again
fixed
his
attention
on
his
papers
with
a
letter
to
doukhova
in
his
pocket
nekhludoff
felt
as
if
he
had
committed
some
offence
and
his
plans
had
been
discovered
and
frustrated
when
maslova
entered
the
room
the
inspector
raised
his
head
and
without
looking
at
either
her
or
nekhludoff
remarked
you
may
talk
and
went
on
sorting
his
papers
maslova
had
again
the
white
jacket
petticoat
and
kerchief
on
when
she
came
up
to
nekhludoff
and
saw
his
cold
hard
look
she
blushed
scarlet
and
crumbling
the
hem
of
her
jacket
with
her
hand
she
cast
down
her
eyes
her
confusion
so
it
seemed
to
nekhludoff
confirmed
the
hospital
doorkeepers
words
nekhludoff
had
meant
to
treat
her
in
the
same
way
as
before
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
shake
hands
with
her
so
disgusting
was
she
to
him
now
i
have
brought
you
bad
news
he
said
in
a
monotonous
voice
without
looking
at
her
or
taking
her
hand
the
senate
has
refused
i
knew
it
would
she
said
in
a
strange
tone
as
if
she
were
gasping
for
breath
formerly
nekhludoff
would
have
asked
why
she
said
she
knew
it
would
now
he
only
looked
at
her
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
but
this
did
not
soften
him
it
roused
his
irritation
against
her
even
more
the
inspector
rose
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
in
spite
of
the
disgust
nekhludoff
was
feeling
at
the
moment
he
considered
it
right
to
express
his
regret
at
the
senates
decision
you
must
not
despair
he
said
the
petition
to
the
emperor
may
meet
with
success
and
i
hope
im
not
thinking
of
that
she
said
looking
piteously
at
him
with
her
wet
squinting
eyes
what
is
it
then
you
have
been
to
the
hospital
and
they
have
most
likely
told
you
about
me
what
of
that
that
is
your
affair
said
nekhludoff
coldly
and
frowned
the
cruel
feeling
of
wounded
pride
that
had
quieted
down
rose
with
renewed
force
when
she
mentioned
the
hospital
he
a
man
of
the
world
whom
any
girl
of
the
best
families
would
think
it
happiness
to
marry
offered
himself
as
a
husband
to
this
woman
and
she
could
not
even
wait
but
began
intriguing
with
the
medical
assistant
thought
he
with
a
look
of
hatred
here
sign
this
petition
he
said
taking
a
large
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
laying
the
paper
on
the
table
she
wiped
the
tears
with
a
corner
of
her
kerchief
and
asked
what
to
write
and
where
he
showed
her
and
she
sat
down
and
arranged
the
cuff
of
her
right
sleeve
with
her
left
hand
he
stood
behind
her
and
silently
looked
at
her
back
which
shook
with
suppressed
emotion
and
evil
and
good
feelings
were
fighting
in
his
breastfeelings
of
wounded
pride
and
of
pity
for
her
who
was
sufferingand
the
last
feeling
was
victorious
he
could
not
remember
which
came
first
did
the
pity
for
her
first
enter
his
heart
or
did
he
first
remember
his
own
sinshis
own
repulsive
actions
the
very
same
for
which
he
was
condemning
her
anyhow
he
both
felt
himself
guilty
and
pitied
her
having
signed
the
petition
and
wiped
her
inky
finger
on
her
petticoat
she
got
up
and
looked
at
him
whatever
happens
whatever
comes
of
it
my
resolve
remains
unchanged
said
nekhludoff
the
thought
that
he
had
forgiven
her
heightened
his
feeling
of
pity
and
tenderness
for
her
and
he
wished
to
comfort
her
i
will
do
what
i
have
said
wherever
they
take
you
i
shall
be
with
you
whats
the
use
she
interrupted
hurriedly
though
her
whole
face
lighted
up
think
what
you
will
want
on
the
way
i
dont
know
of
anything
in
particular
thank
you
the
inspector
came
up
and
without
waiting
for
a
remark
from
him
nekhludoff
took
leave
and
went
out
with
peace
joy
and
love
towards
everybody
in
his
heart
such
as
he
had
never
felt
before
the
certainty
that
no
action
of
maslova
could
change
his
love
for
her
filled
him
with
joy
and
raised
him
to
a
level
which
he
had
never
before
attained
let
her
intrigue
with
the
medical
assistant
that
was
her
business
he
loved
her
not
for
his
own
but
for
her
sake
and
for
gods
and
this
intrigue
for
which
maslova
was
turned
out
of
the
hospital
and
of
which
nekhludoff
believed
she
was
really
guilty
consisted
of
the
following
maslova
was
sent
by
the
head
nurse
to
get
some
herb
tea
from
the
dispensary
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
there
all
alone
she
found
the
medical
assistant
a
tall
man
with
a
blotchy
face
who
had
for
a
long
time
been
bothering
her
in
trying
to
get
away
from
him
maslova
gave
him
such
a
push
that
he
knocked
his
head
against
a
shelf
from
which
two
bottles
fell
and
broke
the
head
doctor
who
was
passing
at
that
moment
heard
the
sound
of
breaking
glass
and
saw
maslova
run
out
quite
red
and
shouted
to
her
ah
my
good
woman
if
you
start
intriguing
here
ill
send
you
about
your
business
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
he
went
on
addressing
the
medical
assistant
and
looking
at
him
over
his
spectacles
the
assistant
smiled
and
began
to
justify
himself
the
doctor
gave
no
heed
to
him
but
lifting
his
head
so
that
he
now
looked
through
his
spectacles
he
entered
the
ward
he
told
the
inspector
the
same
day
to
send
another
more
sedate
assistantnurse
in
maslovas
place
and
this
was
her
intrigue
with
the
medical
assistant
being
turned
out
for
a
love
intrigue
was
particularly
painful
to
maslova
because
the
relations
with
men
which
had
long
been
repulsive
to
her
had
become
specially
disgusting
after
meeting
nekhludoff
the
thought
that
judging
her
by
her
past
and
present
position
every
man
the
blotchy
assistant
among
them
considered
he
had
a
right
to
offend
her
and
was
surprised
at
her
refusal
hurt
her
deeply
and
made
her
pity
herself
and
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
when
she
went
out
to
nekhludoff
this
time
she
wished
to
clear
herself
of
the
false
charge
which
she
knew
he
would
certainly
have
heard
about
but
when
she
began
to
justify
herself
she
felt
he
did
not
believe
her
and
that
her
excuses
would
only
strengthen
his
suspicions
tears
choked
her
and
she
was
silent
maslova
still
thought
and
continued
to
persuade
herself
that
she
had
never
forgiven
him
and
hated
him
as
she
told
him
at
their
second
interview
but
in
reality
she
loved
him
again
and
loved
him
so
that
she
did
all
he
wished
her
to
do
left
off
drinking
smoking
coquetting
and
entered
the
hospital
because
she
knew
he
wished
it
and
if
every
time
he
reminded
her
of
it
she
refused
so
decidedly
to
accept
his
sacrifice
and
marry
him
it
was
because
she
liked
repeating
the
proud
words
she
had
once
uttered
and
because
she
knew
that
a
marriage
with
her
would
be
a
misfortune
for
him
she
had
resolutely
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
accept
his
sacrifice
and
yet
the
thought
that
he
despised
her
and
believed
that
she
still
was
what
she
had
been
and
did
not
notice
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
her
was
very
painful
that
he
could
still
think
she
had
done
wrong
while
in
the
hospital
tormented
her
more
than
the
news
that
her
sentence
was
confirmed
chapter
xxx
the
astonishing
institution
called
criminal
law
maslova
might
be
sent
off
with
the
first
gang
of
prisoners
therefore
nekhludoff
got
ready
for
his
departure
but
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
that
he
felt
that
he
could
not
finish
it
however
much
time
he
might
have
it
was
quite
different
now
from
what
it
had
been
formerly
he
used
to
be
obliged
to
look
for
an
occupation
the
interest
of
which
always
centred
in
one
person
ie
dmitri
ivanovitch
nekhludoff
and
yet
though
every
interest
of
his
life
was
thus
centred
all
these
occupations
were
very
wearisome
now
all
his
occupations
related
to
other
people
and
not
to
dmitri
ivanovitch
and
they
were
all
interesting
and
attractive
and
there
was
no
end
to
them
nor
was
this
all
formerly
dmitri
ivanovitch
nekhludoffs
occupations
always
made
him
feel
vexed
and
irritable
now
they
produced
a
joyful
state
of
mind
the
business
at
present
occupying
nekhludoff
could
be
divided
under
three
headings
he
himself
with
his
usual
pedantry
divided
it
in
that
way
and
accordingly
kept
the
papers
referring
to
it
in
three
different
portfolios
the
first
referred
to
maslova
and
was
chiefly
that
of
taking
steps
to
get
her
petition
to
the
emperor
attended
to
and
preparing
for
her
probable
journey
to
siberia
the
second
was
about
his
estates
in
panovo
he
had
given
the
land
to
the
peasants
on
condition
of
their
paying
rent
to
be
put
to
their
own
communal
use
but
he
had
to
confirm
this
transaction
by
a
legal
deed
and
to
make
his
will
in
accordance
with
it
in
kousminski
the
state
of
things
was
still
as
he
had
first
arranged
it
ie
he
was
to
receive
the
rent
but
the
terms
had
to
be
fixed
and
also
how
much
of
the
money
he
would
use
to
live
on
and
how
much
he
would
leave
for
the
peasants
use
as
he
did
not
know
what
his
journey
to
siberia
would
cost
him
he
could
not
decide
to
lose
this
revenue
altogether
though
he
reduced
the
income
from
it
by
half
the
third
part
of
his
business
was
to
help
the
convicts
who
applied
more
and
more
often
to
him
at
first
when
he
came
in
contact
with
the
prisoners
and
they
appealed
to
him
for
help
he
at
once
began
interceding
for
them
hoping
to
lighten
their
fate
but
he
soon
had
so
many
applications
that
he
felt
the
impossibility
of
attending
to
all
of
them
and
that
naturally
led
him
to
take
up
another
piece
of
work
which
at
last
roused
his
interest
even
more
than
the
three
first
this
new
part
of
his
business
was
finding
an
answer
to
the
following
questions
what
was
this
astonishing
institution
called
criminal
law
of
which
the
results
were
that
in
the
prison
with
some
of
the
inmates
of
which
he
had
lately
become
acquainted
and
in
all
those
other
places
of
confinement
from
the
peter
and
paul
fortress
in
petersburg
to
the
island
of
sakhalin
hundreds
and
thousands
of
victims
were
pining
what
did
this
strange
criminal
law
exist
for
how
had
it
originated
from
his
personal
relations
with
the
prisoners
from
notes
by
some
of
those
in
confinement
and
by
questioning
the
advocate
and
the
prison
priest
nekhludoff
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
convicts
the
socalled
criminals
could
be
divided
into
five
classes
the
first
were
quite
innocent
people
condemned
by
judicial
blunder
such
were
the
menshoffs
supposed
to
be
incendiaries
maslova
and
others
there
were
not
many
of
these
according
to
the
priests
words
only
seven
per
cent
but
their
condition
excited
particular
interest
to
the
second
class
belong
persons
condemned
for
actions
done
under
peculiar
circumstances
ie
in
a
fit
of
passion
jealousy
or
drunkenness
circumstances
under
which
those
who
judged
them
would
surely
have
committed
the
same
actions
the
third
class
consisted
of
people
punished
for
having
committed
actions
which
according
to
their
understanding
were
quite
natural
and
even
good
but
which
those
other
people
the
men
who
made
the
laws
considered
to
be
crimes
such
were
the
persons
who
sold
spirits
without
a
license
smugglers
those
who
gathered
grass
and
wood
on
large
estates
and
in
the
forests
belonging
to
the
crown
the
thieving
miners
and
those
unbelieving
people
who
robbed
churches
to
the
fourth
class
belonged
those
who
were
imprisoned
only
because
they
stood
morally
higher
than
the
average
level
of
society
such
were
the
sectarians
the
poles
the
circassians
rebelling
in
order
to
regain
their
independence
the
political
prisoners
the
socialists
the
strikers
condemned
for
withstanding
the
authorities
there
was
according
to
nekhludoffs
observations
a
very
large
percentage
belonging
to
this
class
among
them
some
of
the
best
of
men
the
fifth
class
consisted
of
persons
who
had
been
far
more
sinned
against
by
society
than
they
had
sinned
against
it
these
were
castaways
stupefied
by
continual
oppression
and
temptation
such
as
the
boy
who
had
stolen
the
rugs
and
hundreds
of
others
whom
nekhludoff
had
seen
in
the
prison
and
out
of
it
the
conditions
under
which
they
lived
seemed
to
lead
on
systematically
to
those
actions
which
are
termed
crimes
a
great
many
thieves
and
murderers
with
whom
he
had
lately
come
in
contact
according
to
nekhludoffs
estimate
belonged
to
this
class
to
this
class
nekhludoff
also
reckoned
those
depraved
demoralised
creatures
whom
the
new
school
of
criminology
classify
as
the
criminal
type
and
the
existence
of
which
is
considered
to
be
the
chief
proof
of
the
necessity
of
criminal
law
and
punishment
this
demoralised
depraved
abnormal
type
was
according
to
nekhludoff
exactly
the
same
as
that
against
whom
society
had
sinned
only
here
society
had
sinned
not
directly
against
them
but
against
their
parents
and
forefathers
among
this
latter
class
nekhludoff
was
specially
struck
by
one
okhotin
an
inveterate
thief
the
illegitimate
son
of
a
prostitute
brought
up
in
a
dosshouse
who
up
to
the
age
of
30
had
apparently
never
met
with
any
one
whose
morality
was
above
that
of
a
policeman
and
who
had
got
into
a
band
of
thieves
when
quite
young
he
was
gifted
with
an
extraordinary
sense
of
humour
by
means
of
which
he
made
himself
very
attractive
he
asked
nekhludoff
for
protection
at
the
same
time
making
fun
of
himself
the
lawyers
the
prison
and
laws
human
and
divine
another
was
the
handsome
fedoroff
who
with
a
band
of
robbers
of
whom
he
was
the
chief
had
robbed
and
murdered
an
old
man
an
official
fedoroff
was
a
peasant
whose
father
had
been
unlawfully
deprived
of
his
house
and
who
later
on
when
serving
as
a
soldier
had
suffered
much
because
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
an
officers
mistress
he
had
a
fascinating
passionate
nature
that
longed
for
enjoyment
at
any
cost
he
had
never
met
anybody
who
restrained
himself
for
any
cause
whatever
and
had
never
heard
a
word
about
any
aim
in
life
other
than
enjoyment
nekhludoff
distinctly
saw
that
both
these
men
were
richly
endowed
by
nature
but
had
been
neglected
and
crippled
like
uncaredfor
plants
he
had
also
met
a
tramp
and
a
woman
who
had
repelled
him
by
their
dulness
and
seeming
cruelty
but
even
in
them
he
could
find
no
trace
of
the
criminal
type
written
about
by
the
italian
school
but
only
saw
in
them
people
who
were
repulsive
to
him
personally
just
in
the
same
way
as
some
he
had
met
outside
the
prison
in
swallowtail
coats
wearing
epaulettes
or
bedecked
with
lace
and
so
the
investigation
of
the
reasons
why
all
these
very
different
persons
were
put
in
prison
while
others
just
like
them
were
going
about
free
and
even
judging
them
formed
a
fourth
task
for
nekhludoff
he
hoped
to
find
an
answer
to
this
question
in
books
and
bought
all
that
referred
to
it
he
got
the
works
of
lombroso
garofalo
ferry
list
maudsley
tard
and
read
them
carefully
but
as
he
read
he
became
more
and
more
disappointed
it
happened
to
him
as
it
always
happens
to
those
who
turn
to
science
not
in
order
to
play
a
part
in
it
nor
to
write
nor
to
dispute
nor
to
teach
but
simply
for
an
answer
to
an
everyday
question
of
life
science
answered
thousands
of
different
very
subtle
and
ingenious
questions
touching
criminal
law
but
not
the
one
he
was
trying
to
solve
he
asked
a
very
simple
question
why
and
with
what
right
do
some
people
lock
up
torment
exile
flog
and
kill
others
while
they
are
themselves
just
like
those
whom
they
torment
flog
and
kill
and
in
answer
he
got
deliberations
as
to
whether
human
beings
had
free
will
or
not
whether
signs
of
criminality
could
be
detected
by
measuring
the
skulls
or
not
what
part
heredity
played
in
crime
whether
immorality
could
be
inherited
what
madness
is
what
degeneration
is
and
what
temperament
is
how
climate
food
ignorance
imitativeness
hypnotism
or
passion
act
what
society
is
what
are
its
duties
etc
etc
these
disquisitions
reminded
him
of
the
answer
he
once
got
from
a
little
boy
whom
he
met
coming
home
from
school
nekhludoff
asked
him
if
he
had
learned
his
spelling
i
have
answered
the
boy
well
then
tell
me
how
do
you
spell
leg
a
dogs
leg
or
what
kind
of
leg
the
boy
answered
with
a
sly
look
answers
in
the
form
of
new
questions
like
the
boys
was
all
nekhludoff
got
in
reply
to
his
one
primary
question
he
found
much
that
was
clever
learned
much
that
was
interesting
but
what
he
did
not
find
was
an
answer
to
the
principal
question
by
what
right
some
people
punish
others
not
only
did
he
not
find
any
answer
but
all
the
arguments
were
brought
forward
in
order
to
explain
and
vindicate
punishment
the
necessity
of
which
was
taken
as
an
axiom
nekhludoff
read
much
but
only
in
snatches
and
putting
down
his
failure
to
this
superficial
way
of
reading
hoped
to
find
the
answer
later
on
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
believe
in
the
truth
of
the
answer
which
began
more
and
more
often
to
present
itself
to
him

those
aspirations
towards
moral
perfection
and
the
service
of
mankind
which
once
constituted
her
life

put
them
down

towards
liberalism

to
which
best
suited
his
purpose
he
managed

brilliant

he
was
no
longer
in

first
youth
while
travelling
abroad
he
made

no

he

it

his

nekhludoff
had
a
strong
antipathy
towards
him
because
of
the
vulgarity
of
his
feelings
his
assurance
and
narrowness

chiefly
because
of
nathalie
who
managed
to
love
him
in
spite
of
the
narrowness
of
his
nature
and
loved
him
so
selfishly
so
sensually
and
stifled
for
his
sake
all
the
good
that
had
been
in
her
it
always
hurt
nekhludoff
to
think
of
nathalie
as
the
wife
of
that
hairy
selfassured
man
with
the
shiny
bald
patch
on
his
head
he
could
not
even
master
a
feeling
of
revulsion
towards
their
children
and
when
he
heard
that
she
was
again
going
to
have
a
baby
he
felt
something
like
sorrow
that
she
had
once
more
been
infected
with
something
bad
by
this

nathalie
at
once
went
to
her
mothers

but
hearing
from
agraphena

that
her
brother
had
left
and
was
living
in
a
lodginghouse
she
drove
there
the
dirty
servant
met
her
in
the
stuffy
passage
dark
but
for
a
lamp
which
burnt
there
all
day
he
told
her
that
the
prince
was
not
in
nathalie
asked
to
be
shown
into
his
rooms
as
she
wished
to
leave
a
note
for
him
and
the
man
took
her
up
nathalie
carefully
examined
her
brothers
two
little
rooms
she
noticed
in
everything
the
love
of
cleanliness
and
order
she
knew
so
well
in
him
and
was
struck
by
the
novel
simplicity
of
the
surroundings
on
his
writingtable
she
saw
the
paperweight
with
the
bronze
dog
on
the
top
which
she
remembered
the
tidy
way
in
which
his
different
portfolios
and
writing
utensils
were
placed
on
the
table
was
also
familiar
and
so
was
the
large
crooked
ivory
paper
knife
which
marked
the
place
in
a
french
book
by
tard
which
lay
with
other
volumes
on
punishment
and
a
book
in
english
by
henry
george
she
sat
down
at
the
table
and
wrote
a
note
asking
him
to
be
sure
to
come
that
same
day
and
shaking
her
head
in
surprise
at
what
she
saw
she
returned
to
her
hotel
two
questions
regarding
her
brother
now
interested
nathalie
his
marriage
with
katusha
which
she
had
heard
spoken
about
in
their
townfor
everybody
was
speaking
about
itand
his
giving
away
the
land
to
the
peasants
which
was
also
known
and
struck
many
as
something
of
a
political
nature
and
dangerous
the
marriage
with
katusha
pleased
her
in
a
way
she
admired
that
resoluteness
which
was
so
like
him
and
herself
as
they
used
to
be
in
those
happy
times
before
her
marriage
and
yet
she
was
horrified
when
she
thought
her
brother
was
going
to
marry
such
a
dreadful
woman
the
latter
was
the
stronger
feeling
of
the
two
and
she
decided
to
use
all
her
influence
to
prevent
him
from
doing
it
though
she
knew
how
difficult
this
would
be
the
other
matter
the
giving
up
of
the
land
to
the
peasants
did
not
touch
her
so
nearly
but
her
husband
was
very
indignant
about
it
and
expected
her
to
influence
her
brother
against
it
rogozhinsky
said
that
such
an
action
was
the
height
of
inconsistency
flightiness
and
pride
the
only
possible
explanation
of
which
was
the
desire
to
appear
original
to
brag
to
make
ones
self
talked
about
what
sense
could
there
be
in
letting
the
land
to
the
peasants
on
condition
that
they
pay
the
rent
to
themselves
he
said
if
he
was
resolved
to
do
such
a
thing
why
not
sell
the
land
to
them
through
the
peasants
bank
there
might
have
been
some
sense
in
that
in
fact
this
act
verges
on
insanity
and
rogozhinsky
began
seriously
thinking
about
putting
nekhludoff
under
guardianship
and
demanded
of
his
wife
that
she
should
speak
seriously
to
her
brother
about
his
curious
intention

soon
as

returned
that
evening
and
saw
his

on
the
table
he
started
to
go
and
see
her
he
found
nathalie
alone
her
husband
having
gone
to
take
a
rest
in
the
next
room
she
wore
a
tightlyfitting
black
silk
dress
with
a
red
bow
in
front
her
black
hair
was
crimped
and
arranged
according
to
the
latest
fashion
the
pains
she
took
to
appear
young
for
the
sake
of
her
husband
whose
equal
she
was
in
years
were
very
obvious
when
she
saw
her
brother
she
jumped
up
and
hurried
towards
him
with
her
silk
dress
rustling
they
kissed
and
looked
smilingly
at
each
other
there
passed
between
them
that
mysterious
exchange
of
looks
full
of
meaning
in
which
all
was
true
and
which
cannot
be
expressed
in
words
then
came
words
which
were
not
true
they
had
not
met
since
their
mothers
death
you
have
grown
stouter
and
younger
he
said
and
her
lips
puckered
up
with
pleasure
and
you
have
grown
thinner
well
and
how
is
your
husband
nekhludoff
asked
he
is
taking
a
rest
he
did
not
sleep
all
night
there
was
much
to
say
but
it
was
not
said
in
words
only
their
looks
expressed
what
their
words
failed
to
say
i
went
to
see
you
yes
i
know
i
moved
because
the
house
is
too
big
for
me
i
was
lonely
there
and
dull
i
want
nothing
of
all
that
is
there
so
that
you
had
better
take
it
allthe
furniture
i
mean
and
things
yes
agraphena
petrovna
told
me
i
went
there
thanks
very
much
but
at
this
moment
the
hotel
waiter
brought
in
a
silver
teaset
while
he
set
the
table
they
were
silent
then
nathalie
sat
down
at
the
table
and
made
the
tea
still
in
silence
nekhludoff
also
said
nothing
at
last
nathalie
began
resolutely
well
dmitri
i
know
all
about
it
and
she
looked
at
him
what
of
that
l

you
know
how
can
you
hope
to
reform

the
life

has
led

asked
he
sat
quite
straight
on
a
small
chair
and
listened
attentively
trying
to
understand
her
and
to
answer
rightly
the
state
of
mind
called
forth
in
him
by
his
last
interview
with
maslova
still
filled
his
soul
with
quiet
joy
and
good
will
to
all
men
it
is
not
her
but
myself
i
wish
to
reform
he
replied
nathalie
sighed
there
are
other
means
besides
marriage
to
do
that
but
i
think
it
is
the
best
besides
it
leads
me
into
that
world
in
which
i
can
be
of
use
i
cannot
believe
you
will
be
happy
said
nathalie
its
not
my
happiness
that
is
the
point
of
course
but
if
she
has
a
heart
she
cannot
be
happycannot
even
wish
it
she
does
not
wish
it
i
understand
but
life
yeslife
demands
something
different
it
demands
nothing
but
that
we
should
do
what
is
right
said
nekhludoff
looking
into
her
face
still
handsome
though
slightly
wrinkled
round
eyes
and
mouth
i
do
not
understand
she
said
and
sighed
poor
darling
how
could
she
change
so
he
thought
calling
back
to
his
mind
nathalie
as
she
had
been
before
her
marriage
and
feeling
towards
her
a
tenderness
woven
out
of
innumerable
memories
of
childhood
at
that
moment
rogozhinsky
entered
the
room
with
head
thrown
back
and
expanded
chest
and
stepping
lightly
and
softly
in
his
usual
manner
his
spectacles
his
bald
patch
and
his
black
beard
all
glistening
how
do
you
do
how
do
you
do
he
said
laying
an
unnatural
and
intentional
stress
on
his
words
though
soon
after
the
marriage
they
had
tried
to
be
more
familiar
with
each
other
they
had
never
succeeded
they
shook
hands
and
rogozhinsky
sank
softly
into
an
easychair
am
i
not
interrupting
your
conversation
no
i
do
not
wish
to
hide
what
i
am
saying
or
doing
from
any
one
as
soon
as
nekhludoff
saw
the
hairy
hands
and
heard
the
patronising
selfassured
tones
his
meekness
left
him
in
a
moment
yes
we
were
talking
about
his
intentions
said
nathalie
shall
i
give
you
a
cup
of
tea
she
added
taking
the
teapot
yes
please
what
particular
intentions
do
you
mean
that
of
going
to
siberia
with
the
gang
of
prisoners
among
whom
is
the
woman
i
consider
myself
to
have
wronged
uttered
nekhludoff
i
hear
not
only
to
accompany
her
but
more
than
that
yes
and
to
marry
her
if
she
wishes
it
dear
me
but
if
you
do
not
object
i
should
like
to
ask
you
to
explain
your
motives
i
do
not
understand
them
my
motives
are
that
this
womanthat
this
womans
first
step
on
her
way
to
degradation
nekhludoff
got
angry
with
himself
and
was
unable
to
find
the
right
expression
my
motives
are
that
i
am
the
guilty
one
and
she
gets
the
punishment
if
she
is
being
punished
she
cannot
be
innocent
either
she
is
quite
innocent
and
nekhludoff
related
the
whole
incident
with
unnecessary
warmth
yes
that
was
a
case
of
carelessness
on
the
part
of
the
president
the
result
of
which
was
a
thoughtless
answer
on
the
part
of
the
jury
but
there
is
the
senate
for
cases
like
that
the
senate
has
rejected
the
appeal
well
if
the
senate
has
rejected
it
there
cannot
have
been
sufficient
reasons
for
an
appeal
said
rogozhinsky
evidently
sharing
the
prevailing
opinion
that
truth
is
the
product
of
judicial
decrees
the
senate
cannot
enter
into
the
question
on
its
merits
if
there
is
a
real
mistake
the
emperor
should
be
petitioned
that
has
been
done
but
there
is
no
probability
of
success
they
will
apply
to
the
department
of
the
ministry
the
department
will
consult
the
senate
the
senate
will
repeat
its
decision
and
as
usual
the
innocent
will
get
punished
in
the
first
place
the
department
of
the
ministry
wont
consult
the
senate
said
rogozhinsky
with
a
condescending
smile
it
will
give
orders
for
the
original
deeds
to
be
sent
from
the
law
court
and
if
it
discovers
a
mistake
it
will
decide
accordingly
and
secondly
the
innocent
are
never
punished
or
at
least
in
very
rare
exceptional
cases
it
is
the
guilty
who
are
punished
rogozhinsky
said
deliberately
and
smiled
selfcomplacently
and
i
have
become
fully
convinced
that
most
of
those
condemned
by
law
are
innocent
hows
that
innocent
in
the
literal
sense
just
as
this
woman
is
innocent
of
poisoning
any
one
as
innocent
as
a
peasant
i
have
just
come
to
know
of
the
murder
he
never
committed
as
a
mother
and
son
who
were
on
the
point
of
being
condemned
for
incendiarism
which
was
committed
by
the
owner
of
the
house
that
was
set
on
fire
well
of
course
there
always
have
been
and
always
will
be
judicial
errors
human
institutions
cannot
be
perfect
and
besides
there
are
a
great
many
people
convicted
who
are
innocent
of
doing
anything
considered
wrong
by
the
society
they
have
grown
up
in
excuse
me
this
is
not
so
every
thief
knows
that
stealing
is
wrong
and
that
we
should
not
steal
that
it
is
immoral
said
rogozhinsky
with
his
quiet
selfassured
slightly
contemptuous
smile
which
specially
irritated
nekhludoff
no
he
does
not
know
it
they
say
to
him
dont
steal
and
he
knows
that
the
master
of
the
factory
steals
his
labour
by
keeping
back
his
wages
that
the
government
with
its
officials
robs
him
continually
by
taxation
why
this
is
anarchism
rogozhinsky
said
quietly
defining
his
brotherinlaws
words
i
dont
know
what
it
is
i
am
only
telling
you
the
truth
nekhludoff
continued
he
knows
that
the
government
is
robbing
him
knows
that
we
landed
proprietors
have
robbed
him
long
since
robbed
him
of
the
land
which
should
be
the
common
property
of
all
and
then
if
he
picks
up
dry
wood
to
light
his
fire
on
that
land
stolen
from
him
we
put
him
in
jail
and
try
to
persuade
him
that
he
is
a
thief
of
course
he
knows
that
not
he
but
those
who
robbed
him
of
the
land
are
thieves
and
that
to
get
any
restitution
of
what
has
been
robbed
is
his
duty
towards
his
family
i
dont
understand
or
if
i
do
i
cannot
agree
with
it
the
land
must
be
somebodys
property
began
rogozhinsky
quietly
and
convinced
that
nekhludoff
was
a
socialist
and
that
socialism
demands
that
all
the
land
should
be
divided
equally
that
such
a
division
would
be
very
foolish
and
that
he
could
easily
prove
it
to
be
so
he
said
if
you
divided
it
equally
today
it
would
tomorrow
be
again
in
the
hands
of
the
most
industrious
and
clever
nobody
is
thinking
of
dividing
the
land
equally
the
land
must
not
be
anybodys
property
must
not
be
a
thing
to
be
bought
and
sold
or
rented
the
rights
of
property
are
inborn
in
man
without
them
the
cultivation
of
land
would
present
no
interest
destroy
the
rights
of
property
and
we
lapse
into
barbarism
rogozhinsky
uttered
this
authoritatively
repeating
the
usual
argument
in
favour
of
private
ownership
of
land
which
is
supposed
to
be
irrefutable
based
on
the
assumption
that
peoples
desire
to
possess
land
proves
that
they
need
it
on
the
contrary
only
when
the
land
is
nobodys
property
will
it
cease
to
lie
idle
as
it
does
now
while
the
landlords
like
dogs
in
the
manger
unable
themselves
to
put
it
to
use
will
not
let
those
use
it
who
are
able
but
dmitri
ivanovitch
what
you
are
saying
is
sheer
madness
is
it
possible
to
abolish
property
in
land
in
our
age
i
know
it
is
your
old
hobby
but
allow
me
to
tell
you
straight
and
rogozhinsky
grew
pale
and
his
voice
trembled
it
was
evident
that
this
question
touched
him
very
nearly
i
should
advise
you
to
consider
this
question
well
before
attempting
to
solve
it
practically
are
you
speaking
of
my
personal
affairs
yes
i
hold
that
we
who
are
placed
in
special
circumstances
should
bear
the
responsibilities
which
spring
from
those
circumstances
should
uphold
the
conditions
in
which
we
were
born
and
which
we
have
inherited
from
our
predecessors
and
which
we
ought
to
pass
on
to
our
descendants
i
consider
it
my
duty
wait
a
bit
said
rogozhinsky
not
permitting
the
interruption
i
am
not
speaking
for
myself
or
my
children
the
position
of
my
children
is
assured
and
i
earn
enough
for
us
to
live
comfortably
and
i
expect
my
children
will
live
so
too
so
that
my
interest
in
your
actionwhich
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
is
not
well
consideredis
not
based
on
personal
motives
it
is
on
principle
that
i
cannot
agree
with
you
i
should
advise
you
to
think
it
well
over
to
read
please
allow
me
to
settle
my
affairs
and
to
choose
what
to
read
and
what
not
to
read
myself
said
nekhludoff
turning
pale
feeling
his
hands
grow
cold
and
that
he
was
no
longer
master
of
himself
he
stopped
and
began
drinking
his
tea
chapter
xxxiii
the
aim
of
the
law
well
and
how
are
the
children
nekhludoff
asked
his
sister
when
he
was
calmer
the
sister
told
him
about
the
children
she
said
they
were
staying
with
their
grandmother
their
fathers
mother
and
pleased
that
his
dispute
with
her
husband
had
come
to
an
end
she
began
telling
him
how
her
children
played
that
they
were
travelling
just
as
he
used
to
do
with
his
three
dolls
one
of
them
a
negro
and
another
which
he
called
the
french
lady
can
you
really
remember
it
all
said
nekhludoff
smiling
yes
and
just
fancy
they
play
in
the
very
same
way
the
unpleasant
conversation
had
been
brought
to
an
end
and
nathalie
was
quieter
but
she
did
not
care
to
talk
in
her
husbands
presence
of
what
could
be
comprehensible
only
to
her
brother
so
wishing
to
start
a
general
conversation
she
began
talking
about
the
sorrow
of
kamenskis
mother
at
losing
her
only
son
who
had
fallen
in
a
duel
for
this
petersburg
topic
of
the
day
had
now
reached
moscow
rogozhinsky
expressed
disapproval
at
the
state
of
things
that
excluded
murder
in
a
duel
from
the
ordinary
criminal
offences
this
remark
evoked
a
rejoinder
from
nekhludoff
and
a
new
dispute
arose
on
the
subject
nothing
was
fully
explained
neither
of
the
antagonists
expressed
all
he
had
in
his
mind
each
keeping
to
his
conviction
which
condemned
the
other
rogozhinsky
felt
that
nekhludoff
condemned
him
and
despised
his
activity
and
he
wished
to
show
him
the
injustice
of
his
opinions
nekhludoff
on
the
other
hand
felt
provoked
by
his
brotherinlaws
interference
in
his
affairs
concerning
the
land
and
knowing
in
his
heart
of
hearts
that
his
sister
her
husband
and
their
children
as
his
heirs
had
a
right
to
do
so
was
indignant
that
this
narrowminded
man
persisted
with
calm
assurance
to
regard
as
just
and
lawful
what
nekhludoff
no
longer
doubted
was
folly
and
crime
this
mans
arrogance
annoyed
nekhludoff
what
could
the
law
do
he
asked
it
could
sentence
one
of
the
two
duellists
to
the
mines
like
an
ordinary
murderer
nekhludoffs
hands
grew
cold
well
and
what
good
would
that
be
he
asked
hotly
it
would
be
just
as
if
justice
were
the
aim
of
the
law
said
nekhludoff
what
else
the
upholding
of
class
interests
i
think
the
law
is
only
an
instrument
for
upholding
the
existing
order
of
things
beneficial
to
our
class
this
is
a
perfectly
new
view
said
rogozhinsky
with
a
quiet
smile
the
law
is
generally
supposed
to
have
a
totally
different
aim
yes
so
it
has
in
theory
but
not
in
practice
as
i
have
found
out
the
law
aims
only
at
preserving
the
present
state
of
things
and
therefore
it
persecutes
and
executes
those
who
stand
above
the
ordinary
level
and
wish
to
raise
itthe
socalled
political
prisoners
as
well
as
those
who
are
below
the
averagethe
socalled
criminal
types
i
do
not
agree
with
you
in
the
first
place
i
cannot
admit
that
the
criminals
classed
as
political
are
punished
because
they
are
above
the
average
in
most
cases
they
are
the
refuse
of
society
just
as
much
perverted
though
in
a
different
way
as
the
criminal
types
whom
you
consider
below
the
average
but
i
happen
to
know
men
who
are
morally
far
above
their
judges
all
the
sectarians
are
moral
from
but
rogozhinsky
a
man
not
accustomed
to
be
interrupted
when
he
spoke
did
not
listen
to
nekhludoff
but
went
on
talking
at
the
same
time
thereby
irritating
him
still
more
nor
can
i
admit
that
the
object
of
the
law
is
the
upholding
of
the
present
state
of
things
the
law
aims
at
reforming
a
nice
kind
of
reform
in
a
prison
nekhludoff
put
in
or
removing
rogozhinsky
went
on
persistently
the
perverted
and
brutalised
persons
that
threaten
society
thats
just
what
it
doesnt
do
society
has
not
the
means
of
doing
either
the
one
thing
or
the
other
how
is
that
i
dont
understand
said
rogozhinsky
with
a
forced
smile
i
mean
that
only
two
reasonable
kinds
of
punishment
exist
those
used
in
the
old
days
corporal
and
capital
punishment
which
as
human
nature
gradually
softens
come
more
and
more
into
disuse
said
nekhludoff
there
now
this
is
quite
new
and
very
strange
to
hear
from
your
lips
yes
it
is
reasonable
to
hurt
a
man
so
that
he
should
not
do
in
future
what
he
is
hurt
for
doing
and
it
is
also
quite
reasonable
to
cut
a
mans
head
off
when
he
is
injurious
or
dangerous
to
society
these
punishments
have
a
reasonable
meaning
but
what
sense
is
there
in
locking
up
in
a
prison
a
man
perverted
by
want
of
occupation
and
bad
example
to
place
him
in
a
position
where
he
is
provided
for
where
laziness
is
imposed
on
him
and
where
he
is
in
company
with
the
most
perverted
of
men
what
reason
is
there
to
take
a
man
at
public
cost
it
comes
to
more
than
500
roubles
per
head
from
the
toula
to
the
irkoatsk
government
or
from
koursk
yes
but
all
the
same
people
are
afraid
of
those
journeys
at
public
cost
and
if
it
were
not
for
such
journeys
and
the
prisons
you
and
i
would
not
be
sitting
here
as
we
are
the
prisons
cannot
insure
our
safety
because
these
people
do
not
stay
there
for
ever
but
are
set
free
again
on
the
contrary
in
those
establishments
men
are
brought
to
the
greatest
vice
and
degradation
so
that
the
danger
is
increased
you
mean
to
say
that
the
penitentiary
system
should
be
improved
it
cannot
be
improved
improved
prisons
would
cost
more
than
all
that
is
being
now
spent
on
the
peoples
education
and
would
lay
a
still
heavier
burden
on
the
people
the
shortcomings
of
the
penitentiary
system
in
nowise
invalidate
the
law
itself
rogozhinsky
continued
again
without
heeding
his
brotherinlaw
there
is
no
remedy
for
these
shortcomings
said
nekhludoff
raising
his
voice
what
of
that
shall
we
therefore
go
and
kill
or
as
a
certain
statesman
proposed
go
putting
out
peoples
eyes
rogozhinsky
remarked
yes
that
would
be
cruel
but
it
would
be
effective
what
is
done
now
is
cruel
and
not
only
ineffective
but
so
stupid
that
one
cannot
understand
how
people
in
their
senses
can
take
part
in
so
absurd
and
cruel
a
business
as
criminal
law
but
i
happen
to
take
part
in
it
said
rogozhinsky
growing
pale
that
is
your
business
but
to
me
it
is
incomprehensible
i
think
there
are
a
good
many
things
incomprehensible
to
you
said
rogozhinsky
with
a
trembling
voice
i
have
seen
how
one
public
prosecutor
did
his
very
best
to
get
an
unfortunate
boy
condemned
who
could
have
evoked
nothing
but
sympathy
in
an
unperverted
mind
i
know
how
another
crossexamined
a
sectarian
and
put
down
the
reading
of
the
gospels
as
a
criminal
offence
in
fact
the
whole
business
of
the
law
courts
consists
in
senseless
and
cruel
actions
of
that
sort
i
should
not
serve
if
i
thought
so
said
rogozhinsky
rising
nekhludoff
noticed
a
peculiar
glitter
under
his
brotherinlaws
spectacles
can
it
be
tears
he
thought
and
they
were
really
tears
of
injured
pride
rogozhinsky
went
up
to
the
window
got
out
his
handkerchief
coughed
and
rubbed
his
spectacles
took
them
off
and
wiped
his
eyes
when
he
returned
to
the
sofa
he
lit
a
cigar
and
did
not
speak
any
more
nekhludoff
felt
pained
and
ashamed
of
having
offended
his
brotherinlaw
and
his
sister
to
such
a
degree
especially
as
he
was
going
away
the
next
day
he
parted
with
them
in
confusion
and
drove
home
all
i
have
said
may
be
trueanyhow
he
did
not
reply
but
it
was
not
said
in
the
right
way
how
little
i
must
have
changed
if
i
could
be
carried
away
by
illfeeling
to
such
an
extent
as
to

at
3

to

the

the
prisoners
nekhludoff
meant
to
reach
the
prison
before
12
oclock
the
night
before
as
he
was
packing
up
and
sorting
his
papers
he
came
upon
his
diary
and
read
some
bits
here
and
there
the
last
bit
written
before
he
left
for
petersburg
ran
thus
katusha
does
not
wish
to
accept
my
sacrifice
she
wishes
to
make
a
sacrifice
herself
she
has
conquered
and
so
have
i
she
makes
me
happy
by
the
inner
change
which
seems
to
me
though
i
fear
to
believe
it
to
be
going
on
in
her
i
fear
to
believe
it
yet
she
seems
to
be
coming
back
to
life
then
further
on
he
read
i
have
lived
through
something
very
hard
and
very
joyful
i
learnt
that
she
has
behaved
very
badly
in
the
hospital
and
i
suddenly
felt
great
pain
i
never
expected
that
it
could
be
so
painful
i
spoke
to
her
with
loathing
and
hatred
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
called
to
mind
how
many
times
i
have
been
and
even
still
am
though
but
in
thought
guilty
of
the
thing
that
i
hated
her
for
and
immediately
i
became
disgusting
to
myself
and
pitied
her
and
felt
happy
again
if
only
we
could
manage
to
see
the
beam
in
our
own
eye
in
time
how
kind
we
should
be
then
he
wrote
i
have
been
to
see
nathalie
and
again
selfsatisfaction
made
me
unkind
and
spiteful
and
a
heavy
feeling
remains
well
what
is
to
be
done
tomorrow
a
new
life
will
begin
a
final
goodbye
to
the
old
many
new
impressions
have
accumulated
but
i
cannot
yet
bring
them
to
unity
when
he
awoke
the
next
morning
nekhludoffs
first
feeling
was
regret
about
the
affair
between
him
and
his
brotherinlaw
i
cannot
go
away
like
this
he
thought
i
must
go
and
make
it
up
with
them
but
when
he
looked
at
his
watch
he
saw
that
he
had
not
time
to
go
but
must
hurry
so
as
not
to
be
too
late
for
the
departure
of
the
gang
he
hastily
got
everything
ready
and
sent
the
things
to
the
station
with
a
servant
and
taras
theodosias
husband
who
was
going
with
them
then
he
took
the
first
isvostchik
he
could
find
and
drove
off
to
the
prison
the
prisoners
train
started
two
hours
before
the
train
by
which
he
was
going
so
nekhludoff
paid
his
bill
in
the
lodgings
and
left
for
good
it
was
july
and
the
weather
was
unbearably
hot
from
the
stones
the
walls
the
iron
of
the
roofs
which
the
sultry
night
had
not
cooled
the
heat
streamed
into
the
motionless
air
when
at
rare
intervals
a
slight
breeze
did
arise
it
brought
but
a
whiff
of
hot
air
filled
with
dust
and
smelling
of
oil
paint
there
were
few
people
in
the
streets
and
those
who
were
out
tried
to
keep
on
the
shady
side
only
the
sunburnt
peasants
with
their
bronzed
faces
and
bark
shoes
on
their
feet
who
were
mending
the
road
sat
hammering
the
stones
into
the
burning
sand
in
the
sun
while
the
policemen
in
their
holland
blouses
with
revolvers
fastened
with
orange
cords
stood
melancholy
and
depressed
in
the
middle
of
the
road
changing
from
foot
to
foot
and
the
tramcars
the
horses
of
which
wore
holland
hoods
on
their
heads
with
slits
for
the
ears
kept
passing
up
and
down
the
sunny
road
with
ringing
bells
when
nekhludoff
drove
up
to
the
prison
the
gang
had
not
left
the
yard
the
work
of
delivering
and
receiving
the
prisoners
that
had
commenced
at
4
am

still
going
on
the
gang

to
consist
of
623
men
and
64
women
they
had
all
to
be
received
according
to
the
registry
lists
the
sick
and
the
weak
to
be
sorted
out
and
all
to
be
delivered
to
the
convoy
the
new
inspector
with
two
assistants
the
doctor
and
medical
assistant
the
officer
of
the
convoy
and
the
clerk
were
sitting
in
the
prison
yard
at
a
table
covered
with
writing
materials
and
papers
which
was
placed
in
the
shade
of
a
wall
they
called
the
prisoners
one
by
one
examined
and
questioned
them
and
took
notes
the
rays
of
the
sun
had
gradually
reached
the
table
and
it
was
growing
very
hot
and
oppressive
for
want
of
air
and
because
of
the
breathing
crowd
of
prisoners
that
stood
close
by
good
gracious
will
this
never
come
to
an
end
the
convoy
officer
a
tall
fat
redfaced
man
with
high
shoulders
who
kept
puffing
the
smoke
of
his
cigarette
into
his
thick
moustache
asked
as
he
drew
in
a
long
puff
you
are
killing
me
from
where
have
you
got
them
all
are
there
many
more
the
clerk
inquired
twentyfour
men
and
the
women
what
are
you
standing
there
for
come
on
shouted
the
convoy
officer
to
the
prisoners
who
had
not
yet
passed
the
revision
and
who
stood
crowded
one
behind
the
other
the
prisoners
had
been
standing
there
more
than
three
hours
packed
in
rows
in
the
full
sunlight
waiting
their
turns
while
this
was
going
on
in
the
prison
yard
outside
the
gate
besides
the
sentinel
who
stood
there
as
usual
with
a
gun
were
drawn
up
about
20
carts
to
carry
the
luggage
of
the
prisoners
and
such
prisoners
as
were
too
weak
to
walk
and
a
group
of
relatives
and
friends
waiting
to
see
the
prisoners
as
they
came
out
and
to
exchange
a
few
words
if
a
chance
presented
itself
and
to
give
them
a
few
things
nekhludoff
took
his
place
among
the
group
he
had
stood
there
about
an
hour
when
the
clanking
of
chains
the
noise
of
footsteps
authoritative
voices
the
sound
of
coughing
and
the
low
murmur
of
a
large
crowd
became
audible
this
continued
for
about
five
minutes
during
which
several
jailers
went
in
and
out
of
the
gateway
at
last
the
word
of
command
was
given
the
gate
opened
with
a
thundering
noise
the
clattering
of
the
chains
became
louder
and
the
convoy
soldiers
dressed
in
white
blouses
and
carrying
guns
came
out
into
the
street
and
took
their
places
in
a
large
exact
circle
in
front
of
the
gate
this
was
evidently
a
usual
oftenpractised
manoeuvre
then
another
command
was
given
and
the
prisoners
began
coming
out
in
couples
with
flat
pancakeshaped
caps
on
their
shaved
heads
and
sacks
over
their
shoulders
dragging
their
chained
legs
and
swinging
one
arm
while
the
other
held
up
a
sack
first
came
the
men
condemned
to
hard
labour
all
dressed
alike
in
grey
trousers
and
cloaks
with

russians

and

out
clattering
with
their
chains
and
briskly
swinging
their
arms
as
if
prepared
to
go
a
long
distance
but
stopped
after
having
taken
ten
steps
and
obediently
took
their
places
behind
each
other
four
abreast
then
without
interval
streamed
out
more
shaved
men

as

were
coming
out
but
she
was
at
once
lost
in
the

and
he
could
only
see
grey
creatures
seemingly
devoid
of
all
that
was
human
or
at
any
rate
of
all
that
was
womanly
with
sacks
on
their
backs
and
children
round
them
taking
their

behind
the

all
the

had
been
counted
inside
the
prison
walls
the
convoy
counted
them
again
comparing
the
numbers
with
the
list
this
took
very
long
especially
as
some
of
the
prisoners
moved
and
changed
places
which
confused
the

the

soldiers
shouted
and
pushed
the

angrily
and
counted
them
over
again
when
all
had
been

the

gave
a

the

the

rushed
racing

found
out
later
that

nekhludoff
saw
how
the
officer
without
looking
at
the
prisoners
drew
in
a
whiff
from
his
cigarette
and
then
suddenly
waved
his
short
arm
in
front
of
one
of
the
prisoners
who
quickly
drew
his
shaved
head
back
between
his
shoulders

afraid

take
off
his

the

was
such
a
long
one
that
the
carts
with
the
luggage
and
the
weak
started
only
when

in

were
already

of

nekhludoff
got
into
the
trap
that
stood
waiting
for
him

told
the
isvostchik
to
catch
up
the
prisoners
in

so
that
he
could
see
if

of

ask
her

very
hot
and
a
cloud
of
dust
that
was
raised
by
a
thousand
tramping
feet
stood
all
the
time
over
the
gang
that
was
moving
down
the
middle
of
the
street
the
prisoners
were
walking
quickly
and
the
slowgoing
isvostchiks
horse
was
some
time
in
catching
them
up
row
upon
row
they
passed
those
strange

terriblelooking
creatures
none
of
whom
nekhludoff
knew
on
they
went
all
dressed
alike
moving
a
thousand
feet
all
shod
alike
swinging
their
free
arms
as
if
to
keep
up
their
spirits
there
were
so
many
of
them
they
all
looked
so
much
alike
and
they
were
all
placed
in
such
unusual
peculiar
circumstances
that
they
seemed
to
nekhludoff
to
be
not
men
but
some
sort
of
strange
and
terrible
creatures
this
impression
passed
when
he
recognised
in
the
crowd
of
convicts
the
murderer
federoff
and
among
the
exiles
okhotin
the
wit
and
another
tramp
who
had
appealed
to
him
for
assistance
almost
all
the
prisoners
turned
and
looked
at
the
trap
that
was
passing
them
and
at
the
gentleman
inside
federoff
tossed
his
head
backwards
as
a
sign
that
he
had
recognised
nekhludoff
okhotin
winked
but
neither
of
them
bowed
considering
it
not
the
thing
as
soon
as
nekhludoff
came
up
to
the
women
he
saw
maslova
she
was
in
the
second
row
the
first
in
the
row
was
a
shortlegged
blackeyed
hideous
woman
who
had
her
cloak
tucked
up
in
her
girdle
this
was
koroshavka
the
next
was
a
pregnant
woman
who
dragged
herself
along
with
difficulty
the
third
was
maslova
she
was
carrying
her
sack
on
her
shoulder
and
looking
straight
before
her
her
face
looked
calm
and
determined
the
fourth
in
the
row
was
a
young
lovely
woman
who
was
walking
along
briskly
dressed
in
a
short
cloak
her
kerchief
tied
in
peasant
fashion
this
was
theodosia
nekhludoff
got
down
and
approached
the
women
meaning
to
ask
maslova
if
she
had
got
the
things
he
had
sent
her
and
how
she
was
feeling
but
the
convoy
sergeant
who
was
walking
on
that
side
noticed
him
at
once
and
ran
towards
him
you
must
not
do
that
sir
it
is
against
the
regulations
to
approach
the
gang
shouted
the
sergeant
as
he
came
up
but
when
he
recognised
nekhludoff
every
one
in
the
prison
knew
nekhludoff
the
sergeant
raised
his
fingers
to
his
cap
and
stopping
in
front
of
nekhludoff
said
not
now
wait
till
we
get
to
the
railway
station
here
it
is
not
allowed
dont
lag
behind

he
shouted
to
the
convicts
and
putting
on
a
brisk
air
he
ran
back
to
his
place
at
a
trot
in
spite
of
the
heat
and
the
elegant
new
boots
on
his
feet
nekhludoff
went
on
to
the
pavement
and
told
the
isvostchik
to
follow
him
himself
walking
so
as
to
keep
the
convicts
in
sight
wherever
the
gang
passed
it
attracted
attention
mixed
with
horror
and
compassion
those
who
drove
past
leaned
out
of
the
vehicles
and
followed
the
prisoners
with
their
eyes
those
on
foot
stopped
and
looked
with
fear
and
surprise
at
the
terrible
sight
some
came
up
and
gave
alms
to
the
prisoners
the
alms
were
received
by
the
convoy
some
as
if
they
were
hypnotised
followed
the
gang
but
then
stopped
shook
their
heads
and
followed
the
prisoners
only
with
their
eyes
everywhere
the
people
came
out
of
the
gates
and
doors
and
called
others
to
come
out
too
or
leaned
out
of
the
windows
looking
silent
and
immovable
at
the
frightful
procession
at
a
crossroad
a
fine
carriage
was
stopped
by
the
gang
a
fat
coachman
with
a
shiny
face
and
two
rows
of
buttons
on
his
back
sat
on
the
box
a
married
couple
sat
facing
the
horses
the
wife
a
pale
thin
woman
with
a
lightcoloured
bonnet
on
her
head
and
a
bright
sunshade
in
her
hand
the
husband
with
a
tophat
and
a
wellcut
lightcoloured
overcoat
on
the
seat
in
front
sat
their
childrena
welldressed
little
girl
with
loose
fair
hair
and
as
fresh
as
a
flower
who
also
held
a
bright
parasol
and
an
eightyearold
boy
with
a
long
thin
neck
and
sharp
collarbones
a
sailor
hat
with
long
ribbons
on
his
head
the
father
was
angrily
scolding
the
coachman
because
he
had
not
passed
in
front
of
the
gang
when
he
had
a
chance
and
the
mother
frowned
and
half
closed
her
eyes
with
a
look
of
disgust
shielding
herself
from
the
dust
and
the
sun
with
her
silk
sunshade
which
she
held
close
to
her
face
the
fat
coachman
frowned
angrily
at
the
unjust
rebukes
of
his
masterwho
had
himself
given
the
order
to
drive
along
that
streetand
with
difficulty
held
in
the
glossy
black
horses
foaming
under
their
harness
and
impatient
to
go
on
the
policeman
wished
with
all
his
soul
to
please
the
owner
of
the
fine
equipage
by
stopping
the
gang
yet
felt
that
the
dismal
solemnity
of
the
procession
could
not
be
broken
even
for
so
rich
a
gentleman
he
only
raised
his
fingers
to
his
cap
to
show
his
respect
for
riches
and
looked
severely
at
the
prisoners
as
if
promising
in
any
case
to
protect
the
owners
of
the
carriage
from
them
so
the
carriage
had
to
wait
till
the
whole
of
the
procession
had
passed
and
could
only
move
on
when
the
last
of
the
carts
laden
with
sacks
and
prisoners
rattled
by
the
hysterical
woman
who
sat
on
one
of
the
carts
and
had
grown
calm
again
began
shrieking
and
sobbing
when
she
saw
the
elegant
carriage
then
the
coachman
tightened
the
reins
with
a
slight
touch
and
the
black
trotters
their
shoes
ringing
against
the
paving
stones
drew
the
carriage
softly
swaying
on
its
rubber
tires
towards
the
country
house
where
the
husband
the
wife
the
girl
and
the
boy
with
the
sharp
collarbones
were
going
to
amuse
themselves
neither
the
father
nor
the
mother
gave
the
girl
and
boy
any
explanation
of
what
they
had
seen
so
that
the
children
had
themselves
to
find
out
the
meaning
of
this
curious
sight
the
girl
taking
the
expression
of
her
fathers
and
mothers
faces
into
consideration
solved
the
problem
by
assuming
that
these
people
were
quite
another
kind
of
men
and
women
than
her
father
and
mother
and
their
acquaintances
that
they
were
bad
people
and
that
they
had
therefore
to
be
treated
in
the
manner
they
were
being
treated
therefore
the
girl
felt
nothing
but
fear
and
was
glad
when
she
could
no
longer
see
those
people
but
the
boy
with
the
long
thin
neck
who
looked
at
the
procession
of
prisoners
without
taking
his
eyes
off
them
solved
the
question
differently
he
still
knew
firmly
and
without
any
doubt
for
he
had
it
from
god
that
these
people
were
just
the
same
kind
of
people
as
he
was
and
like
all
other
people
and
therefore
some
one
had
done
these
people
some
wrong
something
that
ought
not
to
have
been
done
and
he
was
sorry
for
them
and
felt
no
horror
either
of
those
who
were
shaved
and
chained
or
of
those
who
had
shaved
and
chained
them
and
so
the
boys
lips
pouted
more
and
more
and
he
made
greater
and
greater
efforts
not
to
cry
thinking
it
a
shame
to
cry
in
such
a
case

got
into
the
trap
but
it
felt
still
hotter
in
the
middle
of
the
street
he
tried
to
recall
last
nights
conversation
with
his
brotherinlaw
but
the
recollections
no
longer
excited
him
as
they
had
done
in
the
morning
they
were
dulled
by
the
impressions
made
by
the
starting
and
procession
of
the
gang
and
chiefly
by
the
intolerable
heat
on
the
pavement
in
the
shade
of
some
trees
overhanging
a
fence
he
saw
two
schoolboys
standing
over
a
kneeling
man
who
sold
ices
one
of
the
boys
was
already
sucking
a
pink
spoon
and
enjoying
his
ices
the
other
was
waiting
for
a
glass
that
was
being
filled
with
something
yellowish
where
could
i
get
a
drink
nekhludoff
asked
his
isvostchik
feeling
an
insurmountable
desire
for
some
refreshment
there
is
a
good
eatinghouse
close
by
the
isvostchik
answered
and
turning
a
corner
drove
up
to
a
door
with
a
large
signboard
the
plump
clerk
in
a
russian
shirt
who
stood
behind
the
counter
and
the
waiters
in
their
once
white
clothing
who
sat
at
the
tables
there
being
hardly
any
customers
looked
with
curiosity
at
the
unusual
visitor
and
offered
him
their
services
nekhludoff
asked
for
a
bottle
of
seltzer
water
and
sat
down
some
way
from
the
window
at
a
small
table
covered
with
a
dirty
cloth
two
men
sat
at
another
table
with
teathings
and
a
white
bottle
in
front
of
them
mopping
their
foreheads
and
calculating
something
in
a
friendly
manner
one
of
them
was
dark
and
bald
and
had
just
such
a
border
of
hair
at
the
back
as
rogozhinsky
this
sight
again
reminded
nekhludoff
of
yesterdays
talk
with
his
brotherinlaw
and
his
wish
to
see
him
and
nathalie
i
shall
hardly
be
able
to
do
it
before
the
train
starts
he
thought
id
better
write
he
asked
for
paper
an
envelope
and
a
stamp
and
as
he
was
sipping
the
cool
effervescent
water
he
considered
what
he
should
say
but
his
thoughts
wandered
and
he
could
not
manage
to
compose
a
letter
my
dear
nathaliei
cannot
go
away
with
the
heavy
impression
that
yesterdays
talk
with
your
husband
has
left
he
began
what
next
shall
i
ask
him
to
forgive
me
what
i
said
yesterday
but
i
only
said
what
i
felt
and
he
will
think
that
i
am
taking
it
back
besides
this
interference
of
his
in
my
private
matters



no
i
cannot
and
again
he
felt
hatred
rising
in
his
heart
towards
that
man
so
foreign
to
him
he
folded
the
unfinished
letter
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
paid
went
out
and
again
got
into
the
trap
to
catch
up
the
gang
it
had
grown
still
hotter
the
stones
and
the
walls
seemed
to
be
breathing
out
hot
air
the
pavement
seemed
to
scorch
the
feet
and
nekhludoff
felt
a
burning
sensation
in
his
hand
when
he
touched
the
lacquered
splashguard
of
his
trap
the
horse
was
jogging
along
at
a
weary
trot
beating
the
uneven
dusty
road
monotonously
with
its
hoofs
the
isvostchik
kept
falling
into
a
doze
nekhludoff
sat
without
thinking
of
anything
at
the
bottom
of
a
street
in
front
of
a
large
house
a
group
of
people
had
collected
and
a
convoy
soldier
stood
by
what
has
happened
nekhludoff
asked
of
a
porter
something
the
matter
with
a
convict
nekhludoff
got
down
and
came
up
to
the
group
on
the
rough
stones
where
the
pavement
slanted
down
to
the
gutter
lay
a
broadlybuilt
redbearded
elderly
convict
with
his
head
lower
than
his
feet
and
very
red
in
the
face
he
had
a
grey
cloak
and
grey
trousers
on
and
lay
on
his
back
with
the
palms
of
his
freckled
hands
downwards
and
at
long
intervals
his
broad
high
chest
heaved
and
he
groaned
while
his
bloodshot
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
sky
by
him
stood
a
crosslooking
policeman
a
pedlar
a
postman
a
clerk
an
old
woman
with
a
parasol
and
a
shorthaired
boy
with
an
empty
basket
they
are
weak
having
been
locked
up
in
prison
theyve
got
weak
and
then
they
lead
them
through
the
most
broiling
heat
said
the
clerk
addressing
nekhludoff
who
had
just
come
up
hell
die
most
likely
said
the
woman
with
the
parasol
in
a
doleful
tone
his
shirt
should
be
untied
said
the
postman
the
policeman
began
with
his
thick
trembling
fingers
clumsily
to
untie
the
tapes
that
fastened
the
shirt
round
the
red
sinewy
neck
he
was
evidently
excited
and
confused
but
still
thought
it
necessary
to
address
the
crowd
what
have
you
collected
here
for
it
is
hot
enough
without
your
keeping
the
wind
off
they
should
have
been
examined
by
a
doctor
and
the
weak
ones
left
behind
said
the
clerk
showing
off
his
knowledge
of
the
law
the
policeman
having
undone
the
tapes
of
the
shirt
rose
and
looked
round
move
on
i
tell
you
it
is
not
your
business
is
it
whats
there
to
stare
at
he
said
and
turned
to
nekhludoff
for
sympathy
but
not
finding
any
in
his
face
he
turned
to
the
convoy
soldier
but
the
soldier
stood
aside
examining
the
troddendown
heel
of
his
boot
and
was
quite
indifferent
to
the
policemans
perplexity
those
whose
business
it
is
dont
care
is
it
right
to
do
men
to
death
like
this
a
convict
is
a
convict
but
still
he
is
a
man
different
voices
were
heard
saying
in
the
crowd
put
his
head
up
higher
and
give
him
some
water
said
nekhludoff
water
has
been
sent
for
said
the
policeman
and
taking
the
prisoner
under
the
arms
he
with
difficulty
pulled
his
body
a
little
higher
up
whats
this
gathering
here
said
a
decided
authoritative
voice
and
a
police
officer
with
a
wonderfully
clean
shiny
blouse
and
still
more
shiny
topboots
came
up
to
the
assembled
crowd
move
on
no
standing
about
here
he
shouted
to
the
crowd
before
he
knew
what
had
attracted
it
when
he
came
near
and
saw
the
dying
convict
he
made
a
sign
of
approval
with
his
head
just
as
if
he
had
quite
expected
it
and
turning
to
the
policeman
said
how
is
this
the
policeman
said
that
as
a
gang
of
prisoners
was
passing
one
of
the
convicts
had
fallen
down
and
the
convoy
officer
had
ordered
him
to
be
left
behind
well
thats
all
right

must
be
taken
to
the
police
station

an
isvostchik

porter

gone
for

said
the
policeman
with
his
fingers
raised
to
his
cap
the
shopman
began
something
about
the
heat
is
it
your
business
eh
move
on
said
the
police
officer
and
looked
so
severely
at
him
that
the
clerk
was
silenced
he
ought
to
have
a
little
water
said
nekhludoff
the
police
officer
looked
severely
at
nekhludoff
also
but
said
nothing
when
the
porter
brought
a
mug
full
of
water
he
told
the
policeman
to
offer
some
to
the
convict
the
policeman
raised
the
drooping
head
and
tried
to
pour
a
little
water
down
the
mouth
but
the
prisoner
could
not
swallow
it
and
it
ran
down
his
beard
wetting
his
jacket
and
his
coarse
dirty
linen
shirt
pour
it
on
his
head
ordered
the
officer
and
the
policeman
took
off
the
pancakeshaped
cap
and
poured
the
water
over
the
red
curls
and
bald
part
of
the
prisoners
head
his
eyes
opened
wide
as
if
in
fear
but
his
position
remained
unchanged
streams
of
dirt
trickled
down
his
dusty
face
but
the
mouth
continued
to
gasp
in
the
same
regular
way
and
his
whole
body
shook
and

the
dying
man
and
carried
him
to
the
trap
and
put
him
on
the
seat
but
he
could
not
sit
up
his
head
fell
back
and
the
whole
of
his
body
glided

sitting
down

round
the

the

in

and
put
them
into
the

the
police
officer
looked
around
and
noticing
the
pancakeshaped
hat
of
the
convict
lifted
it
up
and
put
it
on
the
wet
drooping
head

ordered

the
policeman
sitting
beside
the
convict
kept
dragging
up
the
body
that
was
continually
sliding
down
from
the
seat
while
the
head
swung
from
side
to
side
the
convoy
soldier
who
was
walking
by

the

several
firemen
with
their
sleeves
tucked
up
were
washing
some
kind
of

and
talking
loudly
when
the
trap
stopped
several
policemen
surrounded
it
and
taking
the
lifeless
body
of
the
convict
under
the
arms
took
him
out
of
the

under

the
policeman
who
had

where
the

was
taken

man
with
glistening
eyes
and
continually
moving
brows
with
only
his
underclothes
and
stockings
on
came
up
with
quick
soft
steps
looked
at
the
convict
and
then
at
nekhludoff
and
burst
into
loud
laughter

a
madman

and
a
medical
assistant
the
medical
assistant
came
up
to
the
body
and
touched
the
freckled
hand
already
growing
cold
which
though
still
soft
was
deadly
pale
he
held
it
for

the
medical

but
evidently
to
be
quite
in
order
he
undid
the
wet
brown
shirt
and
tossing
back
the
curls
from
his
ear
put
it
to
the

chest
of

it
down
again
nekhludoff
wished
to
follow
but
the
madman
kept
him
back
you
are
not
in
the
plot
well
then
give
me
a
cigarette
he
said
nekhludoff
got
out
his
cigarette
case
and
gave
him
one
the
madman
quickly
moving
his
brows
all
the
time
began
relating
how
they
tormented
him
by
thought
suggestion
why
they
are
all
against
me
and
torment
and
torture
me
through
their
mediums
i
beg
your
pardon
said
nekhludoff
and
without
listening
any
further
he
left
the
room
and
went
out
into
the
yard
wishing
to
know
where
the
body
would
be
put
the
policemen
with
their
burden
had
already
crossed
the
yard
and
were
coming
to
the
door
of
a
cellar
nekhludoff
wished
to
go
up
to
them
but
the
police
officer
stopped
him
what
do
you
want
nothing
nothing
then
go
away
nekhludoff
obeyed
and
went
back
to
his
isvostchik
who
was
dozing
he
awoke
him
and
they
drove
back
towards
the
railway
station
they
had
not
made
a
hundred
steps
when
they
met
a
cart
accompanied
by
a
convoy
soldier
with
a
gun
on
the
cart
lay
another
convict
who
was
already
dead
the
convict
lay
on
his
back
in
the
cart
his
shaved
head
from
which
the
pancakeshaped
cap
had
slid
over
the
blackbearded
face
down
to
the
nose
shaking
and
thumping
at
every
jolt
the
driver
in
his
heavy
boots
walked
by
the
side
of
the
cart
holding
the
reins
a
policeman
followed
on
foot
nekhludoff
touched
his
isvostchiks
shoulder
just
look
what
they
are
doing
said
the
isvostchik
stopping
his
horse
nekhludoff
got
down
and
following
the
cart
again
passed
the
sentinel
and
entered
the
gate
of
the
police
station
by
this
time
the
firemen
had
finished
washing
the
cart
and
a
tall
bony
man
the
chief
of
the
fire
brigade
with
a
coloured
band
round
his
cap
stood
in
their
place
and
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
was
severely
looking
at
a
fatnecked
wellfed
bay
stallion
that
was
being
led
up
and
down
before
him
by
a
fireman
the
stallion
was
lame
on
one
of
his
fore
feet
and
the
chief
of
the
firemen
was
angrily
saying
something
to
a
veterinary
who
stood
by
the
police
officer
was
also
present
when
he
saw
the
cart
he
went
up
to
the
convoy
soldier
where
did
you
bring
him
from
he
asked
shaking
his
head
disapprovingly
from
the
gorbatovskaya
answered
the
policeman
a
prisoner
asked
the
chief
of
the
fire
brigade
yes
its
the
second
today
well
i
must
say
theyve
got
some
queer
arrangements
though
of
course
its
a
broiling
day
said
the
chief
of
the
fire
brigade
then
turning
to
the
fireman
who
was
leading
the
lame
stallion
he
shouted
put
him
into
the
corner
stall
and
as
to
you
you
hound
ill
teach
you
how
to
cripple
horses
which
are
worth
more
than
you
are
you
scoundrel
the
dead
man
was
taken
from
the
cart
by
the
policemen
just
in
the
same
way
as
the
first
had
been
and
carried
upstairs
into
the
hospital
nekhludoff
followed
them
as
if
he
were
hypnotised
what
do
you
want
asked
one
of
the
policemen
but
nekhludoff
did
not
answer
and
followed
where
the
body
was
being
carried
the
madman
sitting
on
a
bed
was
smoking
greedily
the
cigarette
nekhludoff
had
given
him
ah
youve
come
back
he
said
and
laughed
when
he
saw
the
body
he
made
a
face
and
said
again
i
am
sick
of
it
i
am
not
a
boy
am
i
eh
and
he
turned
to
nekhludoff
with
a
questioning
smile
nekhludoff
was
looking
at
the
dead
man
whose
face
which
had
been
hidden
by
his
cap
was
now
visible
this
convict
was
as
handsome
in
face
and
body
as
the
other
was
hideous
he
was
a
man
in
the
full
bloom
of
life
notwithstanding
that
he
was
disfigured
by
the
half
of
his
head
being
shaved
the
straight
rather
low
forehead
raised
a
bit
over
the
black
lifeless
eyes
was
very
fine
and
so
was
the
nose
above
the
thin
black
moustaches
there
was
a
smile
on
the
lips
that
were
already
growing
blue
a
small
beard
outlined
the
lower
part
of
the
face
and
on
the
shaved
side
of
the
head
a
firm
wellshaped
ear
was
visible
one
could
see
what
possibilities
of
a
higher
life
had
been
destroyed
in
this
man
the
fine
bones
of
his
hands
and
shackled
feet
the
strong
muscles
of
all
his
wellproportioned
limbs
showed
what
a
beautiful
strong
agile
human
animal
this
had
been
as
an
animal
merely
he
had
been
a
far
more
perfect
one
of
his
kind
than
the
bay
stallion
about
the
laming
of
which
the
fireman
was
so
angry
yet
he
had
been
done
to
death
and
no
one
was
sorry
for
him
as
a
man
nor
was
any
one
sorry
that
so
fine
a
working
animal
had
perished
the
only
feeling
evinced
was
that
of
annoyance
because
of
the
bother
caused
by
the
necessity
of
getting
this
body
threatening
putrefaction
out
of
the
way
the
doctor
and
his
assistant
entered
the
hospital
accompanied
by
the
inspector
of
the
police
station
the
doctor
was
a
thickset
man
dressed
in
pongee
silk
coat
and
trousers
of
the
same
material
closely
fitting
his
muscular
thighs
the
inspector
was
a
little
fat
fellow
with
a
red
face
round
as
a
ball
which
he
made
still
broader
by
a
habit
he
had
of
filling
his
cheeks
with
air
and
slowly
letting
it
out
again
the
doctor
sat
down
on
the
bed
by
the
side
of
the
dead
man
and
touched
the
hands
in
the
same
way
as
his
assistant
had
done
put
his
ear
to
the
heart
rose
and
pulled
his
trousers
straight
could
not
be
more
dead
he
said
the
inspector
filled
his
mouth
with
air
and
slowly
blew
it
out
again
which
prison
is
he
from
he
asked
the
convoy
soldier
the
soldier
told
him
and
reminded
him
of
the
chains
on
the
dead
mans
feet
ill
have
them
taken
off
we
have
got
a
smith
about
the
lord
be
thanked
said
the
inspector
and
blew
up
his
cheeks
again
he
went
towards
the
door
slowly
letting
out
the
air
why
has
this
happened
nekhludoff
asked
the
doctor
the
doctor
looked
at
him
through
his
spectacles
why
has
what
happened
why
they
die
of
sunstroke
you
mean
this
is
why
they
sit
all
through
the
winter
without
exercise
and
without
light
and
suddenly
they
are
taken
out
into
the
sunshine
and
on
a
day
like
this
and
they
march
in
a
crowd
so
that
they
get
no
air
and
sunstroke
is
the
result
then
why
are
they
sent
out
oh
as
to
that
go
and
ask
those
who
send
them
but
may
i
ask
who
are
you
i
am
a
stranger
ah
well
goodafternoon
i
have
no
time
the
doctor
was
vexed
he
gave
his
trousers
a
downward
pull
and
went
towards
the
beds
of
the
sick
well
how
are
you
getting
on
he
asked
the
pale
man
with
the
crooked
mouth
and
bandaged
neck
meanwhile
the
madman
sat
on
a
bed
and
having
finished
his
cigarette
kept
spitting
in
the
direction
of
the
doctor
nekhludoff
went
down
into
the
yard
and
out
of
the
gate
past
the
firemens
horses
and
the
hens
and
the
sentinel
in
his
brass
helmet
and
got
into
the
trap
the
driver
of
which
had
again
fallen
asleep
chapter
xxxviii
the
convict
train
when
nekhludoff
came
to
the
station
the
prisoners
were
all
seated
in
railway
carriages
with
grated
windows
several
persons
come
to
see
them
off
stood
on
the
platform
but
were
not
allowed
to
come
up
to
the
carriages
the
convoy
was
much
troubled
that
day
on
the
way
from
the
prison
to
the
station
besides
the
two
nekhludoff
had
seen
three
other
prisoners
had
fallen
and
died
of
sunstroke
one
was
taken
to
the
nearest
police
station
like
the
first
two
and
the
other
two
died
at
the
railway
station
in
moscow
in
the
beginning
of
the
eighth
decade
of
this
century
five
convicts
died
of
sunstroke
in
one
day
on
their
way
from
the
boutyrki
prison
to
the
nijni
railway
station
the
convoy
men
were
not
troubled
because
five
men
who
might
have
been
alive
died
while
in
their
charge
this
did
not
trouble
them
but
they
were
concerned
lest
anything
that
the
law
required
in
such
cases
should
be
omitted
to
convey
the
bodies
to
the
places
appointed
to
deliver
up
their
papers
to
take
them
off
the
lists
of
those
to
be
conveyed
to
nijniall
this
was
very
troublesome
especially
on
so
hot
a
day
it
was
this
that
occupied
the
convoy
men
and
before
it
could
all
be
accomplished
nekhludoff
and
the
others
who
asked
for
leave
to
go
up
to
the
carriages
were
not
allowed
to
do
so
nekhludoff
however
was
soon
allowed
to
go
up
because
he
tipped
the
convoy
sergeant
the
sergeant
let
nekhludoff
pass
but
asked
him
to
be
quick
and
get
his
talk
over
before
any
of
the
authorities
noticed
there
were
15
carriages
in
all
and
except
one
carriage
for
the
officials
they
were
full
of
prisoners
as
nekhludoff
passed
the
carriages
he
listened
to
what
was
going
on
in
them
in
all
the
carriages
was
heard
the
clanging
of
chains
the
sound
of
bustle
mixed
with
loud
and
senseless
language
but
not
a
word
was
being
said
about
their
dead
fellowprisoners
the
talk
was
all
about
sacks
drinking
water
and
the
choice
of
seats
looking
into
one
of
the
carriages
nekhludoff
saw
convoy
soldiers
taking
the
manacles
off
the
hands
of
the
prisoners
the
prisoners
held
out
their
arms
and
one
of
the
soldiers
unlocked
the
manacles
with
a
key
and
took
them
off
the
other
collected
them
after
he
had
passed
all
the
other
carriages
nekhludoff
came
up
to
the
womens
carriages
from
the
second
of
these
he
heard
a
womans
groans
oh
oh
oh
o
god
oh
oh
o
god
nekhludoff
passed
this
carriage
and
went
up
to
a
window
of
the
third
carriage
which
a
soldier
pointed
out
to
him
when
he
approached
his
face
to
the
window
he
felt
the
hot
air
filled
with
the
smell
of
perspiration
coming
out
of
it
and
heard
distinctly
the
shrill
sound
of
womens
voices
all
the
seats
were
filled
with
red
perspiring
loudlytalking
women
dressed
in
prison
cloaks
and
white
jackets
nekhludoffs
face
at
the
window
attracted
their
attention
those
nearest
ceased
talking
and
drew
closer
maslova
in
her
white
jacket
and
her
head
uncovered
sat
by
the
opposite
window
the
whiteskinned
smiling
theodosia
sat
a
little
nearer
when
she
recognised
nekhludoff
she
nudged
maslova
and
pointed
to
the
window
maslova
rose
hurriedly
threw
her
kerchief
over
her
black
hair
and
with
a
smile
on
her
hot
red
face
came
up
to
the
window
and
took
hold
of
one
of
the
bars
well
it
is
hot
she
said
with
a
glad
smile
did
you
get
the
things
yes
thank
you
is
there
anything
more
you
want
asked
nekhludoff
while
the
air
came
out
of
the
hot
carriage
as
out
of
an
oven
i
want
nothing
thank
you
if
we
could
get
a
drink
said
theodosia
yes
if
we
could
get
a
drink
repeated
maslova
why
have
you
not
got
any
water
they
put
some
in
but
it
is
all
gone
directly
i
will
ask
one
of
the
convoy
men

shall
not
see
each
other
till
we
get
to
nijni
why
are
you
going
said
maslova
as
if
she
did
not
know
it
and
looked
joyfully
at
nekhludoff
i
am
going
by
the
next
train
maslova
said
nothing
but
only
sighed
deeply
is
it
true
sir
that
12
convicts
have
been
done
to
death
said
a
severelooking
old
prisoner
with
a
deep
voice
like
a
mans
it
was
korableva
i
did
not
hear
of

nekhludoff

laughed

she
said
pointing
to
the
next
carriage
whence
proceeded
the
groans

if
we
want
anything
said
maslova
trying
to
keep
the
smile
of
joy
from
her
lips
could
not
this
woman
be
left
behind

not
the
one
who
had
let
nekhludoff
come
up
nekhludoff
left
the
carriage
and
went
in
search
of
an
official
to
whom
he
might
speak
for
the
woman
in
travail
and
about
taras
but
could
not
find
him
nor
get
an
answer
from
any
of
the
convoy
for
a
long
time
they
were
all
in
a
bustle
some
were
leading
a
prisoner
somewhere
or
other
others
running
to
get
themselves
provisions
some
were
placing
their
things
in
the
carriages
or
attending
on
a
lady
who
was
going
to
accompany
the
convoy
officer
and
they
answered
nekhludoffs
questions
unwillingly
nekhludoff
found
the
convoy
officer
only
after
the
second
bell
had
been
rung
the
officer
with
his
short
arm
was
wiping
the
moustaches
that
covered
his
mouth
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
reproving
the
corporal
for
something
or
other
what
is
it
you
want
he
asked
nekhludoff
youve
got
a
woman
there
who
is
being
confined
so
i
thought
best
well
let
her
be
confined
we
shall
see
later
on
and
briskly
swinging
his
short
arms
he
ran
up
to
his
carriage
at
the
moment
the
guard
passed
with
a
whistle
in
his
hand
and
from
the
people
on
the
platform
and
from
the
womens
carriages
there
arose
a
sound
of
weeping
and
words
of
prayer
nekhludoff
stood
on
the
platform
by
the
side
of
taras
and
looked
how
one
after
the
other
the
carriages
glided
past
him
with
the
shaved
heads
of
the
men
at
the
grated
windows
then
the
first
of
the
womens
carriages
came
up
with
womens
heads
at
the
windows
some
covered
with
kerchiefs
and
some
uncovered
then
the
second
whence
proceeded
the
same
groans
then
the
carriage
where
maslova
was
she
stood
with
the
others
at
the
window
and
looked
at
nekhludoff
with
a
pathetic
smile

brother
and
sister
there
were
still
two
hours
before
the
passenger
train
by
which
nekhludoff
was
going
would
start
he
had
thought
of
using
this
interval
to
see
his
sister
again
but
after
the
impressions
of
the
morning
he
felt
much
excited
and
so
done
up
that
sitting
down
on
a
sofa
in
the
firstclass
refreshmentroom
he
suddenly
grew
so
drowsy
that
he
turned
over
on
to
his
side
and
laying
his
face
on
his
hand
fell
asleep
at
once
a
waiter
in
a
dress
coat
with
a
napkin
in
his
hand
woke
him
sir
sir
are
you
not
prince
nekhludoff
theres
a
lady
looking
for
you
nekhludoff
started
up
and
recollected
where
he
was
and
all
that
had
happened
in
the
morning
he
saw
in
his
imagination
the
procession
of
prisoners
the
dead
bodies
the
railway
carriages
with
barred
windows
and
the
women
locked
up
in
them
one
of
whom
was
groaning
in
travail
with
no
one
to
help
her
and
another
who
was
pathetically
smiling
at
him
through
the
bars
the
reality
before
his
eyes
was
very
different
ie
a
table
with
vases
candlesticks
and
crockery
and
agile
waiters
moving
round
the
table
and
in
the
background
a
cupboard
and
a
counter
laden
with
fruit
and
bottles
behind
it
a
barman
and
in
front
the
backs
of
passengers
who
had
come
up
for
refreshments
when
nekhludoff
had
risen
and
sat
gradually
collecting
his
thoughts
he
noticed
that
everybody
in
the
room
was
inquisitively
looking
at
something
that
was
passing
by
the
open
doors
he
also
looked
and
saw
a
group
of
people
carrying
a
chair
on
which
sat
a
lady
whose
head
was
wrapped
in
a
kind
of
airy
fabric
nekhludoff
thought
he
knew
the
footman
who
was
supporting
the
chair
in
front
and
also
the
man
behind
and
a
doorkeeper
with
gold
cord
on
his
cap
seemed
familiar
a
ladys
maid
with
a
fringe
and
an
apron
who
was
carrying
a
parcel
a
parasol
and
something
round
in
a
leather
case
was
walking
behind
the
chair
then
came
prince
korchagin
with
his
thick
lips
apoplectic
neck
and
a
travelling
cap
on
his
head
behind
him
missy
her
cousin
misha
and
an
acquaintance
of
nekhludoffsthe
longnecked
diplomat
osten
with
his
protruding
adams
apple
and
his
unvarying
merry
mood
and
expression
he
was
saying
something
very
emphatically
though
jokingly
to
the
smiling
missy
the
korchagins
were
moving
from
their
estate
near
the
city
to
the
estate
of
the
princesss

the

carrying
the

and

into
the
ladies
waitingroom
evoking
a
feeling
of
curiosity
and
respect
in
the
onlookers
but
the
old
prince
remained
and
sat
down
at
the
table
called
a
waiter
and
ordered
food
and
drink
missy
and
osten
also
remained
in
the
refreshmentroom
and
were
about
to
sit
down
when
they
saw
an
acquaintance
in
the
doorway
and
went
up
to
her
it
was
nathalie
rogozhinsky
nathalie
came
into
the
refreshmentroom
accompanied
by
agraphena
petrovna
and
both
looked
round
the
room
nathalie
noticed
at
one
and
the
same
moment
both
her
brother
and
missy
she
first
went
up
to
missy
only
nodding
to
her
brother
but
having
kissed
her
at
once
turned
to
him
at
last
i
have
found
you
she
said
nekhludoff
rose
to
greet
missy
misha
and
osten
and
to
say
a
few
words
to
them
missy
told
him
about
their
house
in
the
country
having
been
burnt
down
which
necessitated
their
moving
to
her
aunts
osten
began
relating
a
funny
story
about
a
fire
nekhludoff
paid
no
attention
and
turned
to
his
sister
how
glad
i
am
that
you
have
come
i
have
been
here
a
long
time
she
said
agraphena
petrovna
is
with
me
and
she
pointed
to
agraphena
petrovna
who
in
a
waterproof
and
with
a
bonnet
on
her
head
stood
some
way
off
and
bowed
to
him
with
kindly
dignity
and
some
confusion
not
wishing
to
intrude
we
looked
for
you
everywhere
and
i
had
fallen
asleep
here
how
glad
i
am
that
you
have
come
repeated
nekhludoff
i
had
begun
to
write
to
you
really
she
said
looking
frightened
what
about
missy
and
the
gentleman
noticing
that
an
intimate
conversation
was
about
to
commence
between
the
brother
and
sister
went
away
nekhludoff
and
his
sister
sat
down
by
the
window
on
a
velvetcovered
sofa
on
which
lay
a
plaid
a
box
and
a
few
other
things
yesterday
after
i
left
you
i
felt
inclined
to
return
and
express
my
regret
but
i
did
not
know
how
he
would
take
it
said
nekhludoff
i
spoke
hastily
to
your
husband
and
this
tormented
me
i
knew
said
his
sister
that
you
did
not
mean
to
oh
you
know
and
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
she
touched
his
hand
the
sentence
was
not
clear
but
he
understood
it
perfectly
and
was
touched
by
what
it
expressed
her
words
meant
that
besides
the
love
for
her
husband
which
held
her
in
its
sway
she
prized
and
considered
important
the
love
she
had
for
him
her
brother
and
that
every
misunderstanding
between
them
caused
her
deep
suffering
thank
you
thank
you
oh
what
i
have
seen
today
he
said
suddenly
recalling
the
second
of
the
dead
convicts
two
prisoners
have
been
done
to
death
done
to
death
how
yes
done
to
death
they
led
them
in
this
heat
and
two
died
of
sunstroke
impossible
what
today
just
now
yes
just
now
i
have
seen
their
bodies
but
why
done
to
death
who
killed
them
asked
nathalie
they
who
forced
them
to
go
killed
them
said
nekhludoff
with
irritation
feeling
that
she
looked
at
this
too
with
her
husbands
eyes
oh
lord
said
agraphena
petrovna
who
had
come
up
to
them
yes
we
have
not
the
slightest
idea
of
what
is
being
done
to
these
unfortunate
beings
but
it
ought
to
be
known
added
nekhludoff
and
looked
at
old
korchagin
who
sat
with
a
napkin
tied
round
him
and
a
bottle
before
him
and
who
looked
round
at
nekhludoff
nekhludoff
he
called
out
wont
you
join
me
and
take
some
refreshment
it
is
excellent
before
a
journey
nekhludoff
refused
and
turned
away
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
nathalie
continued
what
i
can
i
dont
know
but
i
feel
i
must
do
something
and
i
shall
do
what
i
am
able
to
yes
i
understand
and
how
about
them
she
continued
with
a
smile
and
a
look
towards
korchagin
is
it
possible
that
it
is
all
over
completely
and
i
think
without
any
regret
on
either
side
it
is
a
pity
i
am
sorry
i
am
fond
of
her
however
its
all
right
but
why
do
you
wish
to
bind
yourself
she
added
shyly
why
are
you
going
i
go
because
i
must
answered
nekhludoff
seriously
and
dryly
as
if
wishing
to
stop
this
conversation
but
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
coldness
towards
his
sister
at
once
why
not
tell
her
all
i
am
thinking
he
thought
and
let
agraphena
petrovna
also
hear
it
he
thought
with
a
look
at
the
old
servant
whose
presence
made
the
wish
to
repeat
his
decision
to
his
sister
even
stronger
you
mean
my
intention
to
marry
katusha
well
you
see
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
it
but
she
refuses
definitely
and
firmly
he
said
and
his
voice
shook
as
it
always
did
when
he
spoke
of
it
she
does
not
wish
to
accept
my
sacrifice
but
is
herself
sacrificing
what
in
her
position
means
much
and
i
cannot
accept
this
sacrifice
if
it
is
only
a
momentary
impulse
and
so
i
am
going
with
her
and
shall
be
where
she
is
and
shall
try
to
lighten
her
fate
as
much
as
i
can
nathalie
said
nothing
agraphena
petrovna
looked
at
her
with
a
questioning
look
and
shook
her
head
at
this
moment
the
former
procession
issued
from
the
ladies
room
the
same
handsome
footman
philip
and
the
doorkeeper
were
carrying
the
princess
korchagin
she
stopped
the
men
who
were
carrying
her
and
motioned
to
nekhludoff
to
approach
and
with
a
pitiful
languishing
air
she
extended
her
white
ringed
hand
expecting
the
firm
pressure
of
his
hand
with
a
sense
of
horror
epouvantable
she
said
meaning
the
heat
i
cannot
stand
it
ce
climat
me
tue
and
after
a
short
talk
about
the
horrors
of
the
russian
climate
she
gave
the
men
a
sign
to
go
on
be
sure
and
come
she
added
turning
her
long
face
towards
nekhludoff
as
she
was
borne
away
the
procession
with
the
princess
turned
to
the
right
towards
the
firstclass
carriages
nekhludoff
with
the
porter
who
was
carrying
his
things
and
taras
with
his
bag
turned
to
the
left
this
is
my
companion
said
nekhludoff
to
his
sister
pointing
to
taras
whose
story
he
had
told
her
before
surely
not
third
class
said
nathalie
when
nekhludoff
stopped
in
front
of
a
thirdclass
carriage
and
taras
and
the
porter
with
the
things
went
in
yes
it
is
more
convenient
for
me
to
be
with
taras
he
said
one
thing
more
he
added
up
to
now
i
have
not
given
the
kousminski
land
to
the
peasants
so
that
in
case
of
my
death
your
children
will
inherit
it
dmitri
dont
said
nathalie
if
i
do
give
it
away
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
rest
will
be
theirs
as
it
is
not
likely
i
shall
marry
and
if
i
do
marry
i
shall
have
no
children
so
that
dmitri
dont
talk
like
that
said
nathalie
and
yet
nekhludoff
noticed
that
she
was
glad
to
hear
him
say
it
higher
up
by
the
side
of
a
firstclass
carriage
there
stood
a
group
of
people
still
looking
at
the
carriage
into
which
the
princess
korchagin
had
been
carried
most
of
the
passengers
were
already
seated
some
of
the
late
comers
hurriedly
clattered
along
the
boards
of
the
platform
the
guard
was
closing
the
doors
and
asking
the
passengers
to
get
in
and
those
who
were
seeing
them
off
to
come
out
nekhludoff
entered
the
hot
smelling
carriage
but
at
once
stepped
out
again
on
to
the
small
platform
at
the
back
of
the
carriage
nathalie
stood
opposite
the
carriage
with
her
fashionable
bonnet
and
cape
by
the
side
of
agraphena
petrovna
and
was
evidently
trying
to
find
something
to
say
she
could
not
even
say
ecrivez
because
they
had
long
ago
laughed
at
this
word
habitually
spoken
by
those
about
to
part
the
short
conversation
about
money
matters
had
in
a
moment
destroyed
the
tender
brotherly
and
sisterly
feelings
that
had
taken
hold
of
them
they
felt
estranged
so
that
nathalie
was
glad
when
the
train
moved
and
she
could
only
say
nodding
her
head
with
a
sad
and
tender
look
goodbye
goodbye
dmitri
but
as
soon
as
the
carriage
had
passed
her
she
thought
of
how
she
should
repeat
her
conversation
with
her
brother
to
her
husband
and
her
face
became
serious
and
troubled
nekhludoff
too
though
he
had
nothing
but
the
kindest
feelings
for
his
sister
and
had
hidden
nothing
from
her
now
felt
depressed
and
uncomfortable
with
her
and
was
glad
to
part
he
felt
that
the
nathalie
who
was
once
so
near
to
him
no
longer
existed
and
in
her
place
was
only
a
slave
of
that
hairy
unpleasant
husband
who
was
so
foreign
to
him
he
saw
it
clearly
when
her
face
lit
up
with
peculiar
animation
as
he
spoke
of
what
would
peculiarly
interest
her
husband
ie
the
giving
up
of
the
land
to
the
peasants
and
the
inheritance
and
this
made
him
sad
chapter
xl
the
fundamental
law
of
human
life
the
heat
in
the
large
thirdclass
carriage
which
had
been
standing
in
the
burning
sun
all
day
was
so
great
that
nekhludoff
did
not
go
in
but
stopped
on
the
little
platform
behind
the
carriage
which
formed
a
passage
to
the
next
one
but
there
was
not
a
breath
of
fresh
air
here
either
and
nekhludoff
breathed
freely
only
when
the
train
had
passed
the
buildings
and
the
draught
blew
across
the
platform
yes
killed
he
repeated
to
himself
the
words
he
had
used
to
his
sister
and
in
his
imagination
in
the
midst
of
all
other
impressions
there
arose
with
wonderful
clearness
the
beautiful
face
of
the
second
dead
convict
with
the
smile
of
the
lips
the
severe
expression
of
the
brows
and
the
small
firm
ear
below
the
shaved
bluish
skull
and
what
seemed
terrible
was
that
he
had
been
murdered
and
no
one
knew
who
had
murdered
him
yet
he
had
been
murdered
he
was
led
out
like
all
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
by
maslennikoffs
orders
maslennikoff
had
probably
given
the
order
in
the
usual
manner
had
signed
with
his
stupid
flourish
the
paper
with
the
printed
heading
and
most
certainly
would
not
consider
himself
guilty
still
less
would
the
careful
doctor
who
examined
the
convicts
consider
himself
guilty
he
had
performed
his
duty
accurately
and
had
separated
the
weak
how
could
he
have
foreseen
this
terrible
heat
or
the
fact
that
they
would
start
so
late
in
the
day
and
in
such
crowds
the
prison
inspector
but
the
inspector
had
only
carried
into
execution
the
order
that
on
a
given
day
a
certain
number
of
exiles
and
convictsmen
and
womenhad
to
be
sent
off
the
convoy
officer
could
not
be
guilty
either
for
his
business
was
to
receive
a
certain
number
of
persons
in
a
certain
place
and
to
deliver
up
the
same
number
he
conducted
them
in
the
usual
manner
and
could
not
foresee
that
two
such
strong
men
as
those
nekhludoff
saw
would
not
be
able
to
stand
it
and
would
die
no
one
is
guilty
and
yet
the
men
have
been
murdered
by
these
people
who
are
not
guilty
of
their
murder
all
this
comes
nekhludoff
thought
from
the
fact
that
all
these
people
governors
inspectors
police
officers
and
men
consider
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
human
relations
are
not
necessary
between
human
beings
all
these
men
maslennikoff
and
the
inspector
and
the
convoy
officer
if
they
were
not
governor
inspector
officer
would
have
considered
twenty
times
before
sending
people
in
such
heat
in
such
a
masswould
have
stopped
twenty
times
on
the
way
and
seeing
that
a
man
was
growing
weak
gasping
for
breath
would
have
led
him
into
the
shade
would
have
given
him
water
and
let
him
rest
and
if
an
accident
had
still
occurred
they
would
have
expressed
pity
but
they
not
only
did
not
do
it
but
hindered
others
from
doing
it
because
they
considered
not
men
and
their
duty
towards
them
but
only
the
office
they
themselves
filled
and
held
what
that
office
demanded
of
them
to
be
above
human
relations
thats
what
it
is
nekhludoff
went
on
in
his
thoughts
if
one
acknowledges
but
for
a
single
hour
that
anything
can
be
more
important
than
love
for
ones
fellowmen
even
in
some
one
exceptional
case
any
crime
can
be
committed
without
a
feeling
of
guilt
nekhludoff
was
so
engrossed
by
his
thoughts
that
he
did
not
notice
how
the
weather
changed
the
sun
was
covered
over
by
a
lowhanging
ragged
cloud
a
compact
light
grey
cloud
was
rapidly
coming
from
the
west
and
was
already
falling
in
heavy
driving
rain
on
the
fields
and
woods
far
in
the
distance
moisture
coming
from
the
cloud
mixed
with
the
air
now
and
then
the
cloud
was
rent
by
flashes
of
lightning
and
peals
of
thunder
mingled
more
and
more
often
with
the
rattling
of
the
train
the
cloud
came
nearer
and
nearer
the
raindrops
driven
by
the
wind
began
to
spot
the
platform
and
nekhludoffs
coat
and
he
stepped
to
the
other
side
of
the
little
platform
and
inhaling
the
fresh
moist
airfilled
with
the
smell
of
corn
and
wet
earth
that
had
long
been
waiting
for
rainhe
stood
looking
at
the
gardens
the
woods
the
yellow
rye
fields
the
green
oatfields
the
darkgreen
strips
of
potatoes
in
bloom
that
glided
past
everything
looked
as
if
covered
over
with
varnishthe
green
turned
greener
the
yellow
yellower
the
black
blacker
more
more
said
nekhludoff
gladdened
by
the
sight
of
gardens
and
fields
revived
by
the
beneficent
shower
the
shower
did
not
last
long
part
of
the
cloud
had
come
down
in
rain
part
passed
over
and
the
last
fine
drops
fell
straight
on
to
the
earth
the
sun
reappeared
everything
began
to
glisten
and
in
the
eastnot
very
high
above
the
horizonappeared
a
bright
rainbow
with
the
violet
tint
very
distinct
and
broken
only
at
one
end
why
what
was
i
thinking
about
nekhludoff
asked
himself
when
all
these
changes
in
nature
were
over
and
the
train
ran
into
a
cutting
between
two
high
banks
oh
i
was
thinking
that
all
those
people
inspector
convoy
menall
those
in
the
service
are
for
the
greater
part
kind
peoplecruel
only
because
they
are
serving
he
recalled
maslennikoffs
indifference
when
he
told
him
about
what
was
being
done
in
the
prison
the
inspectors
severity
the
cruelty
of
the
convoy
officer
when
he
refused
places
on
the
carts
to
those
who
asked
for
them
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
woman
in
travail
in
the
train
all
these
people
were
evidently
invulnerable
and
impregnable
to
the
simplest
feelings
of
compassion
only
because
they
held
offices
as
officials
they
were
impermeable
to
the
feelings
of
humanity
as
this
paved
ground
is
impermeable
to
the
rain
thus
thought
nekhludoff
as
he
looked
at
the
railway
embankment
paved
with
stones
of
different
colours
down
which
the
water
was
running
in
streams
instead
of
soaking
into
the
earth
perhaps
it
is
necessary
to
pave
the
banks
with
stones
but
it
is
sad
to
look
at
the
ground
which
might
be
yielding
corn
grass
bushes
or
trees
in
the
same
way
as
the
ground
visible
up
there
is
doingdeprived
of
vegetation
and
so
it
is
with
men
thought
nekhludoff
perhaps
these
governors
inspectors
policemen
are
needed
but
it
is
terrible
to
see
men
deprived
of
the
chief
human
attribute
that
of
love
and
sympathy
for
one
another
the
thing
is
he
continued
that
these
people
consider
lawful
what
is
not
lawful
and
do
not
consider
the
eternal
immutable
law
written
in
the
hearts
of
men
by
god
as
law
that
is
why
i
feel
so
depressed
when
i
am
with
these
people
i
am
simply
afraid
of
them
and
really
they
are
terrible
more
terrible
than
robbers
a
robber
might
after
all
feel
pity
but
they
can
feel
no
pity
they
are
inured
against
pity
as
these
stones
are
against
vegetation
that
is
what
makes
them
terrible
it
is
said
that
the
pougatcheffs
the
razins
leaders
of
rebellions
in
russia
stonka
razin
in
the
17th
and
pougatcheff
in
the
18th
century
are
terrible
these
are
a
thousand
times
more
terrible
he
continued
in
his
thoughts
if
a
psychological
problem
were
set
to
find
means
of
making
men
of
our
timechristian
humane
simple
kind
peopleperform
the
most
horrible
crimes
without
feeling
guilty
only
one
solution
could
be
devised
to
go
on
doing
what
is
being
done
it
is
only
necessary
that
these
people
should
he
governors
inspectors
policemen
that
they
should
be
fully
convinced
that
there
is
a
kind
of
business
called
government
service
which
allows
men
to
treat
other
men
as
things
without
human
brotherly
relations
with
them
and
also
that
these
people
should
be
so
linked
together
by
this
government
service
that
the
responsibility
for
the
results
of
their
actions
should
not
fall
on
any
one
of
them
separately
without
these
conditions
the
terrible
acts
i
witnessed
today
would
be
impossible
in
our
times
it
all
lies
in
the
fact
that
men
think
there
are
circumstances
in
which
one
may
deal
with
human
beings
without
love
and
there
are
no
such
circumstances
one
may
deal
with
things
without
love
one
may
cut
down
trees
make
bricks
hammer
iron
without
love
but
you
cannot
deal
with
men
without
it
just
as
one
cannot
deal
with
bees
without
being
careful
if
you
deal
carelessly
with
bees
you
will
injure
them
and
will
yourself
be
injured
and
so
with
men
it
cannot
be
otherwise
because
natural
love
is
the
fundamental
law
of
human
life
it
is
true
that
a
man
cannot
force
another
to
love
him
as
he
can
force
him
to
work
for
him
but
it
does
not
follow
that
a
man
may
deal
with
men
without
love
especially
to
demand
anything
from
them
if
you
feel
no
love
sit
still
nekhludoff
thought
occupy
yourself
with
things
with
yourself
with
anything
you
like
only
not
with
men
you
can
only
eat
without
injuring
yourself
when
you
feel
inclined
to
eat
so
you
can
only
deal
with
men
usefully
when
you
love
only
let
yourself
deal
with
a
man
without
love
as
i
did
yesterday
with
my
brotherinlaw
and
there
are
no
limits
to
the
suffering
you
will
bring
on
yourself
as
all
my
life
proves
yes
yes
it
is
so
thought
nekhludoff
it
is
good
yes
it
is
good
he
repeated
enjoying
the
freshness
after
the
torturing
heat
and
conscious
of
having
attained
to
the
fullest
clearness

occupied
him

one
and
an
old
one
with
bracelets
on
her
arm
and
a
severelooking
gentleman
with
a
cockade
on
his
black
cap
all
these
people
were
sitting
quietly
the
bustle
of
taking
their
places
was
long
over
some
sat
cracking
and
eating
sunflower
seeds
some
smoking
some
talking
taras
sat
looking
very
happy
opposite
the
door
keeping
a
place
for
nekhludoff
and
carrying
on
an
animated
conversation
with
a
man
in
a
cloth
coat
who
sat
opposite
to
him
and
who
was
as
nekhludoff
afterwards
found
out
a
gardener
going
to
a
new
situation
before
reaching
the
place
where
taras
sat
nekhludoff
stopped
between
the
seats
near
a
reverendlooking
old
man
with
a
white
beard
and
nankeen
coat
who
was
talking
with
a
young
woman
in
peasant
dress
a
little
girl
of
about
seven
dressed
in
a
new
peasant
costume
sat
her
little
legs
dangling
above
the
floor
by
the
side
of
the
woman
and
kept
cracking
seeds
the
old
man
turned
round
and
seeing
nekhludoff
he
moved
the
lappets
of
his
coat
off
the
varnished
seat
next
to
him
and
said
in
a
friendly
manner
please
heres
a
seat
nekhludoff
thanked
him
and
took
the
seat
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
the
woman
continued
the
interrupted
conversation
she
was
returning
to
her
village
and
related
how
her
husband
whom
she
had
been
visiting
had
received
her
in
town
i
was
there
during
the
carnival
and
now
by
the
lords
help
ive
been
again
she
said
then
god
willing
at
christmas
ill
go
again
thats
right
said
the
old
man
with
a
look
at
nekhludoff
its
the
best
way
to
go
and
see
him
else
a
young
man
can
easily
go
to
the
bad
living
in
a
town
oh
no
sir
mine
is
not
such
a
man
no
nonsense
of
any
kind
about
him
his
life
is
as
good
as
a
young
maidens
the
money
he
earns
he
sends
home
all
to
a
copeck
and
as
to
our
girl
here
he
was
so
glad
to
see
her
there
are
no
words
for
it
said
the
woman
and
smiled
the
little
girl
who
sat
cracking
her
seeds
and
spitting
out
the
shells
listened
to
her
mothers
words
and
as
if
to
confirm
them
looked
up
with
calm
intelligent
eyes
into
nekhludoffs
and
the
old
mans
faces
well
if
hes
good
thats
better
still
said
the
old
man
and
none
of
that
sort
of
thing
he
added
with
a
look
at
a
couple
evidently
factory
hands
who
sat
at
the
other
side
of
the
carriage
the
husband
with
his
head
thrown
back
was
pouring
vodka
down
his
throat
out
of
a
bottle
and
the
wife
sat
holding
a
bag
out
of
which
they
had
taken
the
bottle
and
watched
him
intently
no
mine
neither
drinks
nor
smokes
said
the
woman
who
was
conversing
with
the
old
man
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
praising
her
husband
once
more
no
sir
the
earth
does
not
hold
many
such
and
turning
to
nekhludoff
she
added
thats
the
sort
of
man
he
is
what
could
be
better
said
the
old
man
looking
at
the
factory
worker
who
had
had
his
drink
and
had
passed
the
bottle
to
his
wife
the
wife
laughed
shook
her
head
and
also
raised
the
bottle
to
her
lips
noticing
nekhludoffs
and
the
old
mans
look
directed
towards
them
the
factory
worker
addressed
the
former
what
is
it

are
drinking
ah

one

how

it
and
i
am

and
treating

wife
and
no
one

said
nekhludoff
not
knowing
what
to
say
true

wife

a
steady
woman
i

the
wife
returning
the
bottle
to
him
and
what
are

jawing
for
like
that
she
added
there

wheel

mavra

mavra
laughed
and
moved
her
hand
with
a
tipsy
gesture
oh

at
it
again
there
now
shes

but

saying
you

me
sir
ive
had
a
drop
whats
to
be
done
said
the
factory
worker
and
preparing
to
go
to
sleep
put
his
head
in
his
wifes
lap
nekhludoff
sat
a
while
with
the
old
man
who
told
him
all
about
himself
the
old
man
was
a
stove
builder
who
had
been
working
for
53
years
and
had
built
so
many
stoves
that
he
had
lost
count
and
now
he
wanted
to
rest
but
had
no
time
he
had
been
to
town
and
found
employment
for
the
young
ones
and
was
now
going
to
the
country
to
see
the
people
at
home
after
hearing
the
old
mans
story
nekhludoff
went
to
the
place
that
taras
was
keeping
for
him
its
all
right
sir
sit
down
well
put
the
bag
here
said
the
gardener
who
sat
opposite
taras
in
a
friendly
tone
looking
up
into
nekhludoffs
face
rather
a
tight
fit
but
no
matter
since
we
are
friends
said
taras
smiling
and
lifting
the
bag
which
weighed
more
than
five
stone
as
if
it
were
a
feather
he
carried
it
across
to
the
window
plenty
of
room
besides
we
might
stand
up
a
bit
and
even
under
the
seat
its
as
comfortable
as
you
could
wish
whats
the
good
of
humbugging
he
said
beaming
with
friendliness
and
kindness
taras
spoke
of
himself
as
being
unable
to
utter
a
word
when
quite
sober
but
drink
he
said
helped
him
to
find
the
right
words
and
then
he
could
express
everything
and
in
reality
when
he
was
sober
taras
kept
silent
but
when
he
had
been
drinking
which
happened
rarely
and
only
on
special
occasions
he
became
very
pleasantly
talkative
then
he
spoke
a
great
deal
spoke
well
and
very
simply
and
truthfully
and
especially
with
great
kindliness
which
shone
in
his
gentle
blue
eyes
and
in
the
friendly
smile
that
never
left
his
lips
he
was
in
such
a
state
today
nekhludoffs
approach
interrupted
the
conversation
but
when
he
had
put
the
bag
in
its
place
taras
sat
down
again
and
with
his
strong
hands
folded
in
his
lap
and
looking
straight
into
the
gardeners
face
continued
his
story
he
was
telling
his
new
acquaintance
about
his
wife
and
giving
every
detail
what
she
was
being
sent
to
siberia
for
and
why
he
was
now
following
her
nekhludoff
had
never
heard
a
detailed
account
of
this
affair
and
so
he
listened
with
interest
when
he
came
up
the
story
had
reached
the
point
when
the
attempt
to
poison
was
already
an
accomplished
fact
and
the
family
had
discovered
that
it
was
theodosias
doing
its
about
my
troubles
that
im
talking
said
taras
addressing
nekhludoff
with
cordial
friendliness
i
have
chanced
to
come
across
such
a
hearty
man
and
weve
got
into
conversation
and
im
telling
him
all
i
see
said
nekhludoff
well
then
in
this
way
my
friend
the
business
became
known
mother
she
takes
that
cake
im
going
says
she
to
the
police
officer
my
father
is
a
just
old
man
wait
wife
says
he
the
little
woman
is
a
mere
child
and
did
not
herself
know
what
she
was
doing
we
must
have
pity
she
may
come
to
her
senses
but
dear
me
mother
would
not
hear
of
it
while
we
keep
her
here
she
says
she
may
destroy
us
all
like
cockroaches
well
friend
so
she
goes
off
for
the
police
officer
he
bounces
in
upon
us
at
once
calls
for
witnesses
well
and
you
asked
the
gardener
well
i
you
see
friend
roll
about
with
the
pain
in
my
stomach
and
vomit
all
my
inside
is
turned
inside
out
i
cant
even
speak
well
so
father
he
goes
and
harnesses
the
mare
and
puts
theodosia
into
the
cart
and
is
off
to
the
policestation
and
then
to
the
magistrates
and
she
you
know
just
as
she
had
done
from
the
first
so
also
there
confesses
all
to
the
magistratewhere
she
got
the
arsenic
and
how
she
kneaded
the
cake
why
did
you
do
it
says
he
why
says
she
because
hes
hateful
to
me
i
prefer
siberia
to
a
life
with
him
thats
me
and
taras
smiled
well
so
she
confessed
all
then
naturallythe
prison
and
father
returns
alone
and
harvest
time
just
coming
and
mother
the
only
woman
at
home
and
she
no
longer
strong
so
we
think
what
we
are
to
do
could
we
not
bail
her
out
so
father
went
to
see
an
official
no
go
then
another
i
think
he
went
to
five
of
them
and
we
thought
of
giving
it
up
then
we
happened
to
come
across
a
clerksuch
an
artful
one
as
you
dont
often
find
you
give
me
five
roubles
and
ill
get
her
out
says
he
he
agreed
to
do
it
for
three
well
and
what
do
you
think
friend
i
went
and
pawned
the
linen
she
herself
had
woven
and
gave
him
the
money
as
soon
as
he
had
written
that
paper
drawled
out
taras
just
as
if
he
were
speaking
of
a
shot
being
fired
we
succeeded
at
once
i
went
to
fetch
her
myself
well
friend
so
i
got
to
town
put
up
the
mare
took
the
paper
and
went
to
the
prison
what
do

is
what
i
want
say
i
youve
got
my
wife
here
in

and
have
you
got
a
paper
i
gave
him
the
paper
he
gave
it
a
look
wait
says
he
so
i
sat
down
on
a
bench
it
was
already
past
noon
by
the
sun
an
official
comes

it
with
sacking
for
her

and
wrapped
her
shawl
round

she
instead
of
resting
rushes
off
to
the
barn
to
make
binders
for
the
sheaves
for
next
day
such
a
change
well
and
to
you
was
she
kinder
now
asked
the
gardener
thats
beyond
question
she
clings
to
me
as
if
we
were
one
soul
whatever
i
think
she
understands
even
mother
angry
as
she
was
could
not
help
saying
its
as
if
our
theodosia
had
been
transformed
shes
quite
a
different
woman
now
we
were
once
going
to
cart
the
sheaves
with
two
carts
she
and
i
were
in
the
first
and
i
say
how
could
you
think
of
doing
that
theodosia
and
she
says
how
could
i
think
of
it
just
so
i
did
not
wish
to
live
with
you
i
thought
id
rather
die
than
live
with
you
i
say
and
now
and
she
says
now
youre
in
my
heart
taras
stopped
and
smiled
joyfully
shook
his
head
as
if
surprised
hardly
had
we
got
the
harvest
home
when
i
went
to
soak
the
hemp
and
when
i
got
home
there
was
a
summons
she
must
go
to
be
tried
and
we
had
forgotten
all
about
the
matter
that
she
was
to
be
tried
for
it
can
only
be
the
evil
one
said
the
gardener
could
any
man
of
himself
think
of
destroying
a
living
soul
we
had
a
fellow
once
and
the
gardener
was
about
to
commence
his
tale
when
the
train
began
to
stop
it
seems
we
are
coming
to
a
station
he
said
ill
go
and
have
a
drink
the
conversation
stopped
and
nekhludoff
followed
the
gardener
out
of
the
carriage
onto
the
wet
platform
of
the
station

before
nekhludoff
got
out
he
had
noticed
in
the
station
yard
several
elegant
equipages
some
with
three
some
with
four
wellfed
horses
with
tinkling
bells
on
their
harness
when
he
stepped
out
on
the
wet
darkcoloured
boards
of
the
platform
he
saw
a
group
of
people
in
front
of
the
firstclass
carriage
among
whom
were
conspicuous
a
stout
lady
with
costly
feathers
on
her
hat
and
a
waterproof
and
a
tall
thinlegged
young
man
in
a
cycling
suit
the
young
man
had
by
his
side
an
enormous
wellfed
dog
with
a
valuable
collar
behind
them
stood
footmen
holding
wraps
and
umbrellas
and
a
coachman
who
had
also
come
to
meet
the
train
on
the
whole
of
the
group
from
the
fat
lady
down
to
the
coachman
who
stood
holding
up
his
long
coat
there
lay
the
stamp
of
wealth
and
quiet
selfassurance
a
curious
and
servile
crowd
rapidly
gathered
round

the
guard
with
his
gold
cord
and
shiny
topboots
opened
the
carriage
door
and
stood
holding
it
as
a
sign
of
deference
while
philip
and
a
porter
with
a
white
apron
carefully
carried
out
the
longfaced
princess
in

folding

to

over

stopped
before
he
got
to
the
door
waiting
for
the
procession
to
pass
the

the
old
prince
and
his
sisterinlaw
remained
behind
nekhludoff
was
too
far
to
catch
anything
but
a
few
disconnected
french
sentences
of
their
conversation
one
of
the
sentences
uttered
by
the
prince
as
it
often
happens
for
some
unaccountable
reason
remained
in
his
memory
with
all
its
intonations
and
the
sound
of
the
voice
oh
il
est
du
vrai
grand
monde
du
vrai
grand
monde
said
the
prince
in
his
loud
selfassured
tone
as
he
went
out
of
the
station
with
his
sisterinlaw
accompanied
by
the
respectful
guards
and
porters
at
this
moment
from
behind
the
corner
of
the
station
suddenly
appeared
a
crowd
of
workmen
in
bark
shoes
wearing
sheepskin
coats
and
carrying
bags
on
their
backs
the
workmen
went
up
to
the
nearest
carriage
with
soft
yet
determined
steps
and
were
about
to
get
in
but
were
at
once
driven
away
by
a
guard
without
stopping
the
workmen
passed
on
hurrying
and
jostling
one
another
to
the
next
carriage
and
began
getting
in
catching
their
bags
against
the
corners
and
door
of
the
carriage
but
another
guard
caught
sight
of
them
from
the
door
of
the
station
and
shouted
at
them
severely
the
workmen
who
had
already
got
in
hurried
out
again
and
went
on
with
the
same
soft
and
firm
steps
still
further
towards
nekhludoffs
carriage
a
guard
was
again
going
to
stop
them
but
nekhludoff
said
there
was
plenty
of
room
inside
and
that
they
had
better
get
in
they
obeyed
and
got
in
followed
by
nekhludoff
the
workmen
were
about
to
take
their
seats
when
the
gentleman
with
the
cockade
and
the
two
ladies
looking
at
this
attempt
to
settle
in
their
carriage
as
a
personal
insult
to
themselves
indignantly
protested
and
wanted
to
turn
them
out
the
workmenthere
were
20
of
them
old
men
and
quite
young
ones
all
of
them
wearied
sunburnt
with
haggard
facesbegan
at
once
to
move
on
through
the
carriage
catching
the
seats
the
walls
and
the
doors
with
their
bags
they
evidently
felt
they
had
offended
in
some
way
and
seemed
ready
to
go
on
indefinitely
wherever
they
were
ordered
to
go
where
are
you
pushing
to
you
fiends
sit
down
here
shouted
another
guard
they
met
voila
encore
des
nouvelles
exclaimed
the
younger
of
the
two
ladies
quite
convinced
that
she
would
attract
nekhludoffs
notice
by
her
good
french
the
other
lady
with
the
bracelets
kept
sniffing
and
making
faces
and
remarked
something
about
how
pleasant
it
was
to
sit
with
smelly
peasants
the
workmen
who
felt
the
joy
and
calm
experienced
by
people
who
have
escaped
some
kind
of
danger
threw
off
their
heavy
bags
with
a
movement
of
their
shoulders
and
stowed
them
away
under
the
seats
the
gardener
had
left
his
own
seat
to
talk
with
taras
and
now
went
back
so
that
there
were
two
unoccupied
seats
opposite
and
one
next
to
taras
three
of
the
workmen
took
these
seats
but
when
nekhludoff
came
up
to
them
in
his
gentlemans
clothing
they
got
so
confused
that
they
rose
to
go
away
but
nekhludoff
asked
them
to
stay
and
himself
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
the
seat
by
the
passage
down
the
middle
of
the
carriage
one
of
the
workmen
a
man
of
about
50
exchanged
a
surprised
and
even
frightened
look
with
a
young
man
that
nekhludoff
instead
of
scolding
and
driving
them
away
as
was
natural
to
a
gentleman
should
give
up
his
seat
to
them
astonished
and
perplexed
them
they
even
feared
that
this
might
have
some
evil
result
for
them
however
they
soon
noticed
that
there
was
no
underlying
plot
when
they
heard
nekhludoff
talking
quite
simply
with
taras
and
they
grew
quiet
and
told
one
of
the
lads
to
sit
down
on
his
bag
and
give
his
seat
to
nekhludoff
at
first
the
elderly
workman
who
sat
opposite
nekhludoff
shrank
and
drew
back
his
legs
for
fear
of
touching
the
gentleman
but
after
a
while
he
grew
quite
friendly
and
in
talking
to
him
and
taras
even
slapped
nekhludoff
on
the
knee
when
he
wanted
to
draw
special
attention
to
what
he
was
saying
he
told
them
all
about
his
position
and
his
work
in
the
peat
bogs
whence
he
was
now
returning
home
he
had
been
working
there
for
two
and
a
half
months
and
was
bringing
home
his
wages
which
only
came
to
10
roubles
since
part
had
been
paid
beforehand
when
he
was
hired
they
worked
as
he
explained
up
to
their
knees
in
water
from
sunrise
to
sunset
with
two
hours
interval
for
dinner
those
who
are
not
used
to
it
find
it
hard
of
course
he
said
but
when
ones
hardened
it
doesnt
matter
if
only
the
food
is
right
at
first
the
food
was
bad
later
the
people
complained
and
they
got
good
food
and
it
was
easy
to
work
then
he
told
them
how
during
28
years
he
went
out
to
work
and
sent
all
his
earnings
home
first
to
his
father
then
to
his
eldest
brother
and
now
to
his
nephew
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
household
on
himself
he
spent
only
two
or
three
roubles
of
the
50
or
60
he
earned
a
year
just
for
luxuriestobacco
and
matches
im
a
sinner
when
tired
i
even
drink
a
little
vodka
sometimes
he
added
with
a
guilty
smile
then
he
told
them
how
the
women
did
the
work
at
home
and
how
the
contractor
had
treated
them
to
half
a
pail
of
vodka
before
they
started
today
how
one
of
them
had
died
and
another
was
returning
home
ill
the
sick
workman
he
was
talking
about
was
in
a
corner
of
the
same
carriage
he
was
a
young
lad
with
a
pale
sallow
face
and
bluish
lips
he
was
evidently
tormented
by
intermittent
fever
nekhludoff
went
up
to
him
but
the
lad
looked
up
with
such
a
severe
and
suffering
expression
that
nekhludoff
did
not
care
to
bother
him
with
questions
but
advised
the
elder
man
to
give
him
quinine
and
wrote
down
the
name
of
the
medicine
he
wished
to
give
him
some
money
but
the
old
workman
said
he
would
pay
for
it
himself
well
much
as
i
have
travelled
i
have
never
met
such
a
gentleman
before
instead
of
punching
your
head
he
actually
gives
up
his
place
to
you
said
the
old
man
to
taras
it
seems
there
are
all
sorts
of
gentlefolk
too
yes
this
is
quite
a
new
and
different
world
thought
nekhludoff
looking
at
these
spare
sinewy
limbs
coarse
homemade
garments
and
sunburnt
kindly
though
wearylooking
faces
and
feeling

thought
nekhludoff
remembering
the
words
of

korchagin
and
all
that
idle
luxurious
world
to
which
the
korchagins
belonged
with
their
petty

interests

and

travelled
by

and
by
steamboats
as
far
as
the
town
of

it
was
only
here
that
nekhludoff
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
permission
for
her
to
continue
the
journey
with
the
political

latter

him
to

been
very
trying
to
maslova
both
morally
and
physically
physically
because
of
the
overcrowding
the
dirt
and
the
disgusting
vermin
which
gave
her
no
peace
morally
because
of
the
equally
disgusting
men
the
men
like
the
vermin
though
they
changed
at
each
haltingplace
were
everywhere
alike
importunate
they
swarmed
round

giving
her
no
rest
among

the

the
habit
of
a
kind
of
cynical
debauch
was
so
firmly
established
that
unless
a
female
prisoner
was
willing
to
utilise
her
position
as
a
woman
she
had
to
be
constantly
on
the
watch
to
be
continually
in
a
state
of
fear
and
strife

very
trying
and
maslova
was
specially
exposed
to
attacks
her
appearance
being
attractive
and
her
past
known
to
every
one
the
decided
resistance
with
which
she
now
met
the
importunity
of
all
the
men
seemed
offensive
to
them
and
awakened
another
feeling
that
of
illwill
towards
her
but
her
position
was
made
a
little
easier
by
her
intimacy
with
theodosia
and
theodosias
husband
who
having
heard
of
the
molestations
his
wife
was
subject
to
had
in
nijni
been
arrested
at
his
own
desire
in
order
to
be
able
to
protect
her
and
was
now
travelling
with
the
gang
as
a
prisoner
maslovas
position
became
much
more
bearable
when
she
was
allowed
to
join
the
political
prisoners
who
were
provided
with
better
accomodations
better
food
and
were
treated
less
rudely
but
besides
all
this
maslovas
condition
was
much
improved
because
among
the
political
prisoners
she
was
no
longer
molested
by
the
men
and
could
live
without
being
reminded
of
that
past
which
she
was
so
anxious
to
forget
but
the
chief
advantage
of
the
change
lay
in
the
fact
that
she
made
the
acquaintance
of
several
persons
who
exercised
a
decided
and
most
beneficial
influence
on
her
character
maslova
was
allowed
to
stop
with
the
political
prisoners
at
all
the
haltingplaces
but
being
a
strong
and
healthy
woman
she
was
obliged
to
march
with
the
criminal
convicts
in
this
way
she
walked
all
the
way
from
tomsk
two
political
prisoners
also
marched
with
the
gang
mary
pavlovna
schetinina
the
girl
with
the
hazel
eyes
who
had
attracted
nekhludoffs
attention
when
he
had
been
to
visit
doukhova
in
prison
and
one
simonson
who
was
on
his
way
to
the
takoutsk
district
the
dishevelled
dark
young
fellow
with
deeplying
eyes
whom
nekhludoff
had
also
noticed
during
that
visit
mary
pavlovna
was
walking
because
she
had
given
her
place
on
the
cart
to
one
of
the
criminals
a
woman
expecting
to
be
confined
and
simonson
because
he
did
not
dare
to
avail
himself
of
a
class
privilege
these
three
always
started
early
in
the
morning
before
the
rest
of
the
political
prisoners
who
followed
later
on
in
the
carts
they
were
ready
to
start
in
this
way
just
outside
a
large
town
where
a
new
convoy
officer
had
taken
charge
of
the
gang
it
was
early
on
a
dull
september
morning
it
kept
raining
and
snowing
alternately
and
the
cold
wind
blew
in
sudden
gusts
the
whole
gang
of
prisoners
consisting
of
four
hundred
men
and
fifty
women
was
already
assembled
in
the
court
of
the
halting
station
some
of
them
were
crowding
round
the
chief
of
the
convoy
who
was
giving
to
specially
appointed
prisoners
money
for
two
days
keep
to
distribute
among
the
rest
while
others
were
purchasing
food
from
women
who
had
been
let
into
the
courtyard
one
could
hear
the
voices
of
the
prisoners
counting
their
money
and
making
their
purchases
and
the
shrill
voices
of
the
women
with
the
food
simonson
in
his
rubber
jacket
and
rubber
overshoes
fastened
with
a
string
over
his
worsted
stockings
he
was
a
vegetarian
and
would
not
wear
the
skin
of
slaughtered
animals
was
also
in
the
courtyard
waiting
for
the
gang
to
start
he
stood
by
the
porch
and
jotted
down
in
his
notebook
a
thought
that
had
occurred
to
him
this
was
what
he
wrote
if
a
bacteria
watched
and
examined
a
human
nail
it
would
pronounce
it
inorganic
matter
and
thus
we
examining
our
globe
and
watching
its
crust
pronounce
it
to
be
inorganic
this
is
incorrect

both
wearing
topboots
and
with
shawls
tied
round
their
heads
came
out
of

building
into

sat

from

among

were
silent

out
and

were

suddenly
the
angry
authoritative
voice
of

the
sound
of

the
crying
of

all
was
silent

moment

then
came
a
hollow
murmur
from

advanced
towards

came
up
to
the
scene
whence
the
noise
proceeded
the
officer
a
sturdy
fellow
with
fair
moustaches
stood
uttering
words
of
foul
and
coarse
abuse
and
rubbing
with
his
left
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
which
he
had
hurt
in
hitting
a

short
for

wiping
his

that

could
not

if

the

happened
to
be
in
a
bad
temper

he
gave
the
troublesome
prisoner
a
beating

by

with

look
of
gloom
on

he
turned
now
to
the
officer
now
to
the

the
little

the

repeated
his

the

among
the
prisoners
grew
louder
all
the

from

they
were
not

came
a
hoarse
voice
from
some
one
in

produced
an

on

looked
at

in
silence

then
said

spite
of
the
hard
conditions
in
which
they
were
placed
life
among
the
political
prisoners
seemed
very
good
to
katusha
after
the
depraved
luxurious
and
effeminate
life
she
had
led
in
town
for
the
last
six
years
and
after
two
months
imprisonment
with
criminal

twenty
miles
they
did
per
day
with
one

rest
after
two
days
marching
strengthened
her
physically
and
the
fellowship
with
her
new
companions
opened
out
to
her
a
life
full
of
interests
such
as
she
had
never
dreamed
of
people
so
wonderful
as
she
expressed
it
as
those
whom
she
was
now
going
with
she
had
not
only
never
met
but
could
not
even
have
imagined
there
now
and
i
cried
when
i
was
sentenced
she
said
why
i
must
thank
god
for
it
all
the
days
of
my
life
i
have
learned
to
know
what
i
never
should
have
found
out
else
the
motives
she
understood
easily
and
without
effort
that
guided
these
people
and
being
of
the
people
fully
sympathised
with
them
she
understood
that
these
persons
were
for
the
people
and
against
the
upper
classes
and
though
themselves
belonging
to
the
upper
classes
had
sacrificed
their
privileges
their
liberty
and
their
lives
for
the
people
this
especially
made
her
value
and
admire
them
she
was
charmed
with
all
the
new
companions
but
particularly
with
mary
pavlovna
and
she
was
not
only
charmed
with
her
but
loved
her
with
a
peculiar
respectful
and
rapturous
love
she
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
this
beautiful
girl
the
daughter
of
a
rich
general
who
could
speak
three
languages
gave
away
all
that
her
rich
brother
sent
her
and
lived
like
the
simplest
working
girl
and
dressed
not
only
simply
but
poorly
paying
no
heed
to
her
appearance
this
trait
and
a
complete
absence
of
coquetry
was
particularly
surprising
and
therefore
attractive
to
maslova
maslova
could
see
that
mary
pavlovna
knew
and
was
even
pleased
to
know
that
she
was
handsome
and
yet
the
effect
her
appearance
had
on
men
was
not
at
all
pleasing
to
her
she
was
even
afraid
of
it
and
felt
an
absolute
disgust
to
all
love
affairs
her
men
companions
knew
it
and
if
they
felt
attracted
by
her
never
permitted
themselves
to
show
it
to
her
but
treated
her
as
they
would
a
man
but
with
strangers
who
often
molested
her
the
great
physical
strength
on
which
she
prided
herself
stood
her
in
good
stead
it
happened
once
she
said
to
katusha
that
a
man
followed
me
in
the
street
and
would
not
leave
me
on
any
account
at
last
i
gave
him
such
a
shaking
that
he
was
frightened
and
ran
away
she
became
a
revolutionary
as
she
said
because
she
felt
a
dislike
to
the
life
of
the
welltodo
from
childhood
up
and
loved
the
life
of
the
common
people
and
she
was
always
being
scolded
for
spending
her
time
in
the
servants
hall
in
the
kitchen
or
the
stables
instead
of
the
drawingroom
and
i
found
it
amusing
to
be
with
cooks
and
the
coachmen
and
dull
with
our
gentlemen
and
ladies
she
said
then
when
i
came
to
understand
things
i
saw
that
our
life
was
altogether
wrong
i
had
no
mother
and
i
did
not
care
for
my
father
and
so
when
i
was
nineteen
i
left
home
and
went
with
a
girl
friend
to
work
as
a
factory
hand
after
she
left
the
factory
she
lived
in
the
country
then
returned
to
town
and
lived
in
a
lodging
where
they
had
a
secret
printing
press
there
she
was
arrested
and
sentenced
to
hard
labour
mary
pavlovna
said
nothing
about
it
herself
but
katusha
heard
from
others
that
mary
pavlovna
was
sentenced
because
when
the
lodging
was
searched
by
the
police
and
one
of
the
revolutionists
fired
a
shot
in
the
dark
she
pleaded
guilty
as
soon
as
she
had
learned
to
know
mary
pavlovna
katusha
noticed
that
whatever
the
conditions
she
found
herself
in
mary
pavlovna
never
thought
of
herself
but
was
always
anxious
to
serve
to
help
some
one
in
matters
small
or
great
one
of
her
present
companions
novodvoroff
said
of
her
that
she
devoted
herself
to
philanthropic
amusements
and
this
was
true
the
interest
of
her
whole
life
lay
in
the
search
for
opportunities
of
serving
others
this
kind
of
amusement
had
become
the
habit
the
business
of
her
life
and
she
did
it
all
so
naturally
that
those
who
knew
her
no
longer
valued
but
simply
expected
it
of
her
when
maslova
first
came
among
them
mary
pavlovna
felt
repulsed
and
disgusted
katusha
noticed
this
but
she
also
noticed
that
having
made
an
effort
to
overcome
these
feelings
mary
pavlovna
became
particularly
tender
and
kind
to
her
the
tenderness
and
kindness
of
so
uncommon
a
being
touched
maslova
so
much
that
she
gave
her
whole
heart
and
unconsciously
accepting
her
views
could
not
help
imitating
her
in
everything
this
devoted
love
of
katusha
touched
mary
pavlovna
in
her
turn
and
she
learned
to
love
katusha
these
women
were
also
united
by
the
repulsion
they
both
felt
to
sexual
love
the
one
loathed
that
kind
of
love
having
experienced
all
its
horrors
the
other
never
having
experienced
it
looked
on
it
as
something
incomprehensible
and
at
the
same
time
as
something
repugnant
and
offensive
to
human
dignity
chapter
iv
simonson
mary
pavlovnas
influence
was
one
that
maslova
submitted
to
because
she
loved
mary
pavlovna
simonson
influenced
her
because
he
loved
her
everybody
lives
and
acts
partly
according
to
his
own
partly
according
to
other
peoples
ideas
this
is
what
constitutes
one
of
the
great
differences
among
men
to
some
thinking
is
a
kind
of
mental
game
they
treat
their
reason
as
if
it
were
a
flywheel
without
a
connecting
strap
and
are
guided
in
their
actions
by
other
peoples
ideas
by
custom
or
laws
while
others
look
upon
their
own
ideas
as
the
chief
motive
power
of
all
their
actions
and
always
listen
to
the
dictates
of
their
own
reason
and
submit
to
it
accepting
other
peoples
opinions
only
on
rare
occasions
and
after
weighing
them
critically
simonson
was
a
man
of
the
latter
sort
he
settled
and
verified
everything
according
to
his
own
reason
and
acted
on
the
decisions
he
arrived
at
when
a
schoolboy
he
made
up
his
mind
that
his
fathers
income
made
as
a
paymaster
in
government
office
was
dishonestly
gained
and
he
told
his
father
that
it
ought
to
be
given
to
the
people
when
his
father
instead
of
listening
to
him
gave
him
a
scolding
he
left
his
fathers
house
and
would
not
make
use
of
his
fathers
means
having
come
to
the
conclusion
that
all
the
existing
misery
was
a
result
of
the
peoples
ignorance
he
joined
the
socialists
who
carried
on
propaganda
among
the
people
as
soon
as
he
left
the
university
and
got
a
place
as
a
village
schoolmaster
he
taught
and
explained
to
his
pupils
and
to
the
peasants
what
he
considered
to
be
just
and
openly
blamed
what
he
thought
unjust
he
was
arrested
and
tried
during
his
trial
he
determined
to
tell
his
judges
that
his
was
a
just
cause
for
which
he
ought
not
to
be
tried
or
punished
when
the
judges
paid
no
heed
to
his
words
but
went
on
with
the
trial
he
decided
not
to
answer
them
and
kept
resolutely
silent
when
they
questioned
him
he
was
exiled
to
the
government
of
archangel
there
he
formulated
a
religious
teaching
which
was
founded
on
the
theory
that
everything
in
the
world
was
alive
that
nothing
is
lifeless
and
that
all
the
objects
we
consider
to
be
without
life
or
inorganic
are
only
parts
of
an
enormous
organic
body
which
we
cannot
compass
a
mans
task
is
to
sustain
the
life
of
that
huge
organism
and
all
its
animate
parts
therefore
he
was
against
war
capital
punishment
and
every
kind
of
killing
not
only
of
human
beings
but
also
of
animals
concerning
marriage
too
he
had
a
peculiar
idea
of
his
own
he
thought
that
increase
was
a
lower
function
of
man
the
highest
function
being
to
serve
the
already
existing
lives
he
found
a
confirmation
of
his
theory
in
the
fact
that
there
were
phacocytes
in
the
blood
celibates
according
to
his
opinion
were
the
same
as
phacocytes
their
function
being
to
help
the
weak
and
the
sickly
particles
of
the
organism
from
the
moment
he
came
to
this
conclusion
he
began
to
consider
himself
as
well
as
mary
pavlovna
as
phacocytes
and
to
live
accordingly
though
as
a
youth
he
had
been
addicted
to
vice
his
love
for
katusha
did
not
infringe
this
conception
because
he
loved
her
platonically
and
such
love
he
considered
could
not
hinder
his
activity
as
a
phacocytes
but
acted
on
the
contrary
as
an
inspiration
not
only
moral
but
also
most
practical
questions
he
decided
in
his
own
way
he
applied
a
theory
of
his
own
to
all
practical
business
had
rules
relating
to
the
number
of
hours
for
rest
and
for
work
to
the
kind
of
food
to
eat
the
way
to
dress
to
heat
and
light
up
the
rooms
with
all
this
simonson
was
very
shy
and
modest
and
yet
when
he
had
once
made
up
his
mind
nothing
could
make
him
waver
and
this
man
had
a
decided
influence
on
maslova
through
his
love
for
her
with
a
womans
instinct
maslova
very
soon
found
out
that
he
loved
her
and
the
fact
that
she
could
awaken
love
in
a
man
of
that
kind
raised
her
in
her
own
estimation
it
was
nekhludoffs
magnanimity
and
what
had
been
in
the
past
that
made
him
offer
to
marry
her
but
simonson
loved
her
such
as
she
was
now
loved
her
simply
because
of
the
love
he
bore
her
and
she
felt
that
simonson
considered
her
to
be
an
exceptional
woman
having
peculiarly
high
moral
qualities
she
did
not
quite
know
what
the
qualities
he
attributed
to
her
were
but
in
order
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
that
he
should
not
be
disappointed
in
her
she
tried
with
all
her
might
to
awaken
in
herself
all
the
highest
qualities
she
could
conceive
and
she
tried
to
be
as
good
as
possible
this
had
begun
while
they
were
still
in
prison
when
on
a
common
visiting
day
she
had
noticed
his
kindly
dark
blue
eyes
gazing
fixedly
at
her
from
under
his
projecting
brow
even
then
she
had
noticed
that
this
was
a
peculiar
man
and
that
he
was
looking
at
her
in
a
peculiar
manner
and
had
also
noticed
the
striking
combination
of
sternnessthe
unruly
hair
and
the
frowning
forehead
gave
him
this
appearancewith
the
childlike
kindness
and
innocence
of
his
look
she
saw
him
again
in
tomsk
where
she
joined
the
political
prisoners
though
they
had
not
uttered
a
word
their
looks
told
plainly
that
they
had
understood
one
another
even
after
that
they
had
had
no
serious
conversation
with
each
other
but
maslova
felt
that
when
he
spoke
in
her
presence
his
words
were
addressed
to
her
and
that
he
spoke
for
her
sake
trying
to
express
himself
as
plainly
as
he
could
but
it
was
when
he
started
walking
with
the
criminal
prisoners
that
they
grew
specially
near
to
one
another
chapter
v
the
political
prisoners
until
they
left
perm
nekhludoff
only
twice
managed
to
see
katusha
once
in
nijni
before
the
prisoners
were
embarked
on
a
barge
surrounded
with
a
wire
netting
and
again
in
perm
in
the
prison
office
at
both
these
interviews
he
found
her
reserved
and
unkind
she
answered
his
questions
as
to
whether
she
was
in
want
of
anything
and
whether
she
was
comfortable
evasively
and
bashfully
and
as
he
thought
with
the
same
feeling
of
hostile
reproach
which
she
had
shown
several
times
before
her
depressed
state
of
mind
which
was
only
the
result
of
the
molestations
from
the
men
that
she
was
undergoing
at
the
time
tormented
nekhludoff
he
feared
lest
influenced
by
the
hard
and
degrading
circumstances
in
which
she
was
placed
on
the
journey
she
should
again
get
into
that
state
of
despair
and
discord
with
her
own
self
which
formerly
made
her
irritable
with
him
and
which
had
caused
her
to
drink
and
smoke
excessively
to
gain
oblivion
but
he
was
unable
to
help
her
in
any
way
during
this
part
of
the
journey
as
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
be
with
her
it
was
only
when
she
joined
the
political
prisoners
that
he
saw
how
unfounded
his
fears
were
and
at
each
interview
he
noticed
that
inner
change
he
so
strongly
desired
to
see
in
her
becoming
more
and
more
marked
the
first
time
they
met
in
tomsk
she
was
again
just
as
she
had
been
when
leaving
moscow
she
did
not
frown
or
become
confused
when
she
saw
him
but
met
him
joyfully
and
simply
thanking
him
for
what
he
had
done
for
her
especially
for
bringing
her
among
the
people
with
whom
she
now
was
after
two
months
marching
with
the
gang
the
change
that
had
taken
place
within
her
became
noticeable
in
her
appearance
she
grew
sunburned
and
thinner
and
seemed
older
wrinkles
appeared
on
her
temples
and
round
her
mouth
she
had
no
ringlets
on
her
forehead
now
and
her
hair
was
covered
with
the
kerchief
in
the
way
it
was
arranged
as
well
as
in
her
dress
and
her
manners
there
was
no
trace
of
coquetry
left
and
this
change
which
had
taken
place
and
was
still
progressing
in
her
made
nekhludoff
very
happy
he
felt
for
her
something
he
had
never
experienced
before
this
feeling
had
nothing
in
common
with
his
first
poetic
love
for
her
and
even
less
with
the
sensual
love
that
had
followed
nor
even
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
duty
fulfilled
not
unmixed
with
selfadmiration
with
which
he
decided
to
marry
her
after
the
trial
the
present
feeling
was
simply
one
of
pity
and
tenderness
he
had
felt
it
when
he
met
her
in
prison
for
the
first
time
and
then
again
when
after
conquering
his
repugnance
he
forgave
her
the
imagined
intrigue
with
the
medical
assistant
in
the
hospital
the
injustice
done
her
had
since
been
discovered
it
was
the
same
feeling
he
now
had
only
with
this
difference
that
formerly
it
was
momentary
and
that
now
it
had
become
permanent
whatever
he
was
doing
whatever
he
was
thinking
now
a
feeling
of
pity
and
tenderness
dwelt
with
him
and
not
only
pity
and
tenderness
for
her
but
for
everybody
this
feeling
seemed
to
have
opened
the
floodgates
of
love
which
had
found
no
outlet
in
nekhludoffs
soul
and
the
love
now
flowed
out
to
every
one
he
met
during
this
journey
nekhludoffs
feelings
were
so
stimulated
that
he
could
not
help
being
attentive
and
considerate
to
everybody
from
the
coachman
and
the
convoy
soldiers
to
the
prison
inspectors
and
governors
whom
he
had
to
deal
with
now
that
maslova
was
among
the
political
prisoners
nekhludoff
could
not
help
becoming
acquainted
with
many
of
them
first
in
ekaterinburg
where
they
had
a
good
deal
of
freedom
and
were
kept
altogether
in
a
large
cell
and
then
on
the
road
when
maslova
was
marching
with
three
of
the
men
and
four
of
the
women
coming
in
contact
with
political
exiles
in
this
way
made
nekhludoff
completely
change
his
mind
concerning
them
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
revolutionary
movement
in
russia
but
especially
since
that
first
of
march
when
alexander
ii
was
murdered
nekhludoff
regarded
the
revolutionists
with
dislike
and
contempt
he
was
repulsed
by
the
cruelty
and
secrecy
of
the
methods
they
employed
in
their
struggles
against
the
government
especially
the
cruel
murders
they
committed
and
their
arrogance
also
disgusted
him
but
having
learned
more
intimately
to
know
them
and
all
they
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
government
he
saw
that
they
could
not
be
other
than
they
were
terrible
and
endless
as
were
the
torments
which
were
inflicted
on
the
criminals
there
was
at
least
some
semblance
of
justice
shown
them
before
and
after
they
were
sentenced
but
in
the
case
of
the
political
prisoners
there
was
not
even
that
semblance
as
nekhludoff
saw
in
the
case
of
sholostova
and
that
of
many
and
many
of
his
new
acquaintances
these
people
were
dealt
with
like
fish
caught
with
a
net
everything
that
gets
into
the
nets
is
pulled
ashore
and
then
the
big
fish
which
are
required
are
sorted
out
and
the
little
ones
are
left
to
perish
unheeded
on
the
shore
having
captured
hundreds
that
were
evidently
guiltless
and
that
could
not
be
dangerous
to
the
government
they
left
them
imprisoned
for
years
where
they
became
consumptive
went
out
of
their
minds
or
committed
suicide
and
kept
them
only
because
they
had
no
inducement
to
set
them
free
while
they
might
be
of
use
to
elucidate
some
question
at
a
judicial
inquiry
safe
in
prison
the
fate
of
these
persons
often
innocent
even
from
the
government
point
of
view
depended
on
the
whim
the
humour
of
or
the
amount
of
leisure
at
the
disposal
of
some
police
officer
or
spy
or
public
prosecutor
or
magistrate
or
governor
or
minister
some
one
of
these
officials
feels
dull
or
inclined
to
distinguish
himself
and
makes
a
number
of
arrests
and
imprisons
or
sets
free
according
to
his
own
fancy
or
that
of
the
higher
authorities
and
the
higher
official
actuated
by
like
motives
according
to
whether
he
is
inclined
to
distinguish
himself
or
to
what
his
relations
to
the
minister
are
exiles
men
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
or
keeps
them
in
solitary
confinement
condemns
them
to
siberia
to
hard
labour
to
death
or
sets
them
free
at
the
request
of
some
lady
they
were
dealt
with
as
in
war
and
they
naturally
employed
the
means
that
were
used
against
them
and
as
the
military
men
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
public
opinion
that
not
only
conceals
from
them
the
guilt
of
their
actions
but
sets
these
actions
up
as
feats
of
heroism
so
these
political
offenders
were
also
constantly
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
public
opinion
which
made
the
cruel
actions
they
committed
in
the
face
of
danger
and
at
the
risk
of
liberty
and
life
and
all
that
is
dear
to
men
seem
not
wicked
but
glorious
actions
nekhludoff
found
in
this
the
explanation
of
the
surprising
phenomenon
that
men
with
the
mildest
characters
who
seemed
incapable
of
witnessing
the
sufferings
of
any
living
creature
much
less
of
inflicting
pain
quietly
prepared
to
murder
men
nearly
all
of
them
considering
murder
lawful
and
just
on
certain
occasions
as
a
means
for
selfdefence
for
the
attainment
of
higher
aims
or
for
the
general
welfare
the
importance
they
attribute
to
their
cause
and
consequently
to
themselves
flowed
naturally
from
the
importance
the
government
attached
to
their
actions
and
the
cruelty
of
the
punishments
it
inflicted
on
them
when
nekhludoff
came
to
know
them
better
he
became
convinced
that
they
were
not
the
rightdown
villains
that
some
imagined
them
to
be
nor
the
complete
heroes
that
others
thought
them
but
ordinary
people
just
the
same
as
others
among
whom
there
were
some
good
and
some
bad
and
some
mediocre
as
there
are
everywhere
there
were
some
among
them
who
had
turned
revolutionists
because
they
honestly
considered
it
their
duty
to
fight
the
existing
evils
but
there
were
also
those
who
chose
this
work
for
selfish
ambitious
motives
the
majority
however
was
attracted
to
the
revolutionary
idea
by
the
desire
for
danger
for
risks
the
enjoyment
of
playing
with
ones
life
which
as
nekhludoff
knew
from
his
military
experiences
is
quite
common
to
the
most
ordinary
people
while
they
are
young
and
full
of
energy
but
wherein
they
differed
from
ordinary
people
was
that
their
moral
standard
was
a
higher
one
than
that
of
ordinary
men
they
considered
not
only
selfcontrol
hard
living
truthfulness
but
also
the
readiness
to
sacrifice
everything
even
life
for
the
common
welfare
as
their
duty
therefore
the
best
among
them
stood
on
a
moral
level
that
is
not
often
reached
while
the
worst
were
far
below
the
ordinary
level
many
of
them
being
untruthful
hypocritical
and
at
the
same
time
selfsatisfied
and
proud
so
that
nekhludoff
learned
not
only
to
respect
but
to
love
some
of
his
new
acquaintances
while
he
remained
more
than
indifferent
to
others
chapter
vi
kryltzoffs
story
nekhludoff
grew
especially
fond
of
kryltzoff
a
consumptive
young
man
condemned
to
hard
labour
who
was
going
with
the
same
gang
as
katusha
nekhludoff
had
made
his
acquaintance
already
in
ekaterinburg
and
talked
with
him
several
times
on
the
road
after
that
once
in
summer
nekhludoff
spent
nearly
the
whole
of
a
day
with
him
at
a
halting
station
and
kryltzoff
having
once
started
talking
told
him
his
story
and
how
he
had
become
a
revolutionist
up
to
the
time
of
his
imprisonment
his
story
was
soon
told
he
lost
his
father
a
rich
landed
proprietor
in
the
south
of
russia
when
still
a
child
he
was
the
only
son
and
his
mother
brought
him
up
he
learned
easily
in
the
university
as
well
as
the
gymnasium
and
was
first
in
the
mathematical
faculty
in
his
year
he
was
offered
a
choice
of
remaining
in
the
university
or
going
abroad
he
hesitated
he
loved
a
girl
and
was
thinking
of
marriage
and
taking
part
in
the
rural
administration
he
did
not
like
giving
up
either
offer
and
could
not
make
up
his
mind
at
this
time
his
fellowstudents
at
the
university
asked
him
for
money
for
a
common
cause
he
did
not
know
that
this
common
cause
was
revolutionary
which
he
was
not
interested
in
at
that
time
but
gave
the
money
from
a
sense
of
comradeship
and
vanity
so
that
it
should
not
be
said
that
he
was
afraid
those
who
received
the
money
were
caught
a
note
was
found
which
proved
that
the
money
had
been
given
by
kryltzoff
he
was
arrested
and
first
kept
at
the
police
station
then
imprisoned
the
prison
where
i
was
put
kryltzoff
went
on
to
relate
he
was
sitting
on
the
high
shelf
bedstead
his
elbows
on
his
knees
with
sunken
chest
the
beautiful
intelligent
eyes
with
which
he
looked
at
nekhludoff
glistening
feverishlythey
were
not
specially
strict
in
that
prison
we
managed
to
converse
not
only
by
tapping
the
wall
but
could
walk
about
the
corridors
share
our
provisions
and
our
tobacco
and
in
the
evenings
we
even
sang
in
chorus
i
had
a
fine
voiceyes
if
it
had
not
been
for
mother
it
would
have
been
all
right
even
pleasant
and
interesting
here
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
famous
petroffhe
afterwards
killed
himself
with
a
piece
of
glass
at
the
fortressand
also
of
others
but
i
was
not
yet
a
revolutionary
i
also
became
acquainted
with
my
neighbours
in
the
cells
next
to
mine
they
were
both
caught
with
polish
proclamations
and
arrested
in
the
same
cause
and
were
tried
for
an
attempt
to
escape
from
the
convoy
when
they
were
being
taken
to
the
railway
station
one
was
a
pole
lozinsky
the
other
a
jew
rozovsky
yes
well
this
rozovsky
was
quite
a
boy
he
said
he
was
seventeen
but
he
looked
fifteenthin
small
active
with
black
sparkling
eyes
and
like
most
jews
very
musical
his
voice
was
still
breaking
and
yet
he
sang
beautifully
yes
i
saw
them
both
taken
to
be
tried
they
were
taken
in
the
morning
they
returned
in
the
evening
and
said
they
were
condemned
to
death
no
one
had
expected
it
their
case
was
so
unimportant
they
only
tried
to
get
away
from
the
convoy
and
had
not
even
wounded
any
one
and
then
it
was
so
unnatural
to
execute
such
a
child
as
rozovsky
and
we
in
prison
all
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
only
done
to
frighten
them
and
would
not
be
confirmed
at
first
we
were
excited
and
then
we
comforted
ourselves
and
life
went
on
as
before
yes
well
one
evening
a
watchman
comes
to
my
door
and
mysteriously
announces
to
me
that
carpenters
had
arrived
and
were
putting
up
the
gallows
at
first
i
did
not
understand
whats
that
what
gallows
but
the
watchman
was
so
excited
that
i
saw
at
once
it
was
for
our
two
i
wished
to
tap
and
communicate
with
my
comrades
but
was
afraid
those
two
would
hear
the
comrades
were
also
silent
evidently
everybody
knew
in
the
corridors
and
in
the
cells
everything
was
as
still
as
death
all
that
evening
they
did
not
tap
the
wall
nor
sing
at
ten
the
watchman
came
again
and
announced
that
a
hangman
had
arrived
from
moscow
he
said
it
and
went
away
i
began
calling
him
back
suddenly
i
hear
rozovsky
shouting
to
me
across
the
corridor
whats
the
matter
why
do
you
call
him
i
answered
something
about
asking
him
to
get
me
some
tobacco
but
he
seemed
to
guess
and
asked
me
why
did
we
not
sing
tonight
why
did
we
not
tap
the
walls
i
do
not
remember
what
i
said
but
i
went
away
so
as
not
to
speak
to
him
yes
it
was
a
terrible
night
i
listened
to
every
sound
all
night
suddenly
towards
morning
i
hear
doors
opening
and
somebody
walkingmany
persons
i
went
up
to
my
window
there
was
a
lamp
burning
in
the
corridor
the
first
to
pass
was
the
inspector
he
was
stout
and
seemed
a
resolute
selfsatisfied
man
but
he
looked
ghastly
pale
downcast
and
seemed
frightened
then
his
assistant
frowning
but
resolute
behind
them
the
watchman
they
passed
my
door
and
stopped
at
the
next
and
i
hear
the
assistant
calling
out
in
a
strange
voice
lozinsky
get
up
and
put
on
clean
linen
yes
then
i
hear
the
creaking
of
the
door
they
entered
into
his
cell
then
i
hear
lozinskys
steps
going
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
corridor
i
could
only
see
the
inspector
he
stood
quite
pale
and
buttoned
and
unbuttoned
his
coat
shrugging
his
shoulders
yes
then
as
if
frightened
of
something
he
moved
out
of
the
way
it
was
lozinsky
who
passed
him
and
came
up
to
my
door
a
handsome
young
fellow
he
was
you
know
of
that
nice
polish
type
broad
shouldered
his
head
covered
with
fine
fair
curly
hair
as
with
a
cap
and
with
beautiful
blue
eyes
so
blooming
so
fresh
so
healthy
he
stopped
in
front
of
my
window
so
that
i
could
see
the
whole
of
his
face
a
dreadful

kryltzoff
have
you
any
cigarettes
i
wished
to
pass
him
some
but
the
assistant
hurriedly
pulled
out
his
cigarette
case
and
passed
it
to
him
he
took
out
one
the
assistant
struck
a
match
and
he
lit
the
cigarette
and
began
to
smoke
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
then
as
if
he
had
remembered
something
he
began
to
speak
it
is
cruel
and
unjust
i
have
committed
no
crime
i
i
saw
something
quiver
in
his
white
young
throat
from
which
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
and
he
stopped
yes
at
that
moment
i
hear
rozovsky
shouting
in
his
fine
jewish
voice
lozinsky
threw
away
the
cigarette
and
stepped
from
the
door
and
rozovsky
appeared
at
the
window
his
childish
face
with
the
limpid
black
eyes
was
red
and
moist
he
also
had
clean
linen
on
the
trousers
were
too
wide
and
he
kept
pulling
them
up
and
trembled
all
over
he
approached
his
pitiful
face
to
my
window
kryltzoff
its
true
that
the
doctor
has
prescribed
cough
mixture
for
me
is
it
not
i
am
not
well
ill
take
some
more
of
the
mixture
no
one
answered
and
he
looked
inquiringly
now
at
me
now
at
the
inspector
what
he
meant
to
say
i
never
made
out
yes
suddenly
the
assistant
again
put
on
a
stern
expression
and
called
out
in
a
kind
of
squeaking
tone
now
then
no
nonsense
let
us
go
rozovsky
seemed
incapable
of
understanding
what
awaited
him
and
hurried
almost
ran
in
front
of
him
all
along
the
corridor
but
then
he
drew
back
and
i
could
hear
his
shrill
voice
and
his
cries
then
the
trampling
of
feet
and
general
hubbub
he
was
shrieking
and
sobbing
the
sounds
came
fainter
and
fainter
and
at
last
the
door
rattled
and
all
was
quiet
yes
and
so
they
hanged
them
throttled
them
both
with
a
rope
a
watchman
another
one
saw
it
done
and
told
me
that
lozinsky
did
not
resist
but
rozovsky
struggled
for
a
long
time
so
that
they
had
to
pull
him
up
on
to
the
scaffold
and
to
force
his
head
into
the
noose
yes
this
watchman
was
a
stupid
fellow
he
said
they
told
me
sir
that
it
would
be
frightful
but
it
was
not
at
all
frightful
after
they
were
hanged
they
only
shrugged
their
shoulders
twice
like
this
he
showed
how
the
shoulders
convulsively
rose
and
fell
then
the
hangman
pulled
a
bit
so
as
to
tighten
the
noose
and
it
was
all
up
and
they
never
budged
and
kryltzoff
repeated
the
watchmans
words
not
at
all
frightful
and
tried
to
smile
but
burst
into
sobs
instead
for
a
long
time
after
that
he
kept
silent
breathing
heavily
and
repressing
the
sobs
that
were
choking
him
from
that
time
i
became
a
revolutionist
yes
he
said
when
he
was
quieter
and
finished
his
story
in
a
few
words
he
belonged
to
the
narodovoltzy
party
and
was
even
at
the
head
of
the
disorganising
group
whose
object
was
to
terrorise
the
government
so
that
it
should
give
up
its
power
of
its
own
accord
with
this
object
he
travelled
to
petersburg
to
kiev
to
odessa
and
abroad
and
was
everywhere
successful
a
man
in
whom
he
had
full
confidence
betrayed
him
he
was
arrested
tried
kept
in
prison
for
two
years
and
condemned
to
death
but
the
sentence
was
mitigated
to
one
of
hard
labour
for
life
he
went
into
consumption
while
in
prison
and
in
the
conditions
he
was
now
placed
he
had
scarcely
more
than
a
few
months
longer
to
live
this
he
knew
but
did
not
repent
of
his
action
but
said
that
if
he
had
another
life
he
would
use
it
in
the
same
way
to
destroy
the
conditions
in
which
such
things
as
he
had
seen
were
possible
this
mans
story
and
his
intimacy
with
him
explained
to
nekhludoff
much
that
he
had
not
previously
understood
chapter
vii
nekhludoff
seeks
an
interview
with
maslova
on
the
day
when
the
convoy
officer
had
the
encounter
with
the
prisoners
at
the
halting
station
about
the
child
nekhludoff
who
had
spent
the
night
at
the
village
inn
woke
up
late
and
was
some
time
writing
letters
to
post
at
the
next
government
town
so
that
he
left
the
inn
later
than
usual
and
did
not
catch
up
with
the
gang
on
the
road
as
he
had
done
previously
but
came
to
the
village
where
the
next
halting
station
was
as
it
was
growing
dusk
having
dried
himself
at
the
inn
which
was
kept
by
an
elderly
woman
who
had
an
extraordinarily
fat
white
neck
he
had
his
tea
in
a
clean
room
decorated
with
a
great
number
of
icons
and
pictures
and
then
hurried
away
to
the
halting
station
to
ask
the
officer
for
an
interview
with
katusha
at
the
last
six
halting
stations
he
could
not
get
the
permission
for
an
interview
from
any
of
the
officers
though
they
had
been
changed
several
times
not
one
of
them
would
allow
nekhludoff
inside
the
halting
stations
so
that
he
had
not
seen
katusha
for
more
than
a
week
this
strictness
was
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
an
important
prison
official
was
expected
to
pass
that
way
now
this
official
had
passed
without
looking
in
at
the
gang
after
all
and
nekhludoff
hoped
that
the
officer
who
had
taken
charge
of
the
gang
in
the
morning
would
allow
him
an
interview
with
the
prisoners
as
former
officers
had
done
the
landlady
offered
nekhludoff
a
trap
to
drive
him
to
the
halting
station
situated
at
the
farther
end
of
the
village
but
nekhludoff
preferred
to
walk
a
young
labourer
a
broadshouldered
young
fellow
of
herculean
dimensions
with
enormous
topboots
freshly
blackened
with
strongly
smelling
tar
offered
himself
as
a
guide
a
dense
mist
obscured
the
sky
and
it
was
so
dark
that
when
the
young
fellow
was
three
steps
in
advance
of
him
nekhludoff
could
not
see
him
unless
the
light
of
some
window
happened
to
fall
on
the
spot
but
he
could
hear
the
heavy
boots
wading
through
the
deep
sticky
slush
after
passing
the
open
place
in
front
of
the
church
and
the
long
street
with
its
rows
of
windows
shining
brightly
in
the
darkness
nekhludoff
followed
his
guide
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
where
it
was
pitch
dark
but
soon
here
too
rays
of
light
streaming
through
the
mist
from
the
lamps
in
the
front
of
the
halting
station
became
discernible
through
the
darkness
the
reddish
spots
of
light
grew
bigger
and
bigger
at
last
the
stakes
of
the
palisade
the
moving
figure
of
the
sentinel
a
post
painted
with
white
and
black
stripes
and
the
sentinels
box
became
visible
the
sentinel
called
his
usual
who
goes
there
as
they
approached
and
seeing
they
were
strangers
treated
them
with
such
severity
that
he
would
not
allow
them
to
wait
by
the
palisade
but
nekhludoffs
guide
was
not
abashed
by
this
severity
hallo
lad
why
so
fierce
you
go
and
rouse
your
boss
while
we
wait
here
the
sentinel
gave
no
answer
but
shouted
something
in
at
the
gate
and
stood
looking
at
the
broadshouldered
young
labourer
scraping
the
mud
off
nekhludoffs
boots
with
a
chip
of
wood
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
from
behind
the
palisade
came
the
hum
of
male
and
female
voices
in
about
three
minutes
more
something
rattled
the
gate
opened
and
a
sergeant
with
his
cloak
thrown
over
his
shoulders
stepped
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
lamplight
the
sergeant
was
not
as
strict
as
the
sentinel
but
he
was
extremely
inquisitive
he
insisted
on
knowing
what
nekhludoff
wanted
the
officer
for
and
who
he
was
evidently
scenting
his
booty
and
anxious
not
to
let
it
escape
nekhludoff
said
he
had
come
on
special
business
and
would
show
his
gratitude
and
would
the
sergeant
take
a
note
for
him
to
the
officer
the
sergeant
took
the
note
nodded
and
went
away
some
time
after
the
gate
rattled
again
and
women
carrying
baskets
boxes
jugs
and
sacks
came
out
loudly
chattering
in
their
peculiar
siberian
dialect
as
they
stepped
over
the
threshold
of
the
gate
none
of
them
wore
peasant
costumes
but
were
dressed
town
fashion
wearing
jackets
and
furlined
cloaks
their
skirts
were
tucked
up
high
and
their
heads
wrapped
up
in
shawls
they
examined
nekhludoff
and
his
guide
curiously
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
one
of
them
showed
evident
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
the
broadshouldered
fellow
and
affectionately
administered
to
him
a
dose
of
siberian
abuse
you
demon
what
are
you
doing
here
the
devil
take
you
she
said
addressing
him
ive
been
showing
this
traveller
here
the
way
answered
the
young
fellow
and
what
have
you
been
bringing
here
dairy
produce
and
i
am
to
bring
more
in
the
morning
the
guide
said
something
in
answer
that
made
not
only
the
women
but
even
the
sentinel
laugh
and
turning
to
nekhludoff
he
said
youll
find
your
way
alone
wont
get
lost
will
you
i
shall
find
it
all
right
when
you
have
passed
the
church
its
the
second
from
the
twostoried
house
oh
and
here
take
my
staff
he
said
handing
the
stick
he
was
carrying
and
which
was
longer
than
himself
to
nekhludoff
and
splashing
through
the
mud
with
his
enormous
boots
he
disappeared
in
the
darkness
together
with
the
women
his
voice
mingling
with
the
voices
of
the
women
was
still
audible
through
the
fog
when
the
gate
again
rattled
and
the
sergeant
appeared
and
asked
nekhludoff
to
follow
him
to
the
officer
chapter
viii
nekhludoff
and
the
officer
this
halting
station
like
all
such
stations
along
the
siberian
road
was
surrounded
by
a
courtyard
fenced
in
with
a
palisade
of
sharppointed
stakes
and
consisted
of
three
onestoried
houses
one
of
them
the
largest
with
grated
windows
was
for
the
prisoners
another
for
the
convoy
soldiers
and
the
third
in
which
the
office
was
for
the
officers
there
were
lights
in
the
windows
of
all
the
three
houses
and
like
all
such
lights
they
promised
here
in
a
specially
deceptive
manner
something
cosy
inside
the
walls
lamps
were
burning
before
the
porches
of
the
houses
and
about
five
lamps
more
along
the
walls
lit
up
the
yard
the
sergeant
led
nekhludoff
along
a
plank
which
lay
across
the
yard
up
to
the
porch
of
the
smallest
of
the
houses
when
he
had
gone
up
the
three
steps
of
the
porch
he
let
nekhludoff
pass
before
him
into
the
anteroom
in
which
a
small
lamp
was
burning
and
which
was
filled
with
smoky
fumes
by
the
stove
a
soldier
in
a
coarse
shirt
with
a
necktie
and
black
trousers
and
with
one
topboot
on
stood
blowing
the
charcoal
in
a
somovar
using
the
other
boot
as
bellows
the
long
boots
worn
in
russia
have
concertinalike
sides
and
when
held
to
the
chimney
of
the
somovar
can
be
used
instead
of
bellows
to
make
the
charcoal
inside
burn
up
when
he
saw
nekhludoff
the
soldier
left
the
somovar
and
helped
him
off
with
his
waterproof
then
went
into
the
inner
room
he
has
come
your
honour
well
ask
him
in
came
an
angry
voice
go
in
at
the
door
said
the
soldier
and
went
back
to
the
somovar
in
the
next
room
an
officer
with
fair
moustaches
and
a
very
red
face
dressed
in
an
austrian
jacket
that
closely
fitted
his
broad
chest
and
shoulders
sat
at
a
covered
table
on
which
were
the
remains
of
his
dinner
and
two
bottles
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
tobacco
and
some
very
strong
cheap
scent
in
the
warm
room
on
seeing
nekhludoff
the
officer
rose
and
gazed
ironically
and
suspiciously
as
it
seemed
at
the
newcomer
what
is
it
you
want
he
asked
and
not
waiting
for
a
reply
he
shouted
through
the
open
door
bernoff
the
somovar
what
are
you
about
coming
at
once
youll
get
it
at
once
so
that
youll
remember
it
shouted
the
officer
and
his
eyes
flashed
im
coming
shouted
the
soldier
and
brought
in
the
somovar
nekhludoff
waited
while
the
soldier
placed
the
somovar
on
the
table
when
the
officer
had
followed
the
soldier
out
of
the
room
with
his
cruel
little
eyes
looking
as
if
they
were
aiming
where
best
to
hit
him
he
made
the
tea
got
the
fourcornered
decanter
out
of
his
travelling
case
and
some
albert
biscuits
and
having
placed
all
this
on
the
cloth
he
again
turned
to
nekhludoff
well
how
can
i
be
of
service
to
you
i
should
like
to
be
allowed
to
visit
a
prisoner
said
nekhludoff
without
sitting
down
a
political
one
thats
forbidden
by
the
law
said
the
officer
the
woman
i
mean

not
a
political
prisoner
said
nekhludoff
yes
but
pray
take
a
scat
said
the
officer
nekhludoff
sat
down
she
is
not
a
political
one
but
at
my
request
she
has
been
allowed
by
the
higher
authorities
to
join
the
political
prisoners
oh
yes
i
know
interrupted
the
other
a
little
dark
one
well
yes
that
can
be
managed
wont
you
smoke
he
moved
a
box
of
cigarettes
towards
nekhludoff
and
having
carefully
poured
out
two
tumblers
of
tea
he
passed
one
to
nekhludoff
if
you
please
he
said
thank
you
i
should
like
to
see
the
night
is
long
youll
have
plenty
of
time
i
shall
order
her
to
be
sent
out
to
you
but
could
i
not
see
her
where
she
is
why
need
she
be
sent
for
nekhludoff
said
in
to
the
political
prisoners
it
is
against
the
law
i
have
been
allowed
to
go
in
several
times
if
there
is
any
danger
of
my
passing
anything
in
to
them
i
could
do
it
through
her
just
as
well
oh
no
she
would
be
searched
said
the
officer
and
laughed
in
an
unpleasant
manner
well
why
not
search
me
all
right
well
manage
without
that
said
the
officer
opening
the
decanter
and
holding
it
out
towards
nekhludoffs
tumbler
of
tea
may
i
no
well
just
as
you
like
when
you
are
living
here
in
siberia
you
are
too
glad
to
meet
an
educated
person
our
work
as
you
know
is
the
saddest
and
when
one
is
used
to
better
things
it
is
very
hard
the
idea
they
have
of
us
is
that
convoy
officers
are
coarse
uneducated
men
and
no
one
seems
to
remember
that
we
may
have
been
born
for
a
very
different
position
this
officers
red
face
his
scents
his
rings
and
especially
his
unpleasant
laughter
disgusted
nekhludoff
very
much
but
today
as
during
the
whole
of
his
journey
he
was
in
that
serious
attentive
state
which
did
not
allow
him
to
behave
slightingly
or
disdainfully
towards
any
man
but
made
him
feel
the
necessity
of
speaking
to
every
one
entirely
as
he
expressed
to
himself
this
relation
to
men
when
he
had
heard
the
officer
and
understood
his
state
of
mind
he
said
in
a
serious
manner
i
think
that
in
your
position
too
some
comfort
could
be
found
in
helping
the
suffering
people
he
said
what
are
their
sufferings
you
dont
know
what
these
people
are
they
are
not
special
people
said
nekhludoff
they
are
just
such
people
as
others
and
some
of
them
are
quite
innocent
of
course
there
are
all
sorts
among
them
and
naturally
one
pities
them
others
wont
let
anything
off
but
i
try
to
lighten
their
condition
where
i
can
its
better
that
i
should
suffer
but
not
they
others
keep
to
the
law
in
every
detail
even
as
far
as
to
shoot
but
i
show
pity
may
itake
another
he
said
and
poured
out
another
tumbler
of
tea
for
nekhludoff
and
who
is
she
this
woman
that
you
want
to
see
he
asked
it
is
an
unfortunate
woman
who
got
into
a
brothel
and
was
there
falsely
accused
of
poisoning
and
she
is
a
very
good
woman
nekhludoff
answered
the
officer
shook
his
head
yes
it
does
happen
i
can
tell
you
about
a
certain
emma
who
lived
in
kasan
she
was
a
hungarian
by
birth
but
she
had
quite
persian
eyes
he
continued
unable
to
restrain
a
smile
at
the
recollection
there
was
so
much
chic
about
her
that
a
countess
nekhludoff
interrupted
the
officer
and
returned
to
the
former
topic
of
conversation
i
think
that
you
could
lighten
the
condition
of
the
people
while
they
are
in
your
charge
and
in
acting
that
way
i
am
sure
you
would
find
great
joy
said
nekhludoff
trying
to
pronounce
as
distinctly
as
possible
as
he
might
if
talking
to
a
foreigner
or
a
child
the
officer
looked
at
nekhludoff
impatiently
waiting
for
him
to
stop
so
as
to
continue
the
tale
about
the
hungarian
with
persian
eyes
who
evidently
presented
herself
very
vividly
to
his
imagination
and
quite
absorbed
his
attention
yes
of
course
this
is
all
quite
true
he
said
and
i
do
pity
them
but
i
should
like
to
tell
you
about
emma
what
do
you
think
she
did
it
does
not
interest
me
said
nekhludoff
and
i
will
tell
you
straight
that
though
i
was
myself
very
different
at
one
time
i
now
hate
that
kind
of
relation
to
women
the
officer
gave
nekhludoff
a
frightened
look
wont
you
take
some
more
tea
he
said
no
thank
you
bernoff
the
officer
called
take
the
gentleman
to
vakouloff
tell
him
to
let
him
into
the
separate
political
room
he
may
remain
there
till
the
inspection
chapter
ix
the
political
prisoners
accompanied
by
the
orderly
nekhludoff
went
out
into
the
courtyard
which
was
dimly
lit
up
by
the
red
light
of
the
lamps
where
to
asked
the
convoy
sergeant
addressing
the
orderly
into
the
separate
cell
no
5
you
cant
pass
here
the
boss
has
gone
to
the
village
and
taken
the
keys
well
then
pass
this
way
the
soldier
led
nekhludoff
along
a
board
to
another
entrance
while
still
in
the
yard
nekhludoff
could
hear
the
din
of
voices
and
general
commotion
going
on
inside
as
in
a
beehive
when
the
bees
are
preparing
to
swarm
but
when
he
came
nearer
and
the
door
opened
the
din
grew
louder
and
changed
into
distinct
sounds
of
shouting
abuse
and
laughter
he
heard
the
clatter
of
chairs
and
smelt
the
wellknown
foul
air
this
din
of
voices
and
the
clatter
of
the
chairs
together
with
the
close
smell
always
flowed
into
one
tormenting
sensation
and
produced
in
nekhludoff
a
feeling
of
moral
nausea
which
grew
into
physical
sickness
the
two
feelings
mingling
with
and
heightening
each
other
the
first
thing
nekhludoff
saw
on
entering
was
a
large
stinking
tub
a
corridor
into
which
several
doors
opened
led
from
the
entrance
the
first
was
the
family
room
then
the
bachelors
room
and
at
the
very
end
two
small
rooms
were
set
apart
for
the
political
prisoners
the
buildings
which
were
arranged
to
hold
one
hundred
and
fifty
prisoners
now
that
there
were
four
hundred
and
fifty
inside
were
so
crowded
that
the
prisoners
could
not
all
get
into
the
rooms
but
filled
the
passage
too
some
were
sitting
or
lying
on
the
floor
some
were
going
out
with
empty
teapots
or
bringing
them
back
filled
with
boiling
water
among
the
latter
was
taras
he
overtook
nekhludoff
and
greeted
him
affectionately
the
kind
face
of
taras
was
disfigured
by
dark
bruises
on
his
nose
and
under
his
eye
what
has
happened
to
you
asked
nekhludoff
yes
something
did
happen
taras
said
with
a
smile
all
because
of
the
woman
added
a
prisoner
who
followed
taras
hes
had
a
row
with
blind
fedka
and
hows
theodosia
shes
all
right
here
i
am
bringing
her
the
water
for
her
tea
taras
answered
and
went
into
the
family
room
nekhludoff
looked
in
at
the
door
the
room
was
crowded
with
women
and
men
some
of
whom
were
on
and
some
under
the
bedsteads
it
was
full
of
steam
from
the
wet
clothes
that
were
drying
and
the
chatter
of
womens
voices
was
unceasing
the
next
door
led
into
the
bachelors
room
this
room
was
still
more
crowded
even
the
doorway
and
the
passage
in
front
of
it
were
blocked
by
a
noisy
crowd
of
men
in
wet
garments
busy
doing
or
deciding
something
or
other
the
convoy
sergeant
explained
that
it
was
the
prisoner
appointed
to
buy
provisions
paying
off
out
of
the
food
money
what
was
owing
to
a
sharper
who
had
won
from
or
lent
money
to
the
prisoners
and
receiving
back
little
tickets
made
of
playing
cards
when
they
saw
the
convoy
soldier
and
a
gentleman
those
who
were
nearest
became
silent
and
followed
them
with
looks
of
illwill
among
them
nekhludoff
noticed
the
criminal
fedoroff
whom
he
knew
and
who
always
kept
a
miserable
lad
with
a
swelled
appearance
and
raised
eyebrows
beside
him
and
also
a
disgusting
noseless
pockmarked
tramp
who
was
notorious
among
the
prisoners
because
he
killed
his
comrade
in
the
marshes
while
trying
to
escape
and
had
as
it
was
rumoured
fed
on
his
flesh
the
tramp
stood
in
the
passage
with
his
wet
cloak
thrown
over
one
shoulder
looking
mockingly
and
boldly
at
nekhludoff
and
did
not
move
out
of
the
way
nekhludoff
passed
him
by
though
this
kind
of
scene
had
now
become
quite
familiar
to
him
though
he
had
during
the
last
three
months
seen
these
four
hundred
criminal
prisoners
over
and
over
again
in
many
different
circumstances
in
the
heat
enveloped
in
clouds
of
dust
which
they
raised
as
they
dragged
their
chained
feet
along
the
road
and
at
the
resting
places
by
the
way
where
the
most
horrible
scenes
of
barefaced
debauchery
had
occurred
yet
every
time
he
came
among
them
and
felt
their
attention
fixed
upon
him
as
it
was
now
shame
and
consciousness
of
his
sin
against
them
tormented
him
to
this
sense
of
shame
and
guilt
was
added
an
unconquerable
feeling
of
loathing
and
horror
he
knew
that
placed
in
a
position
such
as
theirs
they
could
not
be
other
than
they
were
and
yet
he
was
unable
to
stifle
his
disgust
its
well
for
them
donothings
nekhludoff
heard
some
one
say
in
a
hoarse
voice
as
he
approached
the
room
of
the
political
prisoners
then
followed
a
word
of
obscene
abuse
and
spiteful
mocking
laughter

when
they
had
passed
the
bachelors
room
the
sergeant
who
accompanied
nekhludoff
left
him
promising
to
come
for
him
before
the
inspection
would
take
place
as
soon
as
the
sergeant
was
gone
a
prisoner
quickly
stepping
with
his
bare
feet
and
holding
up
the
chains
came
close
up
to
nekhludoff
enveloping
him
in
the
strong
acid
smell
of
perspiration
and
said
in
a
mysterious
whisper
help
the
lad
sir
hes
got
into
an
awful
mess
been
drinking
today
hes
given
his
name
as
karmanoff
at
the
inspection
take
his
part
sir
we
dare
not
or
theyll
kill
us
and
looking
uneasily
round
he
turned
away
this
is
what
had
happened
the
criminal
kalmanoff
had
persuaded
a
young
fellow
who
resembled
him
in
appearance
and
was
sentenced
to
exile
to
change
names
with
him
and
go
to
the
mines
instead
of
him
while
he
only
went
to
exile
nekhludoff
knew
all
this
some
convict
had
told
him
about
this
exchange
the
week
before
he
nodded
as
a
sign
that
he
understood
and
would
do
what
was
in
his
power
and
continued
his
way
without
looking
round
nekhludoff
knew
this
convict
and
was
surprised
by
his
action
when
in
ekaterinburg
the
convict
had
asked
nekhludoff
to
get
a
permission
for
his
wife
to
follow
him
the
convict
was
a
man
of
medium
size
and
of
the
most
ordinary
peasant
type
about
thirty
years
old
he
was
condemned
to
hard
labour
for
an
attempt
to
murder
and
rob
his
name
was
makar
devkin
his
crime
was
a
very
curious
one
in
the
account
he
gave
of
it
to
nekhludoff
he
said
it
was
not
his
but
his
devils
doing
he
said
that
a
traveller
had
come
to
his
fathers
house
and
hired
his
sledge
to

hundred

when
he
had
heard

makar
went
out
into
the
yard
and
put
an
axe
into
the
sledge
under
the
straw
and
i
did
not
myself

why
i
was
taking

he
and
i
took
it
we
got
in
and
started
we
drove
along
all
right
i
even
forgot
about
the
axe
well
we
were
getting
near
the
village
only
about
four
miles
more
to
go
the
way
from
the
crossroad
to
the
high
road
was
up
hill
and
i
got
out
i
walked
behind
the
sledge
and
he
whispers
to
me
what
are
you
thinking
about
when
you
get
to
the
top
of
the
hill
you
will
meet
people
along
the
highway
and
then
there
will
be
the
village
he
will
carry
the
money
away
if
you
mean
to
do
it
nows
the
time
i
stooped
over
the
sledge
as
if
to
arrange
the
straw
and
the
axe
seemed
to
jump
into
my
hand
of
itself
the
man
turned
round
what
are
you
doing
i
lifted
the
axe
and
tried
to
knock
him
down
but
he
was
quick
jumped
out
and
took
hold
of
my
hands
what
are
you
doing
you
villain
he
threw
me
down
into
the
snow
and
i
did
not
even
struggle
but
gave
in
at
once
he
bound
my
arms
with
his
girdle
and
threw
me
into
the
sledge
and
took
me
straight
to
the
police
station
i
was
imprisoned
and
tried
the
commune
gave
me
a
good
character
said
that
i
was
a
good
man
and
that
nothing
wrong
had
been
noticed
about
me
the
masters
for
whom
i
worked
also
spoke
well
of
me
but
we
had
no
money
to
engage
a
lawyer
and
so
i
was
condemned
to
four
years
hard
labour
it
was
this
man
who
wishing
to
save
a
fellowvillager
knowing
that
he
was
risking
his
life
thereby
told
nekhludoff
the
prisoners
secret
for
doing
which
if
found
out
he
should
certainly
be
throttled
chapter
xi
maslova
and
her
companions
the
political
prisoners
were
kept
in
two
small
rooms
the
doors
of
which
opened
into
a
part
of
the
passage
partitioned
off
from
the
rest
the
first
person
nekhludoff
saw
on
entering
into
this
part
of
the
passage
was
simonson
in
his
rubber
jacket
and
with
a
log
of
pine
wood
in
his
hands
crouching
in
front
of
a
stove
the
door
of
which
trembled
drawn
in
by
the
heat
inside
when
he
saw
nekhludoff
he
looked
up
at
him
from
under
his
protruding
brow
and
gave
him
his
hand
without
rising
i
am
glad
you
have
come
i
want
to
speak
to
you
he
said
looking
nekhludoff
straight
in
the
eyes
with
an
expression
of
importance
yes
what
is
it
nekhludoff
asked
it
will
do
later
on
i
am
busy
just
now
and
simonson
turned
again
towards
the
stove
which
he
was
heating
according
to
a
theory
of
his
own
so
as
to
lose
as
little
heat
energy
as
possible
nekhludoff
was
going
to
enter
in
at
the
first
door
when
maslova
stooping
and
pushing
a
large
heap
of
rubbish
and
dust
towards
the
stove
with
a
handleless
birch
broom
came
out
of
the
other
she
had
a
white
jacket
on
her
skirt
was
tucked
up
and
a
kerchief
drawn
down
to
her
eyebrows
protected
her
hair
from
the
dust
when
she
saw
nekhludoff
she
drew
herself
up
flushing
and
animated
put
down
the
broom
wiped
her
hands
on
her
skirt
and
stopped
right
in
front
of
him
you
are
tidying
up
the
apartments
i
see
said
nekhludoff
shaking
hands
yes
my
old
occupation
and
she
smiled
but
the
dirt
you
cant
imagine
what
it
is
we
have
been
cleaning
and
cleaning
well
is
the
plaid
dry
she
asked
turning
to
simonson
almost
simonson
answered
giving
her
a
strange
look
which
struck
nekhludoff
all
right
ill
come
for
it
and
will
bring
the
cloaks
to
dry
our
people
are
all
in
here
she
said
to
nekhludoff
pointing
to
the
first
door
as
she
went
out
of
the
second
nekhludoff
opened
the
door
and
entered
a
small
room
dimly
lit
by
a
little
metal
lamp
which
was
standing
low
down
on
the
shelf
bedstead
it
was
cold
in
the
room
and
there
was
a
smell
of
the
dust
which
had
not
had
time
to
settle
damp
and
tobacco
smoke
only
those
who
were
close
to
the
lamp
were
clearly
visible
the
bedsteads
were
in
the
shade
and
wavering
shadows
glided
over
the
walls
two
men
appointed
as
caterers
who
had
gone
to
fetch
boiling
water
and
provisions
were
away
most
of
the
political
prisoners
were
gathered
together
in
the
small
room
there
was
nekhludoffs
old
acquaintance
vera
doukhova
with
her
large
frightened
eyes
and
the
swollen
vein
on
her
forehead
in
a
grey
jacket
with
short
hair
and
thinner
and
yellower
than
ever
she
had
a
newspaper
spread
out
in
front
of
her
and
sat
rolling
cigarettes
with
a
jerky
movement
of
her
hands
emily
rintzeva
whom
nekhludoff
considered
to
be
the
pleasantest
of
the
political
prisoners
was
also
here
she
looked
after
the
housekeeping
and
managed
to
spread
a
feeling
of
home
comfort
even
in
the
midst
of
the
most
trying
surroundings
she
sat
beside
the
lamp
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
wiping
cups
and
mugs
and
placing
them
with
her
deft
red
and
sunburnt
hands
on
a
cloth
that
was
spread
on
the
bedstead
rintzeva
was
a
plainlooking
young
woman
with
a
clever
and
mild
expression
of
face
which
when
she
smiled
had
a
way
of
suddenly
becoming
merry
animated
and
captivating
it
was
with
such
a
smile
that
she
now
welcomed
nekhludoff
why
we
thought
you
had
gone
back
to
russia
she
said
here
in
a
dark
corner
was
also
mary
pavlovna
busy
with
a
little
fairhaired
girl
who
kept
prattling
in
her
sweet
childish
accents
how
nice
that
you
have
come
she
said
to
nekhludoff
have
you
seen
katusha
and
we
have
a
visitor
here
and
she
pointed
to
the
little
girl
here
was
also
anatole
kryltzoff
with
felt
boots
on
sitting
in
a
far
corner
with
his
feet
under
him
doubled
up
and
shivering
his
arms
folded
in
the
sleeves
of
his
cloak
and
looking
at
nekhludoff
with
feverish
eyes
nekhludoff
was
going
up
to
him
but
to
the
right
of
the
door
a
man
with
spectacles
and
reddish
curls
dressed
in
a
rubber
jacket
sat
talking
to
the
pretty
smiling
grabetz
this
was
the
celebrated
revolutionist
novodvoroff
nekhludoff
hastened
to
greet
him
he
was
in
a
particular
hurry
about
it
because
this
man
was
the
only
one
among
all
the
political
prisoners
whom
he
disliked
novodvoroffs
eyes
glistened
through
his
spectacles
as
he
looked
at
nekhludoff
and
held
his
narrow
hand
out
to
him
well
are
you
having
a
pleasant
journey
he
asked
with
apparent
irony
yes
there
is
much
that
is
interesting
nekhludoff
answered
as
if
he
did
not
notice
the
irony
but
took
the
question
for
politeness
and
passed
on
to
kryltzoff
though
nekhludoff
appeared
indifferent
he
was
really
far
from
indifferent
and
these
words
of
novodvoroff
showing
his
evident
desire
to
say
or
do
something
unpleasant
interfered
with
the
state
of
kindness
in
which
nekhludoff
found
himself
and
he
felt
depressed
and
sad
well
how
are
you
he
asked
pressing
kryltzoffs
cold
and
trembling
hand
pretty
well
only
i
cannot
get
warm
i
got
wet
through
kryltzoff
answered
quickly
replacing
his
hands
into
the
sleeves
of
his
cloak
and
here
it
is
also
beastly
cold
there
look
the
windowpanes
are
broken
and
he
pointed
to
the
broken
panes
behind
the
iron
bars
and
how
are
you
why
did
you
not
come
i
was
not
allowed
to
the
authorities
were
so
strict
but
today
the
officer
is
lenient
lenient
indeed
kryltzoff
remarked
ask
mary
what
she
did
this
morning
mary
pavlovna
from
her
place
in
the
corner
related
what
had
happened
about
the
little
girl
that
morning
when
they
left
the
halting
station
i
think
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
make
a
collective
protest
said
vera
doukhova
in
a
determined
tone
and
yet
looking
now
at
one
now
at
another
with
a
frightened
undecided
look
valdemar
simonson
did
protest
but
that
is
not
sufficient
what
protest
muttered
kryltzoff
cross
and
frowning
her
want
of
simplicity
artificial
tone
and
nervousness
had
evidently
been
irritating
him
for
a
long
time
are
you
looking
for
katusha
he
asked
addressing
nekhludoff
she
is
working
all
the
time
she
has
cleaned
this
the
mens
room
and
now
she
has
gone
to
clean
the
womens
only
it
is
not
possible
to
clean
away
the
fleas
and
what
is
mary
doing
there
he
asked
nodding
towards
the
corner
where
mary
pavlovna
sat
she
is
combing
out
her
adopted
daughters
hair
replied
rintzeva
but
wont
she
let
the
insects
loose
on
us
asked
kryltzoff
no
no
i
am
very
careful
she
is
a
clean
little
girl
now
you
take
her
said
mary
turning
to
rintzeva
while
i
go
and
help
katusha
and
i
will
also
bring
him
his
plaid
rintzeva
took
the
little
girl
on
her
lap
pressing
her
plump
bare
little
arms
to
her
bosom
with
a
mothers
tenderness
and
gave
her
a
bit
of
sugar
as
mary
pavlovna
left
the
room
two
men
came
in
with
boiling
water
and
provisions
chapter
xii
nabatoff
and
markel
one
of
the
men
who
came
in
was
a
short
thin
young
man
who
had
a
clothcovered
sheepskin
coat
on
and
high
topboots
he
stepped
lightly
and
quickly
carrying
two
steaming
teapots
and
holding
a
loaf
wrapped
in
a
cloth
under
his
arm
well
so
our
prince
has
put
in
an
appearance
again
he
said
as
he
placed
the
teapot
beside
the
cups
and
handed
the
bread
to
rintzeva
we
have
bought
wonderful
things
he
continued
as
he
took
off
his
sheepskin
and
flung
it
over
the
heads
of
the
others
into
the
corner
of
the
bedstead
markel
has
bought
milk
and
eggs
why
well
have
a
regular
ball
today
and
rintzeva
is
spreading
out
her
aesthetic
cleanliness
he
said
and
looked
with
a
smile
at
rintzeva
and
now
she
will
make
the
tea
the
whole
presence
of
this
manhis
motion
his
voice
his
lookseemed
to
breathe
vigour
and
merriment
the
other
newcomer
was
just
the
reverse
of
the
first
he
looked
despondent
and
sad
he
was
short
bony
had
very
prominent
cheek
bones
a
sallow
complexion
thin
lips
and
beautiful
greenish
eyes
rather
far
apart
he
wore
an
old
wadded
coat
topboots
and
goloshes
and
was
carrying
two
pots
of
milk
and
two
round
boxes
made
of
birch
bark
which
he
placed
in
front
of
rintzeva
he
bowed
to
nekhludoff
bending
only
his
neck
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
him
then
having
reluctantly
given
him
his
damp
hand
to
shake
he
began
to
take
out
the
provisions
both
these
political
prisoners
were
of
the
people
the
first
was
nabatoff
a

the
second
markel

a

hand
markel
did
not
come
among

till
he
was
quite
a
man
nabatoff
only
eighteen
after
leaving
the
village
school
owing
to
his
exceptional
talents
nabatoff
entered
the
gymnasium
and
maintained
himself
by
giving
lessons
all
the
time
he
studied
there
and
obtained
the
gold
medal
he
did
not
go
to
the
university
because
while
still
in
the
seventh
class
of
the
gymnasium
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
among
the
people
and
enlighten
his
neglected
brethren
this
he
did
first
getting
the
place
of
a
government
clerk
in
a
large
village
he
was
soon
arrested
because
he
read
to
the
peasants
and
arranged
a
cooperative
industrial
association
among
them
they
kept
him
imprisoned
for
eight
months
and
then
set
him
free
but
he
remained
under
police
supervision
as
soon
as
he
was
liberated
he
went
to
another
village
got
a
place
as
schoolmaster
and
did
the
same
as
he
had
done
in
the
first
village
he
was
again
taken
up
and
kept
fourteen
months
in
prison
where
his
convictions
became
yet
stronger
after
that
he
was
exiled
to
the
perm
government
from
where
he
escaped
then
he
was
put
to
prison
for
seven
months
and
after
that
exiled
to
archangel
there
he
refused
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
that
was
required
of
them
and
was
condemned
to
be
exiled
to
the
takoutsk
government
so
that
half
his
life
since
he
reached
manhood
was
passed
in
prison
and
exile
all
these
adventures
did
not
embitter
him
nor
weaken
his
energy
but
rather
stimulated
it
he
was
a
lively
young
fellow
with
a
splendid
digestion
always
active
gay
and
vigorous
he
never
repented
of
anything
never
looked
far
ahead
and
used
all
his
powers
his
cleverness
his
practical
knowledge
to
act
in
the
present
when
free
he
worked
towards
the
aim
he
had
set
himself
the
enlightening
and
the
uniting
of
the
working
men
especially
the
country
labourers
when
in
prison
he
was
just
as
energetic
and
practical
in
finding
means
to
come
in
contact
with
the
outer
world
and
in
arranging
his
own
life
and
the
life
of
his
group
as
comfortably
as
the
conditions
would
allow
above
all
things
he
was
a
communist
he
wanted
as
it
seemed
to
him
nothing
for
himself
and
contented
himself
with
very
little
but
demanded
very
much
for
the
group
of
his
comrades
and
could
work
for
it
either
physically
or
mentally
day
and
night
without
sleep
or
food
as
a
peasant
he
had
been
industrious
observant
clever
at
his
work
and
naturally
selfcontrolled
polite
without
any
effort
and
attentive
not
only
to
the
wishes
but
also
the
opinions
of
others
his
widowed
mother
an
illiterate
superstitious
old
peasant
woman
was
still
living
and
nabatoff
helped
her
and
went
to
see
her
while
he
was
free
during
the
time
he
spent
at
home
he
entered
into
all
the
interests
of
his
mothers
life
helped
her
in
her
work
and
continued
his
intercourse
with
former
playfellows
smoked
cheap
tobacco
with
them
in
socalled
dogs
feet
a
kind
of
cigarette
that
the
peasants
smoke
made
of
a
bit
of
paper
and
bent
at
one
end
into
a
hook
took
part
in
their
fist
fights
and
explained
to
them
how
they
were
all
being
deceived
by
the
state
and
how
they
ought
to
disentangle
themselves
out
of
the
deception
they
were
kept
in
when
he
thought
or
spoke
of
what
a
revolution
would
do
for
the
people
he
always
imagined
this
people
from
whom
he
had
sprung
himself
left
in
very
nearly
the
same
conditions
as
they
were
in
only
with
sufficient
land
and
without
the
gentry
and
without
officials
the
revolution
according
to
him
and
in
this
he
differed
from
novodvoroff
and
novodvoroffs
follower
markel
kondratieff
should
not
alter
the
elementary
forms
of
the
life
of
the
people
should
not
break
down
the
whole
edifice
but
should
only
alter
the
inner
walls
of
the
beautiful
strong
enormous
old
structure
he
loved
so
dearly
he
was
also
a
typical
peasant
in
his
views
on
religion
never
thinking
about
metaphysical
questions
about
the
origin
of
all
origin
or
the
future
life
god
was
to
him
as
also
to
arago
an
hypothesis
which
he
had
had
no
need
of
up
to
now
he
had
no
business
with
the
origin
of
the
world
whether
moses
or
darwin
was
right
darwinism
which
seemed
so
important
to
his
fellows
was
only
the
same
kind
of
plaything
of
the
mind
as
the
creation
in
six
days
the
question
how
the
world
had
originated
did
not
interest
him
just
because
the
question
how
it
would
be
best
to
live
in
this
world
was
ever
before
him
he
never
thought
about
future
life
always
bearing
in
the
depth
of
his
soul
the
firm
and
quiet
conviction
inherited
from
his
forefathers
and
common
to
all
labourers
on
the
land
that
just
as
in
the
world
of
plants
and
animals
nothing
ceases
to
exist
but
continually
changes
its
form
the
manure
into
grain
the
grain
into
a
food
the
tadpole
into
a
frog
the
caterpillar
into
a
butterfly
the
acorn
into
an
oak
so
man
also
does
not
perish
but
only
undergoes
a
change
he
believed
in
this
and
therefore
always
looked
death
straight
in
the
face
and
bravely
bore
the
sufferings
that
lead
towards
it
but
did
not
care
and
did
not
know
how
to
speak
about
it
he
loved
work
was
always
employed
in
some
practical
business
and
put
his
comrades
in
the
way
of
the
same
kind
of
practical
work
the
other
political
prisoner
from
among
the
people
markel
kondratieff
was
a
very
different
kind
of
man
he
began
to
work
at
the
age
of
fifteen
and
took
to
smoking
and
drinking
in
order
to
stifle
a
dense
sense
of
being
wronged
he
first
realised
he
was
wronged
one
christmas
when
they
the
factory
children
were
invited
to
a
christmas
tree
got
up
by
the
employers
wife
where
he
received
a
farthing
whistle
an
apple
a
gilt
walnut
and
a
fig
while
the
employers
children
had
presents
given
them
which
seemed
gifts
from
fairyland
and
had
cost
more
than
fifty
roubles
as
he
afterwards
heard
when
he
was
twenty
a
celebrated
revolutionist
came
to
their
factory
to
work
as
a
working
girl
and
noticing
his
superior
qualities
began
giving
books
and
pamphlets
to
kondratieff
and
to
talk
and
explain
his
position
to
him
and
how
to
remedy
it
when
the
possibility
of
freeing
himself
and
others
from
their
oppressed
state
rose
clearly
in
his
mind
the
injustice
of
this
state
appeared
more
cruel
and
more
terrible
than
before
and
he
longed
passionately
not
only
for
freedom
but
also
for
the
punishment
of
those
who
had
arranged
and
who
kept
up
this
cruel
injustice
kondratieff
devoted
himself
with
passion
to
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
it
was
not
clear
to
him
how
knowledge
should
bring
about
the
realisation
of
the
social
ideal
but
he
believed
that
the
knowledge
that
had
shown
him
the
injustice
of
the
state
in
which
he
lived
would
also
abolish
that
injustice
itself
besides
knowledge
would
in
his
opinion
raise
him
above
others
therefore
he
left
off
drinking
and
smoking
and
devoted
all
his
leisure
time
to
study
the
revolutionist
gave
him
lessons
and
his
thirst
for
every
kind
of
knowledge
and
the
facility
with
which
he
took
it
in
surprised
her
in
two
years
he
had
mastered
algebra
geometry
historywhich
he
was
specially
fond
ofand
made
acquaintance
with
artistic
and
critical
and
especially
socialistic
literature
the
revolutionist
was
arrested
and
kondratieff
with
her
forbidden
books
having
been
found
in
their
possession
and
they
were
imprisoned
and
then
exiled
to
the
vologda
government
there
kondratieff
became
acquainted
with
novodvoroff
and
read
a
great
deal
more
revolutionary
literature
remembered
it
all
and
became
still
firmer
in
his
socialistic
views
while
in
exile
he
became
leader
in
a
large
strike
which
ended
in
the
destruction
of
a
factory
and
the
murder
of
the
director
he
was
again
arrested
and
condemned
to
siberia
his
religious
views
were
of
the
same
negative
nature
as
his
views
of
the
existing
economic
conditions
having
seen
the
absurdity
of
the
religion
in
which
he
was
brought
up
and
having
gained
with
great
effort
and
at
first
with
fear
but
later
with
rapture
freedom
from
it
he
did
not
tire
of
viciously
and
with
venom
ridiculing
priests
and
religious
dogmas
as
if
wishing
to
revenge
himself
for
the
deception
that
had
been
practised
on
him
he
was
ascetic
through
habit
contented
himself
with
very
little
and
like
all
those
used
to
work
from
childhood
and
whose
muscles
have
been
developed
he
could
work
much
and
easily
and
was
quick
at
any
manual
labour
but
what
he
valued
most
was
the
leisure
in
prisons
and
halting
stations
which
enabled
him
to
continue
his
studies
he
was
now
studying
the
first
volume
of
karl
markss
and
carefully
hid
the
book
in
his
sack
as
if
it
were
a
great
treasure
he
behaved
with
reserve
and
indifference
to
all
his
comrades
except
novodvoroff
to
whom
he
was
greatly
attached
and
whose
arguments
on
all
subjects
he
accepted
as
unanswerable
truths
he
had
an
indefinite
contempt
for
women
whom
he
looked
upon
as
a
hindrance
in
all
necessary
business
but
he
pitied
maslova
and
was
gentle
with
her
for
he
considered
her
an
example
of
the
way
the
lower
are
exploited
by
the
upper
classes
the
same
reason
made
him
dislike
nekhludoff
so
that
he
talked
little
with
him
and
never
pressed
nekhludoffs
hand
but
only
held
out
his
own
to
be
pressed
when
greeting

the

the

took
the
place

on

kryltzoff
who
had
taken
off
his
wet
cloak
and
wrapped
himself
in
his
dry
plaid
and
lay
in
his
own
place
talking
to
nekhludoff
after
the
cold
and
damp
march
and
the
dirt
and
disorder
they
had
found
here
and
after
the
pains
they
had
taken
to
get
it
tidy
after
having
drunk
hot
tea
and
eaten
they
were
all
in
the
best
and
brightest
of
spirits
the
fact
that
the
tramp
of
feet
the
screams
and
abuse
of
the
criminals
reached
them
through
the
wall
reminding
them
of
their
surroundings
seemed
only
to
increase
the
sense
of
coziness
as
on
an
island
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
these
people
felt
themselves
for
a
brief
interval
not
swamped
by
the
degradation
and
sufferings
which
surrounded
them
this
made
their
spirits
rise
and
excited
them
they
talked
about
everything
except
their
present
position
and
that
which
awaited
them
then
as
it
generally
happens
among
young
men
and
women
especially
if
they
are
forced
to
remain
together
as
these
people
were
all
sorts
of
agreements
and
disagreements
and
attractions
curiously
blended
had
sprung
up
among
them
almost
all
of
them
were
in
love
novodvoroff
was
in
love
with
the
pretty
smiling
grabetz
this
grabetz
was
a
young
thoughtless
girl
who
had
gone
in
for
a
course
of
study
perfectly
indifferent
to
revolutionary
questions
but
succumbing
to
the
influence
of
the
day
she
compromised
herself
in
some
way
and
was
exiled
the
chief
interest
of
her
life
during
the
time
of
her
trial
in
prison
and
in
exile
was
her
success
with
men
just
as
it
had
been
when
she
was
free
now
on
the
way
she
comforted
herself
with
the
fact
that
novodvoroff
had
taken
a
fancy
to
her
and
she
fell
in
love
with
him
vera
doukhova
who
was
very
prone
to
fall
in
love
herself
but
did
not
awaken
love
in
others
though
she
was
always
hoping
for
mutual
love
was
sometimes
drawn
to
nabatoff
then
to
novodvoroff
kryltzoff
felt
something
like
love
for
mary
pavlovna
he
loved
her
with
a
mans
love
but
knowing
how
she
regarded
this
sort
of
love
hid
his
feelings
under
the
guise
of
friendship
and
gratitude
for
the
tenderness
with
which
she
attended
to
his
wants
nabatoff
and
rintzeva
were
attached
to
each
other
by
very
complicated
ties
just
as
mary
pavlovna
was
a
perfectly
chaste
maiden
in
the
same
way
rintzeva
was
perfectly
chaste
as
her
own
husbands
wife
when
only
a
schoolgirl
of
sixteen
she
fell
in
love
with
rintzeff
a
student
of
the
petersburg
university
and
married
him
before
he
left
the
university
when
she
was
only
nineteen
years
old
during
his
fourth
year
at
the
university
her
husband
had
become
involved
in
the
students
rows
was
exiled
from
petersburg
and
turned
revolutionist
she
left
the
medical
courses
she
was
attending
followed
him
and
also
turned
revolutionist
if
she
had
not
considered
her
husband
the
cleverest
and
best
of
men
she
would
not
have
fallen
in
love
with
him
and
if
she
had
not
fallen
in
love
would
not
have
married
but
having
fallen
in
love
and
married
him
whom
she
thought
the
best
and
cleverest
of
men
she
naturally
looked
upon
life
and
its
aims
in
the
way
the
best
and
cleverest
of
men
looked
at
them
at
first
he
thought
the
aim
of
life
was
to
learn
and
she
looked
upon
study
as
the
aim
of
life
he
became
a
revolutionist
and
so
did
she
she
could
demonstrate
very
clearly
that
the
existing
state
of
things
could
not
go
on
and
that
it
was
everybodys
duty
to
fight
this
state
of
things
and
to
try
to
bring
about
conditions
in
which
the
individual
could
develop
freely
etc
and
she
imagined
that
she
really
thought
and
felt
all
this
but
in
reality
she
only
regarded
everything
her
husband
thought
as
absolute
truth
and
only
sought
for
perfect
agreement
perfect
identification
of
her
own
soul
with
his
which
alone
could
give
her
full
moral
satisfaction
the
parting
with
her
husband
and
their
child
whom
her
mother
had
taken
was
very
hard
to
bear
but
she
bore
it
firmly
and
quietly
since
it
was
for
her
husbands
sake
and
for
that
cause
which
she
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
was
true
since
he
served
it
she
was
always
with
her
husband
in
thoughts
and
did
not
love
and
could
not
love
any
other
any
more
than
she
had
done
before
but
nabatoffs
devoted
and
pure
love
touched
and
excited
her
this
moral
firm
man
her
husbands
friend
tried
to
treat
her
as
a
sister
but
something
more
appeared
in
his
behaviour
to
her
and
this
something
frightened
them
both
and
yet
gave
colour
to
their
life
of
hardship
so
that
in
all
this
circle
only
mary
pavlovna
and
kondratieff
were
quite
free
from
love
affairs
chapter
xiv
conversations
in
prison
expecting
to
have
a
private
talk
with
katusha
as
usual
after
tea
nekhludoff
sat
by
the
side
of
kryltzoff
conversing
with
him
among
other
things
he
told
him
the
story
of
makars
crime
and
about
his
request
to
him
kryltzoff
listened
attentively
gazing
at
nekhludoff
with
glistening
eyes
yes
said
kryltzoff
suddenly
i
often
think
that
here
we
are
going
side
by
side
with
them
and
who
are
they
the
same
for
whose
sake
we
are
going
and
yet
we
not
only
do
not
know
them
but
do
not
even
wish
to
know
them
and
they
even
worse
than
that
they
hate
us
and
look
upon
us
as
enemies
this
is
terrible
there
is
nothing
terrible
about
it
broke
in
novodvoroff
the
masses
always
worship
power
only
the
government
is
in
power
and
they
worship
it
and
hate
us
tomorrow
we
shall
have
the
power
and
they
will
worship
us
he
said
with
his
grating
voice
at
that
moment
a
volley
of
abuse
and
the
rattle
of
chains
sounded
from
behind
the
wall
something
was
heard
thumping
against
it
and
screaming
and
shrieking
some
one
was
being
beaten
and
some
one
was
calling
out
murder
help
hear
them
the
beasts
what
intercourse
can
there
be
between
us
and
such
as
them
quietly
remarked
novodvoroff
you
call
them
beasts
and
nekhludoff
was
just
telling
me
about
such
an
action
irritably
retorted
kryltzoff
and
went
on
to
say
how
makar
was
risking
his
life
to
save
a
fellowvillager
that
is
not
the
action
of
a
beast
it
is
heroism
sentimentality
novodvoroff
ejaculated
ironically
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
understand
the
emotions
of
these
people
and
the
motives
on
which
they
act
you
see
generosity
in
the
act
and
it
may
be
simply
jealousy
of
that
other
criminal
how
is
it
that
you
never
wish
to
see
anything
good
in
another
mary
pavlovna
said
suddenly
flaring
up
how
can
one
see
what
does
not
exist
how
does
it
not
exist
when
a
man
risks
dying
a
terrible
death
i
think
said
novodvoroff
that
if
we
mean
to
do
our
work
the
first
condition
is
that
here
kondratieff
put
down
the
book
he
was
reading
by
the
lamplight
and
began
to
listen
attentively
to
his
masters
words
we
should
not
give
way
to
fancy
but
look
at
things
as
they
are
we
should
do
all
in
our
power
for
the
masses
and
expect
nothing
in
return
the
masses
can
only
be
the
object
of
our
activity
but
cannot
be
our
fellowworkers
as
long
as
they
remain
in
that
state
of
inertia
they
are
in
at
present
he
went
on
as
if
delivering
a
lecture
therefore
to
expect
help
from
them
before
the
process
of
developmentthat
process
which
we
are
preparing
them
forhas
taken
place
is
an
illusion
what
process
of
development
kryltzoff
began
flushing
all
over
we
say
that
we
are
against
arbitrary
rule
and
despotism
and
is
this
not
the
most
awful
despotism
no
despotism
whatever
quietly
rejoined
novodvoroff
i
am
only
saying
that
i
know
the
path
that
the
people
must
travel
and
can
show
them
that
path
but
how
can
you
be
sure
that
the
path
you
show
is
the
true
path
is
this
not
the
same
kind
of
despotism
that
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
inquisition
all
persecutions
and
the
great
revolution
they
too
knew
the
one
true
way
by
means
of
their
science
their
having
erred
is
no
proof
of
my
going
to
err
besides
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
ravings
of
idealogues
and
the
facts
based
on
sound
economic
science
novodvoroffs
voice
filled
the
room
he
alone
was
speaking
all
the
rest
were
silent
they
are
always
disputing
mary
pavlovna
said
when
there
was
a
moments
silence
and
you
yourself
what
do
you
think
about
it
nekhludoff
asked
her
i
think
kryltzoff
is
right
when
he
says
we
should
not
force
our
views
on
the
people
and
you
katusha
asked
nekhludoff
with
a
smile
waiting
anxiously
for
her
answer
fearing
she
would
say
something
awkward
i
think
the
common
people
are
wronged
she
said
and
blushed
scarlet
i
think
they
are
dreadfully
wronged
thats
right
maslova
quite
right
cried
nabatoff
they
are
terribly
wronged
the
people
and
they
must
not
be
wronged
and
therein
lies
the
whole
of
our
task
a
curious
idea
of
the
object
of
revolution
novodvoroff
remarked
crossly
and
began
to
smoke
i
cannot
talk
to
him
said
kryltzoff
in
a
whisper
and
was
silent
and
it
is
much
better
not
to
talk
nekhludoff
said
chapter
xv
novodvoroff
although
novodvoroff
was
highly
esteemed
of
all
the
revolutionists
though
he
was
very
learned
and
considered
very
wise
nekhludoff
reckoned
him
among
those
of
the
revolutionists
who
being
below
the
average
moral
level
were
very
far
below
it
his
inner
life
was
of
a
nature
directly
opposite
to
that
of
simonsons
simonson
was
one
of
those
people
of
an
essentially
masculine
type
whose
actions
follow
the
dictates
of
their
reason
and
are
determined
by
it
novodvoroff
belonged
on
the
contrary
to
the
class
of
people
of
a
feminine
type
whose
reason
is
directed
partly
towards
the
attainment
of
aims
set
by
their
feelings
partly
to
the
justification
of
acts
suggested
by
their
feelings
the
whole
of
novodvoroffs
revolutionary
activity
though
he
could
explain
it
very
eloquently
and
very
convincingly
appeared
to
nekhludoff
to
be
founded
on
nothing
but
ambition
and
the
desire
for
supremacy
at
first
his
capacity
for
assimilating
the
thoughts
of
others
and
of
expressing
them
correctly
had
given
him
a
position
of
supremacy
among
pupils
and
teachers
in
the
gymnasium
and
the
university
where
qualities
such
as
his
are
highly
prized
and
he
was
satisfied
when
he
had
finished
his
studies
and
received
his
diploma
he
suddenly
altered
his
views
and
from
a
modern
liberal
he
turned
into
a
rabid
narodovoletz
in
order
so
kryltzoff
who
did
not
like
him
said
to
gain
supremacy
in
another
sphere
as
he
was
devoid
of
those
moral
and
aesthetic
qualities
which
call
forth
doubts
and
hesitation
he
very
soon
acquired
a
position
in
the
revolutionary
world
which
satisfied
himthat
of
the
leader
of
a
party
having
once
chosen
a
direction
he
never
doubted
or
hesitated
and
was
therefore
certain
that
he
never
made
a
mistake
everything
seemed
quite
simple
clear
and
certain
and
the
narrowness
and
onesidedness
of
his
views
did
make
everything
seem
simple
and
clear
one
only
had
to
be
logical
as
he
said
his
selfassurance
was
so
great
that
it
either
repelled
people
or
made
them
submit
to
him
as
he
carried
on
his
work
among
very
young
people
his
boundless
selfassurance
led
them
to
believe
him
very
profound
and
wise
the
majority
did
submit
to
him
and
he
had
a
great
success
in
revolutionary
circles
his
activity
was
directed
to
the
preparation
of
a
rising
in
which
he
was
to
usurp
the
power
and
call
together
a
council
a
programme
composed
by
him
should
be
proposed
before
the
council
and
he
felt
sure
that
this
programme
of
his
solved
every
problem
and
that
it
would
be
impossible
not
to
carry
it
out
his
comrades
respected
but
did
not
love
him
he
did
not
love
any
one
looked
upon
all
men
of
note
as
upon
rivals
and
would
have
willingly
treated
them
as
old
male
monkeys
treat
young
ones
if
he
could
have
done
it
he
would
have
torn
all
mental
power
every
capacity
from
other
men
so
that
they
should
not
interfere
with
the
display
of
his
talents
he
behaved
well
only
to
those
who
bowed
before
him
now
on
the
journey
he
behaved
well
to
kondratieff
who
was
influenced
by
his
propaganda
to
vera
doukhova
and
pretty
little
grabetz
who
were
both
in
love
with
him
although
in
principle
he
was
in
favour
of
the
womans
movement
yet
in
the
depth
of
his
soul
he
considered
all
women
stupid
and
insignificant
except
those
whom
he
was
sentimentally
in
love
with
as
he
was
now
in
love
with
grabetz
and
such
women
he
considered
to
be
exceptions
whose
merits
he
alone
was
capable
of
discerning
the
question
of
the
relations
of
the
sexes
he
also
looked
upon
as
thoroughly
solved
by
accepting
free
union
he
had
one
nominal
and
one
real
wife
from
both
of
whom
he
was
separated
having
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
real
love
between
them
and
now
he
thought
of
entering
on
a
free
union
with
grabetz
he
despised
nekhludoff
for
playing
the
fool
as
novodvoroff
termed
it
with
maslova
but
especially
for
the
freedom
nekhludoff
took
of
considering
the
defects
of
the
existing
system
and
the
methods
of
correcting
those
defects
in
a
manner
which
was
not
only
not
exactly
the
same
as
novodvoroffs
but
was
nekhludoffs
owna
princes
that
is
a
fools
manner
nekhludoff
felt
this
relation
of
novodvoroffs
towards
him
and
knew
to
his
sorrow
that
in
spite
of
the
state
of
good
will
in
which
he
found
himself
on
this
journey
he
could
not
help
paying
this
man
in
his
own
coin
and
could
not
stifle
the
strong
antipathy
he
felt
for
him

the
voices
of
officials
sounded
from
the
next
room
all
the
prisoners
were
silent
and
a
sergeant
followed
by
two
convoy
soldiers
entered
the
time

come
the

counted

and

came
he
addressed

familiarity

by
a
convict
a
spare
man
with
a
thin
beard
and
a
bruise
under
his
eye
came
in
its
about
the
girl
i

come
said
the
convict
heres
daddy
come
came
the
ringing
accents
of
a
childs
voice
and
a
flaxen
head
appeared
from
behind
rintzeva
who
with
katushas
and
mary
pavlovnas
help
was
making
a
new
garment
for
the
child
out
of

of
rintzevas

petticoats

the
prisoner
said
softly

mary
pavlovna
looking
with
pity
at
bousovkins
bruised
face

us

ladies

the
girl
pointing
to
rintzevas
sewingnice
red
ones
she
went
on
prattling
do
you
wish
to

asked
rintzeva
caressing
the
child
yes
i
wish

daddy
too
no
daddy

well
leave
her
then
she
said
turning
to
the
father
yes
you
may
leave
her
said
the
first
sergeant
and
went
out
with
the
other
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
room
nabatoff
went
up
to
bousovkin
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
said
i
say
old
fellow
is
it
true
that
karmanoff
wishes
to
exchange
bousovkins
kindly
gentle
face
turned
suddenly
sad
and
a
veil
seemed
to
dim
his
eyes
we
have
heard
nothinghardly
he
said
and
with
the
same
dimness
still
over
his
eyes
he
turned
to
the
child
well
aksutka
it
seems
youre
to
make
yourself
comfortable
with
the
ladies
and
he
hurried
away
its
true
about
the
exchange
and
he
knows
it
very
well
said
nabatoff
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
shall
tell
the
authorities
in
the
next
town
i
know
both
prisoners
by
sight
said
nekhludoff
all
were
silent
fearing
a
recommencement
of
the
dispute
simonson
who
had
been
lying
with
his
arms
thrown
back
behind
his
head
and
not
speaking
rose
and
determinately
walked
up
to
nekhludoff
carefully
passing
round
those
who
were
sitting
could
you
listen
to
me
now
of
course
and
nekhludoff
rose
and
followed
him
katusha
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
suspense
and
meeting
nekhludoffs
eyes
she
blushed
and
shook
her
head
what
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
is
this
simonson
began
when
they
had
come
out
into
the
passage
in
the
passage
the
din
of
the
criminals
voices
and
shouts
sounded
louder
nekhludoff
made
a
face
but
simonson
did
not
seem
to
take
any
notice
knowing
of
your
relations
to
katerina
maslova
he
began
seriously
and
frankly
with
his
kind
eyes
looking
straight
into
nekhludoffs
face
i
consider
it
my
dutyhe
was
obliged
to
stop
because
two
voices
were
heard
disputing
and
shouting
both
at
once
close
to
the
door
i
tell
you
blockhead
they
are
not
mine
one
voice
shouted
may
you
choke
you
devil
snorted
the
other
at
this
moment
mary
pavlovna
came
out
into
the
passage
how
can
one
talk
here
she
said
go
in
vera
is
alone
there
and
she
went
in
at
the
second
door
and
entered
a
tiny
room
evidently
meant
for
a
solitary
cell
which
was
now
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
political
women
prisoners
vera
doukhova
lay
covered
up
head
and
all
on
the
bed
she
has
got
a
headache
and
is
asleep
so
she
cannot
hear
you
and
i
will
go
away
said
mary
pavlovna
on
the
contrary
stay
here
said
simonson
i
have
no
secrets
from
any
one
certainly
none
from
you
all
right
said
mary
pavlovna
and
moving
her
whole
body
from
side
to
side
like
a
child
so
as
to
get
farther
back
on
to
the
bed
she
settled
down
to
listen
her
beautiful
hazel
eyes
seeming
to
look
somewhere
far
away
well
then
this
is
my
business
simonson
repeated
knowing
of
your
relations
to
katerina
maslova
i
consider
myself
bound
to
explain
to
you
my
relations
to
her
nekhludoff
could
not
help
admiring
the
simplicity
and
truthfulness
with
which
simonson
spoke
to
him
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
should
like
to
marry
katerina
maslova
how
strange
said
mary
pavlovna
fixing
her
eyes
on
simonson
and
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
simonson
continued
what
can
i
do
it
depends
on
her
said
nekhludoff
yes
but
she
will
not
come
to
any
decision
without
you
why
because
as
long
as
your
relations
with
her
are
unsettled
she
cannot
make
up
her
mind
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
is
finally
settled
i
should
like
to
do
what
i
consider
to
be
my
duty
and
also
to
lighten
her
fate
but
on
no
account
would
i
wish
to
put
any
restraint
on
her
yes
but
she
does
not
wish
to
accept
your
sacrifice
it
is
no
sacrifice
and
i
know
that
this
decision
of
hers
is
final
well
then
there
is
no
need
to
speak
to
me
said
nekhludoff
she
wants
you
to
acknowledge
that
you
think
as
she
does
how
can
i
acknowledge
that
i
must
not
do
what
i
consider
to
be
my
duty
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
not
free
but
she
is
simonson
was
silent
then
after
thinking
a
little
he
said
very
well
then
ill
tell
her
you
must
not
think
i
am
in
love
with
her
he
continued
i
love
her
as
a
splendid
unique
human
being
who
has
suffered
much
i
want
nothing
from
her
i
have
only
an
awful
longing
to
help
her
to
lighten
her
posi
nekhludoff
was
surprised
to
hear
the
trembling
in
simonsons
voice
to
lighten
her
position
simonson
continued
if
she
does
not
wish
to
accept
your
help
let
her
accept
mine
if
she
consents
i
shall
ask
to
be
sent
to
the
place
where
she
will
be
imprisoned
four
years
are
not
an
eternity
i
would
live
near
her
and
perhaps
might
lighten
her
fate
and
he
again
stopped
too
agitated
to
continue
what
am
i
to
say
said
nekhludoff
i
am
very
glad
she
has
found
such
a
protector
as
you
thats
what
i
wanted
to
know
simonson
interrupted
i
wanted
to
know
if
loving
her
and
wishing
her
happiness
you
would
consider
it
good
for
her
to
marry
me
oh
yes
said
nekhludoff
decidedly
it
all
depends
on
her
i
only
wish
that
this
suffering
soul
should
find
rest
said
simonson
with
such
childlike
tenderness
as
no
one
could
have
expected
from
so
moroselooking
a
man
simonson
rose
and
stretching
his
lips
out
to
nekhludoff
smiled
shyly
and
kissed
him
so
i
shall
tell
her
and
he
went
away
chapter
xvii
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
mary
pavlovna
in
lovequite
in
love
now
thats
a
thing
i
never
should
have
expected
that
valdemar
simonson
should
be
in
love
and
in
the
silliest
most
boyish
manner
it
is
strange
and
to
say
the
truth
it
is
sad
and
she
sighed
but
she
katusha
how
does
she
look
at
it
do
you
think
nekhludoff
asked
she
mary
pavlovna
waited
evidently
wishing
to
give
as
exact
an
answer
as
possible
she
well
you
see
in
spite
of
her
past
she
has
one
of
the
most
moral
naturesand
such
fine
feelings
she
loves
youloves
you
well
and
is
happy
to
be
able
to
do
you
even
the
negative
good
of
not
letting
you
get
entangled
with
her
marriage
with
you
would
be
a
terrible
fall
for
her
worse
than
all
thats
past
and
therefore
she
will
never
consent
to
it
and
yet
your
presence
troubles
her
well
what
am
i
to
do
ought
i
to
vanish
mary
pavlovna
smiled
her
sweet
childlike
smile
and
said
yes
partly
how
is
one
to
vanish
partly
i
am
talking
nonsense
but
as
for
her
i
should
like
to
tell
you
that
she
probably
sees
the
silliness
of
this
rapturous
kind
of
love
he
has
not
spoken
to
her
and
is
both
flattered
and
afraid
of
it
i
am
not
competent
to
judge
in
such
affairs
you
know
still
i
believe
that
on
his
part
it
is
the
most
ordinary
mans
feeling
though
it
is
masked
he
says
that
this
love
arouses
his
energy
and
is
platonic
but
i
know
that
even
if
it
is
exceptional
still
at
the
bottom
it
is
degrading
mary
pavlovna
had
wandered
from
the
subject
having
started
on
her
favourite
theme
well
but
what
am
i
to
do
nekhludoff
asked
i
think
you
should
tell
her
everything
it
is
always
best
that
everything
should
be
clear
have
a
talk
with
her
i
shall
call
her
shall
i
said
mary
pavlovna
if
you
please
said
nekhludoff
and
mary
pavlovna
went
a
strange
feeling
overcame
nekhludoff
when
he
was
alone
in
the
little
room
with
the
sleeping
vera
doukhova
listening
to
her
soft
breathing
broken
now
and
then
by
moans
and
to
the
incessant
dirt
that
came
through
the
two
doors
that
separated
him
from
the
criminals
what
simonson
had
told
him
freed
him
from
the
selfimposed
duty
which
had
seemed
hard
and
strange
to
him
in
his
weak
moments
and
yet
now
he
felt
something
that
was
not
merely
unpleasant
but
painful
he
had
a
feeling
that
this
offer
of
simonsons
destroyed
the
exceptional
character
of
his
sacrifice
and
thereby
lessened
its
value
in
his
own
and
others
eyes
if
so
good
a
man
who
was
not
bound
to
her
by
any
kind
of
tie
wanted
to
join
his
fate
to
hers
then
this
sacrifice
was
not
so
great
there
may
have
also
been
an
admixture
of
ordinary
jealousy
he
had
got
so
used
to
her
love
that
he
did
not
like
to
admit
that
she
loved
another
then
it
also
upset
the
plans
he
had
formed
of
living
near
her
while
she
was
doing
her
term
if
she
married
simonson
his
presence
would
be
unnecessary
and
he
would
have
to
form
new
plans
before
he
had
time
to
analyse
his
feelings
the
loud
din
of
the
prisoners
voices
came
in
with
a
rush
something
special
was
going
on
among
them
today
as
the
door
opened
to
let
katusha
in
she
stepped
briskly
close
up
to
him
and
said
mary
pavlovna
has
sent
me
yes
i
must
have
a
talk
with
you
sit
down
valdemar
simonson
has
been
speaking
to
me
she
sat
down
and
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
seemed
quite
calm
but
hardly
had
nekhludoff
uttered
simonsons
name
when
she
flushed
crimson
what
did
he
say
she
asked
he
told
me
he
wanted
to
marry
you
her
face
suddenly
puckered
up
with
pain
but
she
said
nothing
and
only
cast
down
her
eyes
he
is
asking
for
my
consent
or
my
advice
i
told
him
that
it
all
depends
entirely
on
youthat
you
must
decide
ah
what
does
it
all
mean
why
she
muttered
and
looked
in
his
eyes
with
that
peculiar
squint
that
always
strangely
affected
nekhludoff
they
sat
silent
for
a
few
minutes
looking
into
each
others
eyes
and
this
look
told
much
to
both
of
them
you
must
decide
nekhludoff
repeated
what
am
i
to
decide
everything
has
long
been
decided
no
you
must
decide
whether
you
will
accept
mr
simonsons
offer
said
nekhludoff
what
sort
of
a
wife
can
i
bei
a
convict
why
should
i
ruin
mr
simonson
too
she
said
with
a
frown
well
but
if
the
sentence
should
be
mitigated
oh
leave
me
alone
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
she
said
and
rose
to
leave
the
room
chapter
xviii
neveroffs
fate
when
following
katusha
nekhludoff
returned
to
the
mens
room
he
found
every
one
there
in
agitation
nabatoff
who
went
about
all
over
the
place
and
who
got
to
know
everybody
and
noticed
everything
had
just
brought
news
which
staggered
them
all
the
news
was
that
he
had
discovered
a
note
on
a
wall
written
by
the
revolutionist
petlin
who
had
been
sentenced
to
hard
labour
and
who
every
one
thought
had
long
since
reached
the
kara
and
now
it
turned
out
that
he
had
passed
this
way
quite
recently
the
only
political
prisoner
among
criminal
convicts
on
the
17th
of
august
so
ran
the
note
i
was
sent
off
alone
with
the
criminals
neveroff
was
with
me
but
hanged
himself
in
the
lunatic
asylum
in
kasan
i
am
well
and
in
good
spirits
and
hope
for
the
best
all
were
discussing
petlins
position
and
the
possible
reasons
of
neveroffs
suicide
only
kryltzoff
sat
silent
and
preoccupied
his
glistening
eyes
gazing
fixedly
in
front
of
him
my
husband
told
me
that
neveroff
had
a
vision
while
still
in
the
petropavlovski
prison
said
rintzeva
yes
he
was
a
poet
a
dreamer
this
sort
of
people
cannot
stand
solitary
confinement
said
novodvoroff
now
i
never
gave
my
imagination
vent
when
in
solitary
confinement
but
arranged
my
days
most
systematically
and
in
this
way
always
bore
it
very
well
what
is
there
unbearable
about
it
why
i
used
to
be
glad
when
they
locked
me
up
said
nabatoff
cheerfully
wishing
to
dispel
the
general
depression
a
fellows
afraid
of
everything
of
being
arrested
himself
and
entangling
others
and
of
spoiling
the
whole
business
and
then
he
gets
locked
up
and
all
responsibility
is
at
an
end
and
he
can
rest
he
can
just
sit
and
smoke
you
knew
him
well
asked
mary
pavlovna
glancing
anxiously
at
the
altered
haggard
expression
of
kryltzoffs
face
neveroff
a
dreamer
kryltzoff
suddenly
began
panting
for
breath
as
if
he
had
been
shouting
or
singing
for
a
long
time
neveroff
was
a
man
such
as
the
earth
bears
few
of
as
our
doorkeeper
used
to
express
it
yes
he
had
a
nature
like
crystal
you
could
see
him
right
through
he
could
not
lie
he
could
not
dissemble
not
simply
thin
skinned
but
with
all
his
nerves
laid
bare
as
if
he
were
flayed
yes
his
was
a
complicated
rich
nature
not
such
a
but
where
is
the
use
of
talking
he
added
with
a
vicious
frown
shall
we
first
educate
the
people
and
then
change
the
forms
of
life
or
first
change
the
forms
and
then
struggle
using
peaceful
propaganda
or
terrorism
so
we
go
on
disputing
while
they
kill
they
do
not
disputethey
know
their
business
they
dont
care
whether
dozens
hundreds
of
men
perishand
what
men
no
that
the
best
should
perish
is
just
what
they
want
yes
herzen
said
that
when
the
decembrists
were
withdrawn
from
circulation
the
average
level
of
our
society
sank
i
should
think
so
indeed
then
herzen
himself
and
his
fellows
were
withdrawn
now
is
the
turn
of
the
neveroffs
they
cant
all
be
got
rid
off
said
nabatoff
in
his
cheerful
tones
there
will
always
be
left
enough
to
continue
the
breed
no
there
wont
if
we
show
any
pity
to
them
there
nabatoff
said
raising
his
voice
and
not
letting
himself
be
interrupted
give
me
a
cigarette
oh
anatole
it
is
not
good
for
you
said
mary
pavlovna
please
do
not
smoke
oh
leave
me
alone
he
said
angrily
and
lit
a
cigarette
but
at
once
began
to
cough
and
to
retch
as
if
he
were
going
to
be
sick
having
cleared
his
throat
though
he
went
on
what
we
have
been
doing
is
not
the
thing
at
all
not
to
argue
but
for
all
to
uniteto
destroy
themthats
it
but
they
are
also
human
beings
said
nekhludoff
no
they
are
not
human
they
who
can
do
what
they
are
doingnothere
now
i
heard
that
some
kind
of
bombs
and
balloons
have
been
invented
well
one
ought
to
go
up
in
such
a
balloon
and
sprinkle
bombs
down
on
them
as
if
they
were
bugs
until
they
are
all
exterminatedyes
because
he
was
going
to
continue
but
flushing
all
over
he
began
coughing
worse
than
before
and
a
stream
of
blood
rushed
from
his
mouth
nabatoff
ran
to
get
ice
mary
pavlovna
brought
valerian
drops
and
offered
them
to
him
but
he
breathing
quickly
and
heavily
pushed
her
away
with
his
thin
white
hand
and
kept
his
eyes
closed
when
the
ice
and
cold
water
had
eased
kryltzoff
a
little
and
he
had
been
put
to
bed
nekhludoff
having
said
goodnight
to
everybody
went
out
with
the
sergeant
who
had
been
waiting
for
him
some
time
the
criminals
were
now
quiet
and
most
of
them
were
asleep
though
the
people
were
lying
on
and
under
the
bed
shelves
and
in
the
space
between
they
could
not
all
be
placed
inside
the
rooms
and
some
of
them
lay
in
the
passage
with
their
sacks
under
their
heads
and
covered
with
their
cloaks
the
moans
and
sleepy
voices
came
through
the
open
doors
and
sounded
through
the
passage
everywhere
lay
compact
heaps
of
human
beings
covered
with
prison
cloaks
only
a
few
men
who
were
sitting
in
the
bachelors
room
by
the
light
of
a
candle
end
which
they
put
out
when
they
noticed
the
sergeant
were
awake
and
an
old
man
who
sat
naked
under
the
lamp
in
the
passage
picking
the
vermin
off
his
shirt
the
foul
air
in
the
political
prisoners
rooms
seemed
pure
compared
to
the
stinking
closeness
here
the
smoking
lamp
shone
dimly
as
through
a
mist
and
it
was
difficult
to
breathe
stepping
along
the
passage
one
had
to
look
carefully
for
an
empty
space
and
having
put
down
one
foot
had
to
find
place
for
the
other
three
persons
who
had
evidently
found
no
room
even
in
the
passage
lay
in
the
anteroom
close
to
the
stinking
and
leaking
tub
one
of
these
was
an
old
idiot
whom
nekhludoff
had
often
seen
marching
with
the
gang
another
was
a
boy
about
twelve
he
lay
between
the
two
other
convicts
with
his
head
on
the
leg
of
one
of
them
when
he
had
passed
out
of
the
gate
nekhludoff
took
a
deep
breath
and
long
continued
to
breathe
in
deep
draughts
of
frosty
air

why
is
it
done
it
had
cleared
up
and
was
starlight
except
in
a
few
places
the
mud
was
frozen
hard
when
nekhludoff
returned
to
his
inn
and
knocked
at
one
of
its
dark
windows
the
broadshouldered
labourer
came
barefooted
to
open
the
door
for
him
and
let
him
in
through
a
door
on
the
right
leading
to
the
back
premises
came
the
loud
snoring
of
the
carters
who
slept
there
and
the
sound
of
many
horses
chewing
oats
came
from
the
yard
the
front
room
where
a
red
lamp
was
burning
in
front
of
the
icons
smelt
of
wormwood
and
perspiration
and
some
one
with
mighty
lungs
was
snoring
behind
a
partition
nekhludoff
undressed
put
his
leather
travelling
pillow
on
the
oilcloth
sofa
spread
out
his
rug
and
lay
down
thinking
over
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
that
day
the
boy
sleeping
on
the
liquid
that
oozed
from
the
stinking
tub
with
his
head
on
the
convicts
leg
seemed
more
dreadful
than
all
else
unexpected
and
important
as
his
conversation
with
simonson
and
katusha
that
evening
had
been
he
did
not
dwell
on
it
his
situation
in
relation
to
that
subject
was
so
complicated
and
indefinite
that
he
drove
the
thought
from
his
mind
but
the
picture
of
those
unfortunate
beings
inhaling
the
noisome
air
and
lying
in
the
liquid
oozing
out
of
the
stinking
tub
especially
that
of
the
boy
with
his
innocent
face
asleep
on
the
leg
of
a
criminal
came
all
the
more
vividly
to
his
mind
and
he
could
not
get
it
out
of
his
head
to
know
that
somewhere
far
away
there
are
men
who
torture
other
men
by
inflicting
all
sorts
of
humiliations
and
inhuman
degradation
and
sufferings
on
them
or
for
three
months
incessantly
to
look
on
while
men
were
inflicting
these
humiliations
and
sufferings
on
other
men
is
a
very
different
thing
and
nekhludoff
felt
it
more
than
once
during
these
three
months
he
asked
himself
am
i
mad
because
i
see
what
others
do
not
or
are
they
mad
that
do
these
things
that
i
see
yet
they
and
there
were
many
of
them
did
what
seemed
so
astonishing
and
terrible
to
him
with
such
quiet
assurance
that
what
they
were
doing
was
necessary
and
was
important
and
useful
work
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
they
were
mad
nor
could
he
conscious
of
the
clearness
of
his
thoughts
believe
he
was
mad
and
all
this
kept
him
continually
in
a
state
of
perplexity
this
is
how
the
things
he
saw
during
these
three
months
impressed
nekhludoff
from
among
the
people
who
were
free
those
were
chosen
by
means
of
trials
and
the
administration
who
were
the
most
nervous
the
most
hot
tempered
the
most
excitable
the
most
gifted
and
the
strongest
but
the
least
careful
and
cunning
these
people
not
a
wit
more
dangerous
than
many
of
those
who
remained
free
were
first
locked
in
prisons
transported
to
siberia
where
they
were
provided
for
and
kept
months
and
years
in
perfect
idleness
and
away
from
nature
their
families
and
useful
workthat
is
away
from
the
conditions
necessary
for
a
natural
and
moral
life
this
firstly
secondly
these
people
were
subjected
to
all
sorts
of
unnecessary
indignity
in
these
different
placeschains
shaved
heads
shameful
clothingthat
is
they
were
deprived
of
the
chief
motives
that
induce
the
weak
to
live
good
lives
the
regard
for
public
opinion
the
sense
of
shame
and
the
consciousness
of
human
dignity
thirdly
they
were
continually
exposed
to
dangers
such
as
the
epidemics
so
frequent
in
places
of
confinement
exhaustion
flogging
not
to
mention
accidents
such
as
sunstrokes
drowning
or
conflagrations
when
the
instinct
of
selfpreservation
makes
even
the
kindest
most
moral
men
commit
cruel
actions
and
excuse
such
actions
when
committed
by
others
fourthly
these
people
were
forced
to
associate
with
others
who
were
particularly
depraved
by
life
and
especially
by
these
very
institutionsrakes
murderers
and
villainswho
act
on
those
who
are
not
yet
corrupted
by
the
measures
inflicted
on
them
as
leaven
acts
on
dough
and
fifthly
the
fact
that
all
sorts
of
violence
cruelty
inhumanity
are
not
only
tolerated
but
even
permitted
by
the
government
when
it
suits
its
purposes
was
impressed
on
them
most
forcibly
by
the
inhuman
treatment
they
were
subjected
to
by
the
sufferings
inflicted
on
children
women
and
old
men
by
floggings
with
rods
and
whips
by
rewards
offered
for
bringing
a
fugitive
back
dead
or
alive
by
the
separation
of
husbands
and
wives
and
the
uniting
them
with
the
wives
and
husbands
of
others
for
sexual
intercourse
by
shooting
or
hanging
them
to
those
who
were
deprived
of
their
freedom
who
were
in
want
and
misery
acts
of
violence
were
evidently
still
more
permissible
all
these
institutions
seemed
purposely
invented
for
the
production
of
depravity
and
vice
condensed
to
such
a
degree
that
no
other
conditions
could
produce
it
and
for
the
spreading
of
this
condensed
depravity
and
vice
broadcast
among
the
whole
population
just
as
if
a
problem
had
been
set
to
find
the
best
the
surest
means
of
depraving
the
greatest
number
of
persons
thought
nekhludoff
while
investigating
the
deeds
that
were
being
done
in
the
prisons
and
halting
stations
every
year
hundreds
of
thousands
were
brought
to
the
highest
pitch
of
depravity
and
when
completely
depraved
they
were
set
free
to
carry
the
depravity
they
had
caught
in
prison
among
the
people
in
the
prisons
of
tamen
ekaterinburg
tomsk
and
at
the
halting
stations
nekhludoff
saw
how
successfully
the
object
society
seemed
to
have
set
itself
was
attained
ordinary
simple
men
with
a
conception
of
the
demands
of
the
social
and
christian
russian
peasant
morality
lost
this
conception
and
found
a
new
one
founded
chiefly
on
the
idea
that
any
outrage
or
violence
was
justifiable
if
it
seemed
profitable
after
living
in
a
prison
those
people
became
conscious
with
the
whole
of
their
being
that
judging
by
what
was
happening
to
themselves
all
the
moral
laws
the
respect
and
the
sympathy
for
others
which
church
and
the
moral
teachers
preach
was
really
set
aside
and
that
therefore
they
too
need
not
keep
the
laws
nekhludoff
noticed
the
effects
of
prison
life
on
all
the
convicts
he
knewon
fedoroff
on
makar
and
even
on
taras
who
after
two
months
among
the
convicts
struck
nekhludoff
by
the
want
of
morality
in
his
arguments
nekhludoff
found
out
during
his
journey
how
tramps
escaping
into
the
marshes
persuade
a
comrade
to
escape
with
them
and
then
kill
him
and
feed
on
his
flesh
he
saw
a
living
man
who
was
accused
of
this
and
acknowledged
the
fact
and
the
most
terrible
part
was
that
this
was
not
a
solitary
but
a
recurring
case
only
by
a
special
cultivation
of
vice
such
as
was
perpetrated
in
these
establishments
could
a
russian
be
brought
to
the
state
of
this
tramp
who
excelled
nietzsches
newest
teaching
and
held
that
everything
was
possible
and
nothing
forbidden
and
who
spread
this
teaching
first
among
the
convicts
and
then
among
the
people
in
general
the
only
explanation
of
all
that
was
being
done
was
the
wish
to
put
a
stop
to
crime
by
fear
by
correction
by
lawful
vengeance
as
it
was
written
in
the
books
but
in
reality
nothing
in
the
least
resembling
any
of
these
results
came
to
pass
instead
of
vice
being
put
a
stop
to
it
only
spread
further
instead
of
being
frightened
the
criminals
were
encouraged
many
a
tramp
returned
to
prison
of
his
own
free
will
instead
of
being
corrected
every
kind
of
vice
was
systematically
instilled
while
the
desire
for
vengeance
did
not
weaken
by
the
measures
of
the
government
but
was
bred
in
the
people
who
had
none
of
it
then
why
is
it
done
nekhludoff
asked
himself
but
could
find
no
answer
and
what
seemed
most
surprising
was
that
all
this
was
not
being
done
accidentally
not
by
mistake
not
once
but
that
it
had
continued
for
centuries
with
this
difference
only
that
at
first
the
peoples
nostrils
used
to
be
torn
and
their
ears
cut
off
then
they
were
branded
and
now
they
were
manacled
and
transported
by
steam
instead
of
on
the
old
carts
the
arguments
brought
forward
by
those
in
government
service
who
said
that
the
things
which
aroused
his
indignation
were
simply
due
to
the
imperfect
arrangements
of
the
places
of
confinement
and
that
they
could
all
be
put
to
rights
if
prisons
of
a
modern
type
were
built
did
not
satisfy
nekhludoff
because
he
knew
that
what
revolted
him
was
not
the
consequence
of
a
better
or
worse
arrangement
of
the
prisons
he
had
read
of
model
prisons
with
electric
bells
of
executions
by
electricity
recommended
by
tard
but
this
refined
kind
of
violence
revolted
him
even
more
but
what
revolted
nekhludoff
most
was
that
there
were
men
in
the
law
courts
and
in
the
ministry
who
received
large
salaries
taken
from
the
people
for
referring
to
books
written
by
men
like
themselves
and
with
like
motives
and
sorting
actions
that
violated
laws
made
by
themselves
according
to
different
statutes
and
in
obedience
to
these
statutes
sending
those
guilty
of
such
actions
to
places
where
they
were
completely
at
the
mercy
of
cruel
hardened
inspectors
jailers
convoy
soldiers
where
millions
of
them
perished
body
and
soul
now
that
he
had
a
closer
knowledge
of
prisons
nekhludoff
found
out
that
all
those
vices
which
developed
among
the
prisonersdrunkenness
gambling
cruelty
and
all
these
terrible
crimes
even
cannibalismwere
not
casual
or
due
to
degeneration
or
to
the
existence
of
monstrosities
of
the
criminal
type
as
science
going
hand
in
hand
with
the
government
explained
it
but
an
unavoidable
consequence
of
the
incomprehensible
delusion
that
men
may
punish
one
another
nekhludoff
saw
that
cannibalism
did
not
commence
in
the
marshes
but
in
the
ministry
he
saw
that
his
brotherinlaw
for
example
and
in
fact
all
the
lawyers
and
officials
from
the
usher
to
the
minister
do
not
care
in
the
least
for
justice
or
the
good
of
the
people
about
whom
they
spoke
but
only
for
the
roubles
they
were
paid
for
doing
the
things
that
were
the
source
whence
all
this
degradation
and
suffering
flowed
this
was
quite
evident
can
it
be
then
that
all
this
is
done
simply
through
misapprehension
could
it
not
be
managed
that
all
these
officials
should
have
their
salaries
secured
to
them
and
a
premium
paid
them
besides
so
that
they
should
leave
off
doing
all
that
they
were
doing
now
nekhludoff
thought
and
in
spite
of
the
fleas
that
seemed
to
spring
up
round
him
like
water
from
a
fountain
whenever
he
moved
he
fell
fast
asleep

the
journey
resumed
the
carters
had
left
the
inn
long
before
nekhludoff
awoke
the
landlady
had
had
her
tea
and
came
in
wiping
her
fat
perspiring
neck
with
her
handkerchief
and
said
that
a
soldier
had
brought
a
note
from
the
halting
station
the
note
was
from
mary
pavlovna
she
wrote
that
kryltzoffs
attack
was
more
serious
than
they
had
imagined
we
wished
him
to
be
left
behind
and
to
remain
with
him
but
this
has
not
been
allowed
so
that
we
shall
take
him
on
but
we
fear
the
worst
please
arrange
so
that
if
he
should
be
left
in
the
next
town
one
of
us
might
remain
with
him
if
in
order
to
get
the
permission
to
stay
i
should
be
obliged
to
get
married
to
him
i
am
of
course
ready
to
do
so
nekhludoff
sent
the
young
labourer
to
the
post
station
to
order
horses
and
began
packing
up
hurriedly
before
he
had
drunk
his
second
tumbler
of
tea
the
threehorsed
postcart
drove
up
to
the
porch
with
ringing
bells
the
wheels
rattling
on
the
frozen
mud
as
on
stones
nekhludoff
paid
the
fatnecked
landlady
hurried
out
and
got
into
the
cart
and
gave
orders
to
the
driver
to
go
on
as
fast
as
possible
so
as
to
overtake
the
gang
just
past
the
gates
of
the
commune
pasture
ground
they
did
overtake
the
carts
loaded
with
sacks
and
the
sick
prisoners
as
they
rattled
over
the
frozen
mud
that
was
just
beginning
to
be
rolled
smooth
by
the
wheels
the
officer
was
not
there
he
had
gone
in
advance
the
soldiers
who
had
evidently
been
drinking
followed
by
the
side
of
the
road
chatting
merrily
there
were
a
great
many
carts
in
each
of
the
first
carts
sat
six
invalid
criminal
convicts
close
packed
on
each
of
the
last
two
were
three
political
prisoners
novodvoroff
grabetz
and
kondratieff
sat
on
one
rintzeva
nabatoff
and
the
woman
to
whom
mary
pavlovna
had
given
up
her
own
place
on
the
other
and
on
one
of
the
carts
lay
kryltzoff
on
a
heap
of
hay
with
a
pillow
under
his
head
and
mary
pavlovna
sat
by
him
on
the
edge
of
the
cart
nekhludoff
ordered
his
driver
to
stop
got
out
and
went
up
to
kryltzoff
one
of
the
tipsy
soldiers
waved
his
hand
towards
nekhludoff
but
he
paid
no
attention
and
started
walking
by
kryltzoffs
side
holding
on
to
the
side
of
the
cart
with
his
hand
dressed
in
a
sheepskin
coat
with
a
fur
cap
on
his
head
and
his
mouth
bound
up
with
a
handkerchief
he
seemed
paler
and
thinner
than
ever
his
beautiful
eyes
looked
very
large
and
brilliant
shaken
from
side
to
side
by
the
jottings
of
the
cart
he
lay
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
nekhludoff
but
when
asked
about
his
health
he
only
closed
his
eyes
and
angrily
shook
his
head
all
his
energy
seemed
to
be
needed
in
order
to
bear
the
jolting
of
the
cart
mary
pavlovna
was
on
the
other
side
she
exchanged
a
significant
glance
with
nekhludoff
which
expressed
all
her
anxiety
about
kryltzoffs
state
and
then
began
to
talk
at
once
in
a
cheerful
manner
it
seems
the
officer
is
ashamed
of
himself
she
shouted
so
as
to
be
heard
above
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
bousovkins
manacles
have
been
removed
and
he
is
carrying
his
little
girl
himself
katusha
and
simonson
are
with
him
and
vera
too
she
has
taken
my
place
kryltzoff
said
something
that
could
not
be
heard
because
of
the
noise
and
frowning
in
the
effort
to
repress
his
cough
shook
his
head
then
nekhludoff
stooped
towards
him
so
as
to
hear
and
kryltzoff
freeing
his
mouth
of
the
handkerchief
whispered
much
better
now
only
not
to
catch
cold
nekhludoff
nodded
in
acquiescence
and
again
exchanged
a
glance
with
mary
pavlovna
how
about
the
problem
of
the
three
bodies
whispered
kryltzoff
smiling
with
great
difficulty
the
solution
is
difficult
nekhludoff
did
not
understand
but
mary
pavlovna
explained
that
he
meant
the
wellknown
mathematical
problem
which
defined
the
position
of
the
sun
moon
and
earth
which
kryltzoff
compared
to
the
relations
between
nekhludoff
katusha
and
simonson
kryltzoff
nodded
to
show
that
mary
pavlovna
had
explained
his
joke
correctly
the
decision
does
not
lie
with
me
nekhludoff
said
did
you
get
my
note
will
you
do
it
mary
pavlovna
asked
certainly
answered
nekhludoff
and
noticing
a
look
of
displeasure
on
kryltzoffs
face
he
returned
to
his
conveyance
and
holding
with
both
hands
to
the
sides
of
the
cart
got
in
which
jolted
with
him
over
the
ruts
of
the
rough
road
he
passed
the
gang
which
with
its
grey
cloaks
and
sheepskin
coats
chains
and
manacles
stretched
over
threequarters
of
a
mile
of
the
road
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
nekhludoff
noticed
katushas
blue
shawl
vera
doukhovas
black
coat
and
simonsons
crochet
cap
white
worsted
stockings
with
bands
like
those
of
sandals
tied
round
him
simonson
was
walking
with
the
woman
and
carrying
on
a
heated
discussion
when
they
saw
nekhludoff
they
bowed
to
him
and
simonson
raised
his
hat
in
a
solemn
manner
nekhludoff
having
nothing
to
say
did
not
stop
and
was
soon
ahead
of
the
carts
having
got
again
on
to
a
smoother
part
of
the
road
they
drove
still
more
quickly
but
they
had
continually
to
turn
aside
to
let
pass
long
rows
of
carts
that
were
moving
along
the
road
in
both
directions
the
road
which
was
cut
up
by
deep
ruts
lay
through
a
thick
pine
forest
mingled
with
birch
trees
and
larches
bright
with
yellow
leaves
they
had
not
yet
shed
by
the
time
nekhludoff
had
passed
about
half
the
gang
he
reached
the
end
of
the
forest
fields
now
lay
stretched
along
both
sides
of
the
road
and
the
crosses
and
cupolas
of
a
monastery
appeared
in
the
distance
the
clouds
had
dispersed
and
it
had
cleared
up
completely
the
leaves
the
frozen
puddles
and
the
gilt
crosses
and
cupolas
of
the
monastery
glittered
brightly
in
the
sun
that
had
risen
above
the
forest
a
little
to
the
right
mountains
began
to
gleam
white
in
the
bluegrey
distance
and
the
trap
entered
a
large
village
the
village
street
was
full
of
people
both
russians
and
other
nationalities
wearing
peculiar
caps
and
cloaks
tipsy
men
and
women
crowded
and
chattered
round
booths
traktirs
public
houses
and
carts
the
vicinity
of
a
town
was
noticeable
giving
a
pull
and
a
lash
of
the
whip
to
the
horse
on
his
right
the
driver
sat
down
sideways
on
the
right
edge
of
the
seat
so
that
the
reins
hung
over
that
side
and
with
evident
desire
of
showing
off
he
drove
quickly
down
to
the
river
which
had
to
be
crossed
by
a
ferry
the
raft
was
coming
towards
them
and
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
river
about
twenty
carts
were
waiting
to
cross
nekhludoff
had
not
long
to
wait
the
raft
which
had
been
pulled
far
up
the
stream
quickly
approached
the
landing
carried
by
the
swift
waters
the
tall
silent
broadshouldered
muscular
ferryman
dressed
in
sheepskins
threw
the
ropes
and
moored
the
raft
with
practised
hand
landed
the
carts
that
were
on
it
and
put
those
that
were
waiting
on
the
bank
on
board
the
whole
raft
was
filled
with
vehicles
and
horses
shuffling
at
the
sight
of
the
water
the
broad
swift
river
splashed
against
the
sides
of
the
ferryboats
tightening
their
moorings
when
the

was
full

on

could
hear
nothing

the
tramp

the

a
worthless
tramp
nekhludoff
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
raft
looking
at
the
broad
river
two
pictures
kept
rising
up
in
his
mind
one
that
of
kryltzoff
unprepared
for
death
and
dying
made
a
heavy
sorrowful
impression
on
him
the
other
that
of
katusha
full
of
energy
having
gained
the
love
of
such
a
man
as
simonson
and
found
a
true
and
solid
path
towards
righteousness
should
have
been
pleasant
yet
it
also
created
a
heavy
impression
on
nekhludoffs
mind
and
he
could
not
conquer
this
impression
the
vibrating
sounds
of
a
big
brass
bell
reached
them
from
the
town
nekhludoffs
driver
who
stood
by
his
side
and
the
other
men
on
the
raft
raised
their
caps
and
crossed
themselves
all
except
a
short
dishevelled
old
man
who
stood
close
to
the
railway
and
whom
nekhludoff
had
not
noticed
before
he
did
not
cross
himself
but
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
nekhludoff
this
old
man
wore
a
patched
coat
cloth
trousers
and
worn
and
patched
shoes
he
had
a
small
wallet
on
his
back
and
a
high
fur
cap
with
the
fur
much
rubbed
on
his
head
why
dont
you
pray
old
chap
asked
nekhludoffs
driver
as
he
replaced
and
straightened
his
cap
are
you
unbaptized
whos
one
to
pray
to
asked
the
old
man
quickly
in
a
determinately
aggressive
tone
to
whom
to
god
of
course
said
the
driver
sarcastically
and
you
just
show
me
where
he
is
that
god
there
was
something
so
serious
and
firm
in
the
expression
of
the
old
man
that
the
driver
felt
that
he
had
to
do
with
a
strongminded
man
and
was
a
bit
abashed
and
trying
not
to
show
this
not
to
be
silenced
and
not
to
be
put
to
shame
before
the
crowd
that
was
observing
them
he
answered
quickly
where
in
heaven
of
course
and
have
you
been
up
there
whether
ive
been
or
not
every
one
knows
that
you
must
pray
to
god
no
one
has
ever
seen
god
at
any
time
the
only
begotten
son
who
is
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
he
hath
declared
him
said
the
old
man
in
the
same
rapid
manner
and
with
a
severe
frown
on
his
brow
its
clear
you
are
not
a
christian
but
a
hole
worshipper
you
pray
to
a
hole
said
the
driver
shoving
the
handle
of
his
whip
into
his
girdle
pulling
straight
the
harness
on
one
of
the
horses
some
one
laughed
what
is
your
faith
dad
asked
a
middleaged
man
who
stood
by
his
cart
on
the
same
side
of
the
raft
i
have
no
kind
of
faith
because
i
believe
no
oneno
one
but
myself
said
the
old
man
as
quickly
and
decidedly
as
before
how
can
you
believe
yourself
nekhludoff
asked
entering
into
a
conversation
with
him
you
might
make
a
mistake
never
in
your
life
the
old
man
said
decidedly
with
a
toss
of
his
head
then
why
are
there
different
faiths
nekhludoff
asked
its
just
because
men
believe
others
and
do
not
believe
themselves
that
there
are
different
faiths
i
also
believed
others
and
lost
myself
as
in
a
swamplost
myself
so
that
i
had
no
hope
of
finding
my
way
out
old
believers
and
new
believers
and
judaisers
and
khlysty
and
popovitzy
and
bespopovitzy
and
avstriaks
and
molokans
and
skoptzyevery
faith
praises
itself
only
and
so
they
all
creep
about
like
blind
puppies
there
are
many
faiths
but
the
spirit
is
onein
me
and
in
you
and
in
him
so
that
if
every
one
believes
himself
all
will
be
united
every
one
be
himself
and
all
will
be
as
one
the
old
man
spoke
loudly
and
often
looked
round
evidently
wishing
that
as
many
as
possible
should
hear
him
and
have
you
long
held
this
faith
i
a
long
time
this
is
the
twentythird
year
that
they
persecute
me
persecute
you
how
as
they
persecuted
christ
so
they
persecute
me
they
seize
me
and
take
me
before
the
courts
and
before
the
priests
the
scribes
and
the
pharisees
once
they
put
me
into
a
madhouse
but
they
can
do
nothing
because
i
am
free
they
say
what
is
your
name
thinking
i
shall
name
myself
but
i
do
not
give
myself
a
name
i
have
given
up
everything
i
have
no
name
no
place
no
country
nor
anything
i
am
just
myself
what
is
your
name
man
how
old
are
you
i
say
i
do
not
count
my
years
and
cannot
count
them
because
i
always
was
i
always
shall
be
who
are
your
parents
i
have
no
parents
except
god
and
mother
earth
god
is
my
father
and
the
tsar
do
you
recognise
the
tsar
they
say
i
say
why
not
he
is
his
own
tsar
and
i
am
my
own
tsar
wheres
the
good
of
talking
to
him
they
say
and
i
say
i
do
not
ask
you
to
talk
to
me
and
so
they
begin
tormenting
me
and
where
are
you
going
now
asked
nekhludoff
where
god
will
lead
me
i
work
when
i
can
find
work
and
when
i
cant
i
beg
the
old
man
noticed
that
the
raft
was
approaching
the
bank
and
stopped
looking
round
at
the
bystanders
with
a
look
of
triumph
nekhludoff
got
out
his
purse
and
offered
some
money
to
the
old
man
but
he
refused
saying
i
do
not
accept
this
sort
of
thingbread
i
do
accept
well
then
excuse
me
there
is
nothing
to
excuse
you
have
not
offended
me
and
it
is
not
possible
to
offend
me
and
the
old
man
put
the
wallet
he
had
taken
off
again
on
his
back
meanwhile
the
postcart
had
been
landed
and
the
horses
harnessed
i
wonder
you
should
care
to
talk
to
him
sir
said
the
driver
when
nekhludoff
having
tipped
the
bowing
ferryman
got
into
the
cart
again
he
is
just
a
worthless
tramp
chapter
xxii
nekhludoff
sees
the
general
when
they
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
bank
the
driver
turned
to
nekhludoff
which
hotel
am
i
to
drive
to
which
is
the
best
nothing
could
be
better
than
the
siberian
but
dukeoffs
is
also
good
drive
to
whichever
you
like
the
driver
again
seated
himself
sideways
and
drove
faster
the
town
was
like
all
such
towns
the
same
kind
of
houses
with
attic
windows
and
green
roofs
the
same
kind
of
cathedral
the
same
kind
of
shops
and
stores
in
the
principal
street
and
even
the
same
kind
of
policemen
only
the
houses
were
almost
all
of
them
wooden
and
the
streets
were
not
paved
in
one
of
the
chief
streets
the
driver
stopped
at
the
door
of
an
hotel
but
there
was
no
room
to
be
had
so
he
drove
to
another
and
here
nekhludoff
after
two
months
found
himself
once
again
in
surroundings
such
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
as
far
as
comfort
and
cleanliness
went
though
the
room
he
was
shown
to
was
simple
enough
yet
nekhludoff
felt
greatly
relieved
to
be
there
after
two
months
of
postcarts
country
inns
and
halting
stations
his
first
business
was
to
clean
himself
of
the
lice
which
he
had
never
been
able
to
get
thoroughly
rid
of
after
visiting
a
halting
station
when
he
had
unpacked
he
went
to
the
russian
bath
after
which
he
made
himself
fit
to
be
seen
in
a
town
put
on
a
starched
shirt
trousers
that
had
got
rather
creased
along
the
seams
a
frockcoat
and
an
overcoat
and
drove
to
the
governor
of
the
district
the
hotelkeeper
called
an
isvostchik
whose
wellfed
kirghiz
horse
and
vibrating
trap
soon
brought
nekhludoff
to
the
large
porch
of
a
big
building
in
front
of
which
stood
sentinels
and
a
policeman
the
house
had
a
garden
in
front
and
at
the
back
among
the
naked
branches
of
aspen
and
birch
trees
there
grew
thick
and
dark
green
pines
and
firs
the
general
was
not
well
and
did
not
receive
but
nekhludoff
asked
the
footman
to
hand
in
his
card
all
the
same
and
the
footman
came
back
with
a
favourable
reply
you
are
asked
to
come
in
the
hall
the
footman
the
orderly
the
staircase
the
dancingroom
with
its
wellpolished
floor
were
very
much
the
same
as
in
petersburg
only
more
imposing
and
rather
dirtier
nekhludoff
was
shown
into
the
cabinet
the
general
a
bloated
potatonosed
man
with
a
sanguine
disposition
large
bumps
on
his
forehead
bald
head
and
puffs
under
his
eyes
sat
wrapped
in
a
tartar
silk
dressinggown
smoking
a
cigarette
and
sipping
his
tea
out
of
a
tumbler
in
a
silver
holder
how
do
you
do
sir
excuse
my
dressinggown
it
is
better
so
than
if
i
had
not
received
you
at
all
he
said
pulling
up
his
dressinggown
over
his
fat
neck
with
its
deep
folds
at
the
nape
i
am
not
quite
well
and
do
not
go
out
what
has
brought
you
to
our
remote
region
i
am
accompanying
a
gang
of
prisoners
among
whom
there
is
a
person
closely
connected
with
me
said
nekhludoff
and
now
i
have
come
to
see
your
excellency
partly
in
behalf
of
this
person
and
partly
about
another
business
the
general
took
a
whiff
and
a
sip
of
tea
put
his
cigarette
into
a
malachite
ashpan
with
his
narrow
eyes
fixed
on
nekhludoff
listening
seriously
he
only
interrupted
him
once
to
offer
him
a
cigarette
the
general
belonged
to
the
learned
type
of
military
men
who
believed
that
liberal
and
humane
views
can
be
reconciled
with
their
profession
but
being
by
nature
a
kind
and
intelligent
man
he
soon
felt
the
impossibility
of
such
a
reconciliation
so
as
not
to
feel
the
inner
discord
in
which
he
was
living
he
gave
himself
up
more
and
more
to
the
habit
of
drinking
which
is
so
widely
spread
among
military
men
and
was
now
suffering
from
what
doctors
term
alcoholism
he
was
imbued
with
alcohol
and
if
he
drank
any
kind
of
liquor
it
made
him
tipsy
yet
strong
drink
was
an
absolute
necessity
to
him
he
could
not
live
without
it
so
he
was
quite
drunk
every
evening
but
had
grown
so
used
to
this
state
that
he
did
not
reel
nor
talk
any
special
nonsense
and
if
he
did
talk
nonsense
it
was
accepted
as
words
of
wisdom
because
of
the
important
and
high
position
which
he
occupied
only
in
the
morning
just
at
the
time
nekhludoff
came
to
see
him
he
was
like
a
reasonable
being
could
understand
what
was
said
to
him
and
fulfil
more
or
less
aptly
a
proverb
he
was
fond
of
repeating
hes
tipsy
but
hes
wise
so
hes
pleasant
in
two
ways
the
higher
authorities
knew
he
was
a
drunkard
but
he
was
more
educated
than
the
rest
though
his
education
had
stopped
at
the
spot
where
drunkenness
had
got
hold
of
him
he
was
bold
adroit
of
imposing
appearance
and
showed
tact
even
when
tipsy
therefore
he
was
appointed
and
was
allowed
to
retain
so
public
and
responsible
an
office
nekhludoff
told
him
that
the
person
he
was
interested
in
was
a
woman
that
she
was
sentenced
though
innocent
and
that
a
petition
had
been
sent
to
the
emperor
in
her
behalf
yes
well
said
the
general
i
was
promised
in
petersburg
that
the
news
concerning
her
fate
should
be
sent
to
me
not
later
than
this
month
and
to
this
place
the
general
stretched
his
hand
with
its
stumpy
fingers
towards
the
table
and
rang
a
bell
still
looking
at
nekhludoff
and
puffing
at
his
cigarette
so
i
would
like
to
ask
you
that
this
woman
should
be
allowed
to
remain
here
until
the
answer
to
her
petition
comes
the
footman
an
orderly
in
uniform
came
in
ask
if
anna
vasilievna
is
up
said
the
general
to
the
orderly
and
bring
some
more
tea
then
turning
to
nekhludoff
yes
and
what
else
my
other
request
concerns
a
political
prisoner
who
is
with
the
same
gang
dear
me
said
the
general
with
a
significant
shake
of
the
head
he
is
seriously
illdying
and
he
will
probably
be
left
here
in
the
hospital
so
one
of
the
women
prisoners
would
like
to
stay
behind
with
him
she
is
no
relation
of
his
no
but
she
is
willing
to
marry
him
if
that
will
enable
her
to
remain
with
him
the
general
looked
fixedly
with
twinkling
eyes
at
his
interlocutor
and
evidently
with
a
wish
to
discomfit
him
listened
smoking
in
silence
when
nekhludoff
had
finished
the
general
took
a
book
off
the
table
and
wetting
his
finger
quickly
turned
over
the
pages
and
found
the
statute
relating
to
marriage
what
is
she
sentenced
to
he
asked
looking
up
from
the
book
she
to
hard
labour
well
then
the
position
of
one
sentenced
to
that
cannot
be
bettered
by
marriage
yes
but
excuse
me
even
if
a
free
man
should
marry
her
she
would
have
to
serve
her
term
the
question
in
such
cases
is
whose
is
the
heavier
punishment
hers
or
his
they
are
both
sentenced
to
hard
labour
very
well
so
they
are
quits
said
the
general
with
a
laugh
shes
got
what
he
has
only
as
he
is
sick
he
may
be
left
behind
and
of
course
what
can
be
done
to
lighten
his
fate
shall
be
done
but
as
for
her
even
if
she
did
marry
him
she
could
not
remain
behind
the
generaless
is
having
her
coffee
the
footman
announced
the
general
nodded
and
continued
however
i
shall
think
about
it
what
are
their
names
put
them
down
here
nekhludoff
wrote
down
the
names
nekhludoffs
request
to
be
allowed
to
see
the
dying
man
the
general
answered
by
saying
neither
can
i
do
that
of
course
i
do
not
suspect
you
but
you
take
an
interest
in
him
and
in
the
others
and
you
have
money
and
here
with
us
anything
can
be
done
with
money
i
have
been
told
to
put
down
bribery
but
how
can
i
put
down
bribery
when
everybody
takes
bribes
and
the
lower
their
rank
the
more
ready
they
are
to
be
bribed
how
can
one
find
it
out
across
more
than
three
thousand
miles
there
any
official
is
a
little
tsar
just
as
i
am
here
and
he
laughed
you
have
in
all
likelihood
been
to
see
the
political
prisoners
you
gave
money
and
got
permission
to
see
them
he
said
with
a
smile
is
it
not
so
yes
it
is
i
quite
understand
that
you
had
to
do
it
you
pity
a
political
prisoner
and
wish
to
see
him
and
the
inspector
or
the
convoy
soldier
accepts
because
he
has
a
salary
of
twice
twenty
copecks
and
a
family
and
he
cant
help
accepting
it
in
his
place
and
yours
i
should
have
acted
in
the
same
way
as
you
and
he
did
but
in
my
position
i
do
not
permit
myself
to
swerve
an
inch
from
the
letter
of
the
law
just
because
i
am
a
man
and
might
be
influenced
by
pity
but
i
am
a
member
of
the
executive
and
i
have
been
placed
in
a
position
of
trust
on
certain
conditions
and
these
conditions
i
must
carry
out
well
so
this
business
is
finished
and
now
let
us
hear
what
is
going
on
in
the
metropolis
and
the
general
began
questioning
with
the
evident
desire
to
hear
the
news
and
to
show
how
very
human
he
was
chapter
xxiii
the
sentence
commuted
bytheway
where
are
you
staying
asked
the
general
as
he
was
taking
leave
of
nekhludoff
at
dukes
well
its
horrid
enough
there
come
and
dine
with
us
at
five
oclock
you
speak
english
yes
i
do
thats
good
you
see
an
english
traveller
has
just
arrived
here
he
is
studying
the
question
of
transportation
and
examining
the
prisons
of
siberia
well
he
is
dining
with
us
tonight
and
you
come
and
meet
him
we
dine
at
five
and
my
wife
expects
punctuality
then
i
shall
also
give
you
an
answer
what
to
do
about
that
woman
and
perhaps
it
may
be
possible
to
leave
some
one
behind
with
the
sick
prisoner
having
made
his
bow
to
the
general
nekhludoff
drove
to
the
postoffice
feeling
himself
in
an
extremely
animated
and
energetic
frame
of
mind
the
postoffice
was
a
lowvaulted
room
several
officials
sat
behind
a
counter
serving
the
people
of
whom
there
was
quite
a
crowd
one
official
sat
with
his
head
bent
to
one
side
and
kept
stamping
the
envelopes
which
he
slipped
dexterously
under
the
stamp
nekhludoff
had
not
long
to
wait
as
soon
as
he
had
given
his
name
everything
that
had
come
for
him
by
post
was
at
once
handed
to
him
there
was
a
good
deal
letters
and
money
and
books
and
the
last
number
of
fatherland
notes
nekhludoff
took
all
these
things
to
a
wooden
bench
on
which
a
soldier
with
a
book
in
his
hand
sat
waiting
for
something
took
the
seat
by
his
side
and
began
sorting
the
letters
among
them
was
one
registered
letter
in
a
fine
envelope
with
a
distinctly
stamped
bright
red
seal
he
broke
the
seal
and
seeing
a
letter
from
selenin
and
some
official
paper
inside
the
envelope
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
face
and
his
heart
stood
still
it
was
the
answer
to
katushas
petition
what
would
that
answer
be
nekhludoff
glanced
hurriedly
through
the
letter
written
in
an
illegibly
small
hard
and
cramped
hand
and
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
the
answer
was
a
favourable
one
dear
friend
wrote
selenin
our
last
talk
has
made
a
profound
impression
on
me
you
were
right
concerning
maslova
i
looked
carefully
through
the
case
and
see
that
shocking
injustice
has
been
done
her
it
could
be
remedied
only
by
the
committee
of
petitions
before
which
you
laid
it
i
managed
to
assist
at
the
examination
of
the
case
and
i
enclose
herewith
the
copy
of
the
mitigation
of
the
sentence
your
aunt
the
countess
katerina
ivanovna
gave
me
the
address
which
i
am
sending
this
to
the
original
document
has
been
sent
to
the
place
where
she
was
imprisoned
before
her
trial
and
will
from
there
he
probably
sent
at
once
to
the
principal
government
office
in
siberia
i
hasten
to
communicate
this
glad
news
to
you
and
warmly
press
your
hand
yours
selenin
the
document
ran
thus
his
majestys
office
for
the
reception
of
petitions
addressed
to
his
imperial
namehere
followed
the
dateby
order
of
the
chief
of
his
majestys
office
for
the
reception
of
petitions
addressed
to
his
imperial
name
the
meschanka
katerina
maslova
is
hereby
informed
that
his
imperial
majesty
with
reference
to
her
most
loyal
petition
condescending
to
her
request
deigns
to
order
that
her
sentence
to
hard
labour
should
be
commuted
to
one
of
exile
to
the
less
distant
districts
of
siberia
this
was
joyful
and
important
news
all
that
nekhludoff
could
have
hoped
for
katusha
and
for
himself
also
had
happened
it
was
true
that
the
new
position
she
was
in
brought
new
complications
with
it
while
she
was
a
convict
marriage
with
her
could
only
be
fictitious
and
would
have
had
no
meaning
except
that
he
would
have
been
in
a
position
to
alleviate
her
condition
and
now
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
their
living
together
and
nekhludoff
had
not
prepared
himself
for
that
and
besides
what
of
her
relations
to
simonson
what
was
the
meaning
of
her
words
yesterday
if
she
consented
to
a
union
with
simonson
would
it
be
well
he
could
not
unravel
all
these
questions
and
gave
up
thinking
about
it
it
will
all
clear
itself
up
later
on
he
thought
i
must
not
think
about
it
now
but
convey
the
glad
news
to
her
as
soon
as
possible
and
set
her
free
he
thought
that
the
copy
of
the
document
he
had
received
would
suffice
so
when
he
left
the
postoffice
he
told
the
isvostchik
to
drive
him
to
the
prison
though
he
had
received
no
order
from
the
governor
to
visit
the
prison
that
morning
he
knew
by
experience
that
it
was
easy
to
get
from
the
subordinates
what
the
higher
officials
would
not
grant
so
now
he
meant
to
try
and
get
into
the
prison
to
bring
katusha
the
joyful
news
and
perhaps
to
get
her
set
free
and
at
the
same
time
to
inquire
about
kryltzoffs
state
of
health
and
tell
him
and
mary
pavlovna
what
the
general
had
said
the
prison
inspector
was
a
tall
imposinglooking
man
with
moustaches
and
whiskers
that
twisted
towards
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
received
nekhludoff
very
gravely
and
told
him
plainly
that
he
could
not
grant
an
outsider
the
permission
to
interview
the
prisoners
without
a
special
order
from
his
chief
to
nekhludoffs
remark
that
he
had
been
allowed
to
visit
the
prisoners
even
in
the
cities
he
answered
that
may
be
so
but
i
do
not
allow
it
and
his
tone
implied
you
city
gentlemen
may
think
to
surprise
and
perplex
us
but
we
in
eastern
siberia
also
know
what
the
law
is
and
may
even
teach
it
you
the
copy
of
a
document
straight
from
the
emperors
own
office
did
not
have
any
effect
on
the
prison
inspector
either
he
decidedly
refused
to
let
nekhludoff
come
inside
the
prison
walls
he
only
smiled
contemptuously
at
nekhludoffs
naive
conclusion
that
the
copy
he
had
received
would
suffice
to
set
maslova
free
and
declared
that
a
direct
order
from
his
own
superiors
would
be
needed
before
any
one
could
be
set
at
liberty
the
only
things
he
agreed
to
do
were
to
communicate
to
maslova
that
a
mitigation
had
arrived
for
her
and
to
promise
that
he
would
not
detain
her
an
hour
after
the
order
from
his
chief
to
liberate
her
would
arrive
he
would
also
give
no
news
of
kryltzoff
saying
he
could
not
even
tell
if
there
was
such
a
prisoner
and
so
nekhludoff
having
accomplished
next
to
nothing
got
into
his
trap
and
drove
back
to
his
hotel
the
strictness
of
the
inspector
was
chiefly
due
to
the
fact
that
an
epidemic
of
typhus
had
broken
out
in
the
prison
owing
to
twice
the
number
of
persons
that
it
was
intended
for
being
crowded
in
it
the
isvostchik
who
drove
nekhludoff
said
quite
a
lot
of
people
are
dying
in
the
prison
every
day
some
kind
of
disease
having
sprung
up
among
them
so
that
as
many
as
twenty
were
buried
in
one
day
chapter
xxiv
the
generals
household
in
spite
of
his
ineffectual
attempt
at
the
prison
nekhludoff
still
in
the
same
vigorous
energetic
frame
of
mind
went
to
the
governors
office
to
see
if
the
original
of
the
document
had
arrived
for
maslova
it
had
not
arrived
so
nekhludoff
went
back
to
the
hotel
and
wrote
without
delay
to
selenin
and
the
advocate
about
it
when
he
had
finished
writing
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
saw
it
was
time
to
go
to
the
generals
dinner
party
on
the
way
he
again
began
wondering
how
katusha
would
receive
the
news
of
the
mitigation
of
her
sentence
where
she
would
be
settled
how
he
should
live
with
her
what
about
simonson
what
would
his
relations
to
her
be
he
remembered
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
her
and
this
reminded
him
of
her
past
i
must
forget
it
for
the
present
he
thought
and
again
hastened
to
drive
her
out
of
his
mind
when
the
time
comes
i
shall
see
he
said
to
himself
and
began
to
think
of
what
he
ought
to
say
to
the
general
the
dinner
at
the
generals
with
the
luxury
habitual
to
the
lives
of
the
wealthy
and
those
of
high
rank
to
which
nekhludoff
had
been
accustomed
was
extremely
enjoyable
after
he
had
been
so
long
deprived
not
only
of
luxury
but
even
of
the
most
ordinary
comforts
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
a
petersburg
grande
dame
of
the
old
school
a
maid
of
honour
at
the
court
of
nicholas
i
who
spoke
french
quite
naturally
and
russian
very
unnaturally
she
held
herself
very
erect
and
moving
her
hands
she
kept
her
elbows
close
to
her
waist
she
was
quietly
and
somewhat
sadly
considerate
for
her
husband
and
extremely
kind
to
all
her
visitors
though
with
a
tinge
of
difference
in
her
behaviour
according
to
their
position
she
received
nekhludoff
as
if
he
were
one
of
them
and
her
fine
almost
imperceptible
flattery
made
him
once
again
aware
of
his
virtues
and
gave
him
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
she
made
him
feel
that
she
knew
of
that
honest
though
rather
singular
step
of
his
which
had
brought
him
to
siberia
and
held
him
to
be
an
exceptional
man
this
refined
flattery
and
the
elegance
and
luxury
of
the
generals
house
had
the
effect
of
making
nekhludoff
succumb
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
handsome
surroundings
the
delicate
dishes
and
the
ease
and
pleasure
of
intercourse
with
educated
people
of
his
own
class
so
that
the
surroundings
in
the
midst
of
which
he
had
lived
for
the
last
months
seemed
a
dream
from
which
he
had
awakened
to
reality
besides
those
of
the
household
the
generals
daughter
and
her
husband
and
an
aidedecamp
there
were
an
englishman
a
merchant
interested
in
gold
mines
and
the
governor
of
a
distant
siberian
town
all
these
people
seemed
pleasant
to
nekhludoff
the
englishman
a
healthy
man
with
a
rosy
complexion
who
spoke
very
bad
french
but
whose
command
of
his
own
language
was
very
good
and
oratorically
impressive
who
had
seen
a
great
deal
was
very
interesting
to
listen
to
when
he
spoke
about
america
india
japan
and
siberia
the
young
merchant
interested
in
the
gold
mines
the
son
of
a
peasant
whose
evening
dress
was
made
in
london
who
had
diamond
studs
to
his
shirt
possessed
a
fine
library
contributed
freely
to
philanthropic
work
and
held
liberal
european
views
seemed
pleasant
to
nekhludoff
as
a
sample
of
a
quite
new
and
good
type
of
civilised
european
culture
grafted
on
a
healthy
uncultivated
peasant
stem
the
governor
of
the
distant
siberian
town
was
that
same
man
who
had
been
so
much
talked
about
in
petersburg
at
the
time
nekhludoff
was
there
he
was
plump
with
thin
curly
hair
soft
blue
eyes
carefullytended
white
hands
with
rings
on
the
fingers
a
pleasant
smile
and
very
big
in
the
lower
part
of
his
body
the
master
of
the
house
valued
this
governor
because
of
all
the
officials
he
was
the
only
one
who
would
not
be
bribed
the
mistress
of
the
house
who
was
very
fond
of
music
and
a
very
good
pianist
herself
valued
him
because
he
was
a
good
musician
and
played
duets
with
her
nekhludoff
was
in
such
good
humour
that
even
this
man
was
not
unpleasant
to
him
in
spite
of
what
he
knew
of
his
vices
the
bright
energetic
aidedecamp
with
his
bluey
grey
chin
who
was
continually
offering
his
services
pleased
nekhludoff
by
his
good
nature
but
it
was
the
charming
young
couple
the
generals
daughter
and
her
husband
who
pleased
nekhludoff
best
the
daughter
was
a
plainlooking
simpleminded
young
woman
wholly
absorbed
in
her
two
children
her
husband
whom
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
and
married
after
a
long
struggle
with
her
parents
was
a
liberal
who
had
taken
honours
at
the
moscow
university
a
modest
and
intellectual
young
man
in
government
service
who
made
up
statistics
and
studied
chiefly
the
foreign
tribes
which
he
liked
and
tried
to
save
from
dying
out
all
of
them
were
not
only
kind
and
attentive
to
nekhludoff
but
evidently
pleased
to
see
him
as
a
new
and
interesting
acquaintance
the
general
who
came
in
to
dinner
in
uniform
and
with
a
white
cross
round
his
neck
greeted
nekhludoff
as
a
friend
and
asked
the
visitors
to
the
side
table
to
take
a
glass
of
vodka
and
something
to
whet
their
appetites
the
general
asked
nekhludoff
what
he
had
been
doing
since
he
left
that
morning
and
nekhludoff
told
him
he
had
been
to
the
postoffice
and
received
the
news
of
the
mitigation
of
that
persons
sentence
that
he
had
spoken
of
in
the
morning
and
again
asked
for
a
permission
to
visit
the
prison
the
general
apparently
displeased
that
business
should
be
mentioned
at
dinner
frowned
and
said
nothing
have
a
glass
of
vodka
he
said
addressing
the
englishman
who
had
just
come
up
to
the
table
the
englishman
drank
a
glass
and
said
he
had
been
to
see
the
cathedral
and
the
factory
but
would
like
to
visit
the
great
transportation
prison
oh
that
will
just
fit
in
said
the
general
to
nekhludoff
you
will
be
able
to
go
together
give
them
a
pass
he
added
turning
to
his
aidedecamp
when
would
you
like
to
go
nekhludoff
asked
i
prefer
visiting
the
prisons
in
the
evening
the
englishman
answered
all
are
indoors
and
there
is
no
preparation
you
find
them
all
as
they
are
ah
he
would
like
to
see
it
in
all
its
glory
let
him
do
so
i
have
written
about
it
and
no
attention
has
been
paid
to
it
let
him
find
out
from
foreign
publications
the
general
said
and
went
up
to
the
dinner
table
where
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
showing
the
visitors
their
places
nekhludoff
sat
between
his
hostess
and
the
englishman
in
front
of
him
sat
the
generals
daughter
and
the
exdirector
of
the
government
department
in
petersburg
the
conversation
at
dinner
was
carried
on
by
fits
and
starts
now
it
was
india
that
the
englishman
talked
about
now
the
tonkin
expedition
that
the
general
strongly
disapproved
of
now
the
universal
bribery
and
corruption
in
siberia
all
these
topics
did
not
interest
nekhludoff
much
but
after
dinner
over
their
coffee
nekhludoff
and
the
englishman
began
a
very
interesting
conversation
about
gladstone
and
nekhludoff
thought
he
had
said
many
clever
things
which
were
noticed
by
his
interlocutor
and
nekhludoff
felt
it
more
and
more
pleasant
to
be
sipping
his
coffee
seated
in
an
easychair
among
amiable
wellbred
people
and
when
at
the
englishmans
request
the
hostess
went
up
to
the
piano
with
the
exdirector
of
the
government
department
and
they
began
to
play
in
wellpractised
style
beethovens
fifth
symphony
nekhludoff
fell
into
a
mental
state
of
perfect
selfsatisfaction
to
which
he
had
long
been
a
stranger
as
though
he
had
only
just
found
out
what
a
good
fellow
he
was
the
grand
piano
was
a
splendid
instrument
the
symphony
was
well
performed
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
nekhludoff
who
knew
and
liked
that
symphony
listening
to
the
beautiful
andante
he
felt
a
tickling
in
his
nose
he
was
so
touched
by
his
many
virtues
nekhludoff
thanked
his
hostess
for
the
enjoyment
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
for
so
long
and
was
about
to
say
goodbye
and
go
when
the
daughter
of
the
house
came
up
to
him
with
a
determined
look
and
said
with
a
blush
you
asked
about
my
children
would
you
like
to
see
them
she
thinks
that
everybody
wants
to
see
her
children
said
her
mother
smiling
at
her
daughters
winning
tactlessness
the
prince
is
not
at
all
interested
on
the
contrary
i
am
very
much
interested
said
nekhludoff
touched
by
this
overflowing
happy
motherlove
please
let
me
see
them
shes
taking
the
prince
to
see
her
babies
the
general
shouted
laughing
from
the
cardtable
where
he
sat
with
his
soninlaw
the
mine
owner
and
the
aidedecamp
go
go
pay
your
tribute
the
young
woman
visibly
excited
by
the
thought
that
judgment
was
about
to
be
passed
on
her
children
went
quickly
towards
the
inner
apartments
followed
by
nekhludoff
in
the
third
a
lofty
room
papered
with
white
and
lit
up
by
a
shaded
lamp
stood
two
small
cots
and
a
nurse
with
a
white
cape
on
her
shoulders
sat
between
the
cots
she
had
a
kindly
true
siberian
face
with
its
high
cheekbones
the
nurse
rose
and
bowed
the
mother
stooped
over
the
first
cot
in
which
a
twoyearold
little
girl
lay
peacefully
sleeping
with
her
little
mouth
open
and
her
long
curly
hair
tumbled
over
the
pillow
this
is
katie
said
the
mother
straightening
the
white
and
blue
crochet
coverlet
from
under
which
a
little
white
foot
pushed
itself
languidly
out

not
pretty

only
two
years
old

this
is

calls
him
quite
a
different
type

siberian
is
he
not
a
splendid
boy
said
nekhludoff
as
he
looked
at
the
little
fatty
lying
asleep
on
his
stomach
yes
said
the
mother
with
a
smile
full
of
meaning
nekhludoff
recalled
to
his
mind
chains
shaved
heads
fighting
debauchery
the
dying
kryltzoff
katusha
and
the
whole
of
her
past
and
he
began
to
feel
envious
and
to
wish
for
what
he
saw
here
which
now
seemed
to
him
pure
and
refined
happiness
after
having
repeatedly
expressed
his
admiration
of
the
children
thereby
at
least
partially
satisfying
their
mother
who
eagerly
drank
in
this
praise
he
followed
her
back
to
the
drawingroom
where
the
englishman
was
waiting
for
him
to
go
and
visit
the
prison
as
they
had
arranged
having
taken
leave
of
their
hosts
the
old
and
the
young
ones
the
englishman
and
nekhludoff
went
out
into

of
the
generals
house
the
weather
had
changed
it
was
snowing
and
the
snow
fell
densely
in
large
flakes
and
already
covered
the

the

and
the
trees
in
the
garden

the

the

had
a
trap
of
his
own
and
nekhludoff
having
told
the
coachman
to
drive
to
the
prison
called
his
isvostchik
and
got
in
with
the
heavy
sense
of
having
to
fulfil
an
unpleasant
duty
and
followed
the
englishman
over
the
soft
snow
through
which
the
wheels
turned
with
difficulty

the
dismal
prison
house
with
its
sentinel
and
lamp
burning
under
the
gateway
produced
an
even
more
dismal
impression
with
its
long
row
of
lighted
windows
than
it
had
done
in
the
morning
in
spite
of
the
white
covering
that
now
lay
over
everythingthe
porch
the
roof
and
the
walls
the
imposing
inspector
came
up
to
the
gate
and
read
the
pass
that
had
been
given
to
nekhludoff
and
the
englishman
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
shrugged
his
fine
shoulders
in
surprise
but
in
obedience
to
the
order
asked
the
visitors
to
follow
him
in
he
led
them
through
the
courtyard
and
then
in
at
a
door
to
the
right
and
up
a
staircase
into
the
office
he
offered
them
a
seat
and
asked
what
he
could
do
for
them
and
when
he
heard
that
nekhludoff
would
like
to
see
maslova
at
once
he
sent
a
jailer
to
fetch
her
then
he
prepared
himself
to
answer
the
questions
which
the
englishman
began
to
put
to
him
nekhludoff
acting
as
interpreter
how
many
persons
is
the
prison
built
to
hold
the
englishman
asked
how
many
are
confined
in
it
how
many
men
how
many
women
children
how
many
sentenced
to
the
mines
how
many
exiles
how
many
sick
persons
nekhludoff
translated
the
englishmans
and
the
inspectors
words
without
paying
any
attention
to
their
meaning
and
felt
an
awkwardness
he
had
not
in
the
least
expected
at
the
thought
of
the
impending
interview
when
in
the
midst
of
a
sentence
he
was
translating
for
the
englishman
he
heard
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
and
the
office
door
opened
and
as
had
happened
many
times
before
a
jailer
came
in
followed
by
katusha
and
he
saw
her
with
a
kerchief
tied
round
her
head
and
in
a
prison
jacket

want
a
family
children
i
want
a
human
life
these
thoughts
flashed
through
his
mind
as
she
entered
the
room
with
rapid
steps
and
blinking
her
eyes
he
rose
and
made
a
few
steps
to
meet
her
and
her
face
appeared
hard
and
unpleasant
to
him
it
was
again
as
it
had
been
at
the
time
when
she
reproached
him
she
flushed
and
turned
pale
her
fingers
nervously
twisting
a
corner
of
her
jacket
she
looked
up
at
him
then
cast
down
her
eyes
you
know
that
a
mitigation
has
come
yes
the
jailer
told
me
so
that
as
soon
as
the
original
document
arrives
you
may
come
away
and
settle
where
you
like
we
shall
consider
she
interrupted
him
hurriedly
what
have
i
to
consider
where
valdemar
simonson
goes
there
i
shall
follow
in
spite
of
the
excitement
she
was
in
she
raised
her
eyes
to
nekhludoffs
and
pronounced
these
words
quickly
and
distinctly
as
if
she
had
prepared
what
she
had
to
say
indeed
well
dmitri
ivanovitch
you
see
he
wishes
me
to
live
with
him
and
she
stopped
quite
frightened
and
corrected
herself
he
wishes
me
to
be
near
him
what
more
can
i
desire
i
must
look
upon
it
as
happiness
what
else
is
there
for
me
one
of
two
things
thought
he
either
she
loves
simonson
and
does
not
in
the
least
require
the
sacrifice
i
imagined
i
was
bringing
her
or
she
still
loves
me
and
refuses
me
for
my
own
sake
and
is
burning
her
ships
by
uniting
her
fate
with
simonson
and
nekhludoff
felt
ashamed
and
knew
that
he
was
blushing
and
you
yourself
do
you
love
him
he
asked
loving
or
not
loving
what
does
it
matter
i
have
given
up
all
that
and
then
valdemar
simonson
is
quite
an
exceptional
man
yes
of
course
nekhludoff
began
he
is
a
splendid
man
and
i
think
but
she
again
interrupted
him
as
if
afraid
that
he
might
say
too
much
or
that
she
should
not
say
all
no
dmitri
ivanovitch
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
am
not
doing
what
you
wish
and
she
looked
at
him
with
those
unfathomable
squinting
eyes
of
hers
yes
it
evidently
must
be
so
you
must
live
too
she
said
just
what
he
had
been
telling
himself
a
few
moments
before
but
he
no
longer
thought
so
now
and
felt
very
differently
he
was
not
only
ashamed
but
felt
sorry
to
lose
all
he
was
losing
with
her
i
did
not
expect
this
he
said
why
should
you
live
here
and
suffer
you
have
suffered
enough
i
have
not
suffered
it
was
good
for
me
and
i
should
like
to
go
on
serving
you
if
i
could
we
do
not
want
anything
she
said
and
looked
at
him
you
have
done
so
much
for
me
as
it
is
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
she
wished
to
say
more
but
her
voice
trembled
you
certainly
have
no
reason
to
thank
me
nekhludoff
said
where
is
the
use
of
our
reckoning
god
will
make
up
our
accounts
she
said
and
her
black
eyes
began
to
glisten
with
the
tears
that
filled
them
what
a
good
woman
you
are
he
said
i
good
she
said
through
her
tears
and
a
pathetic
smile
lit
up
her
face
are
you
ready
the
englishman
asked
directly
replied
nekhludoff
and
asked
her
about
kryltzoff
she
got
over
her
emotion
and
quietly
told
him
all
she
knew
kryltzoff
was
very
weak
and
had
been
sent
into
the
infirmary
mary
pavlovna
was
very
anxious
and
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
the
infirmary
as
a
nurse
but
could
not
get
the
permission
am
i
to
go
she
asked
noticing
that
the
englishman
was
waiting
i
will
not
say
goodbye
i
shall
see
you
again
said
nekhludoff
holding
out
his
hand
forgive
me
she
said
so
low
that
he
could
hardly
hear
her
their
eyes
met
and
nekhludoff
knew
by
the
strange
look
of
her
squinting
eyes
and
the
pathetic
smile
with
which
she
said
not
goodbye
but
forgive
me
that
of
the
two
reasons
that
might
have
led
to
her
resolution
the
second
was
the
real
one
she
loved
him
and
thought
that
by
uniting
herself
to
him
she
would
be
spoiling
his
life
by
going
with
simonson
she
thought
she
would
be
setting
nekhludoff
free
and
felt
glad
that
she
had
done
what
she
meant
to
do
and
yet
she
suffered
at
parting
from
him
she
pressed
his
hand
turned
quickly
and
left
the
room
nekhludoff
was
ready
to
go
but
saw
that
the
englishman
was
noting
something
down
and
did
not
disturb
him
but
sat
down
on
a
wooden
seat
by
the
wall
and
suddenly
a
feeling
of
terrible
weariness
came
over
him
it
was
not
a
sleepless
night
that
had
tired
him
not
the
journey
not
the
excitement
but
he
felt
terribly
tired
of
living
he
leaned
against
the
back
of
the
bench
shut
his
eyes
and
in
a
moment
fell
into
a
deep
heavy
sleep
well
would
you
like
to
look
round
the
cells
now
the
inspector
asked
nekhludoff
looked
up
and
was
surprised
to
find
himself
where
he
was
the
englishman
had
finished
his
notes
and
expressed
a
wish
to
see
the
cells
nekhludoff
tired
and
indifferent
followed
him
chapter
xxvi
the
english
visitor
when
they
had
passed
the
anteroom
and
the
sickening
stinking
corridor
the
englishman
and
nekhludoff
accompanied
by
the
inspector
entered
the
first
cell
where
those
sentenced
to
hard
labour
were
confined
the
beds
took
up
the
middle
of
the
cell
and
the
prisoners
were
all
in
bed
there
were
about
70
of
them
when
the
visitors
entered
all
the
prisoners
jumped
up
and
stood
beside
the
beds
excepting
two
a
young
man
who
was
in
a
state
of
high
fever
and
an
old
man
who
did
nothing
but
groan
the
englishman
asked
if
the
young
man
had
long
been
ill
the
inspector
said
that
he
was
taken
ill
in
the
morning
but
that
the
old
man
had
long
been
suffering
with
pains
in
the
stomach
but
could
not
be
removed
as
the
infirmary
had
been
overfilled
for
a
long
time
the
englishman
shook
his
head
disapprovingly
said
he
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
to
these
people
asking
nekhludoff
to
interpret
it
turned
out
that
besides
studying
the
places
of
exile
and
the
prisons
of
siberia
the
englishman
had
another
object
in
view
that
of
preaching
salvation
through
faith
and
by
the
redemption
tell
them
he
said
that
christ
died
for
them
if
they
believe
in
this
they
shall
be
saved
while
he
spoke
all
the
prisoners
stood
silent
with
their
arms
at
their
sides
this
book
tell
them
he
continued
says
all
about
it
can
any
of
them
read
there
were
more
than
20
who
could
the
englishman
took
several
bound
testaments
out
of
a
hangbag
and
many
strong
hands
with
their
hard
black
nails
stretched
out
from
beneath
the
coarse
shirtsleeves
towards
him
he
gave
away
two
testaments
in
this
cell
the
same
thing
happened
in
the
second
cell
there
was
the
same
foul
air
the
same
icon
hanging
between
the
windows
the
same
tub
to
the
left
of
the
door
and
they
were
all
lying
side
by
side
close
to
one
another
and
jumped
up
in
the
same
manner
and
stood
stretched
full
length
with
their
arms
by
their
sides
all
but
three
two
of
whom
sat
up
and
one
remained
lying
and
did
not
even
look
at
the
newcomers
these
three
were
also
ill
the
englishman
made
the
same
speech
and
again
gave
away
two
books
in
the
third
room
four
were
ill
when
the
englishman
asked
why
the
sick
were
not
put
all
together
into
one
cell
the
inspector
said
that
they
did
not
wish
it
themselves
that
their
diseases
were
not
infectious
and
that
the
medical
assistant
watched
them
and
attended
to
them
he
has
not
set
foot
here
for
a
fortnight
muttered
a
voice
the
inspector
did
not
say
anything
and
led
the
way
to
the
next
cell
again
the
door
was
unlocked
and
all
got
up
and
stood
silent
again
the
englishman
gave
away
testaments
it
was
the
same
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
cells
in
those
to
the
right
and
those
to
the
left
from
those
sentenced
to
hard
labour
they
went
on
to
the
exiles
from
the
exiles
to
those
evicted
by
the
commune
and
those
who
followed
of
their
own
free
will
everywhere
men
cold
hungry
idle
infected
degraded
imprisoned
were
shown
off
like
wild
beasts
the
englishman
having
given
away
the
appointed
number
of
testaments
stopped
giving
any
more
and
made
no
speeches
the
oppressing
sight
and
especially
the
stifling
atmosphere
quelled
even
his
energy
and
he
went
from
cell
to
cell
saying
nothing
but
all
right
to
the
inspectors
remarks
about
what
prisoners
there
were
in
each
cell
nekhludoff
followed
as
in
a
dream
unable
either
to
refuse
to
go
on
or
to
go
away
and
with
the
same
feelings
of
weariness
and
hopelessness
chapter
xxvii
kryltzoff
at
rest
in
one
of
the
exiles
cells
nekhludoff
to
his
surprise
recognised
the
strange
old
man
he
had
seen
crossing
the
ferry
that
morning
this
old
man
was
sitting
on
the
floor
by
the
beds
barefooted
with
only
a
dirty
cindercoloured
shirt
on
torn
on
one
shoulder
and
similar
trousers
he
looked
severely
and
enquiringly
at
the
newcomers
his
emaciated
body
visible
through
the
holes
of
his
shirt
looked
miserably
weak
but
in
his
face
was
even
more
concentrated
seriousness
and
animation
than
when
nekhludoff
saw
him
crossing
the
ferry
as
in
all
the
other
cells
so
here
also
the
prisoners
jumped
up
and
stood
erect
when
the
official
entered
but
the
old
man
remained
sitting
his
eyes
glittered
and
his
brows
frowned
with
wrath
get
up
the
inspector
called
out
to
him
the
old
man
did
not
rise
and
only
smiled
contemptuously
thy
servants
are
standing
before
thee
i
am
not
thy
servant
thou
bearest
the
seal
the
old
man
pointed
to
the
inspectors
forehead
whaat
said
the
inspector
threateningly
and
made
a
step
towards
him
i
know
this
man
nekhludoff
hastened
to
say
what
is
he
imprisoned
for
the
police
have
sent
him
here
because
he
has
no
passport
we
ask
them
not
to
send
such
but
they
will
do
it
said
the
inspector
casting
an
angry
side
look
at
the
old
man
and
so
it
seems
thou
too
art
one
of
antichrists
army
the
old
man
said
to
nekhludoff
no
i
am
a
visitor
said
nekhludoff
what
hast
thou
come
to
see
how
antichrist
tortures
men
there
look
he
has
locked
them
up
in
a
cage
a
whole
army
of
them
men
should
eat
bread
in
the
sweat
of
their
brow
and
he
has
locked
them
up
with
no
work
to
do
and
feeds
them
like
swine
so
that
they
should
turn
into
beasts
what
is
he
saying
asked
the
englishman
nekhludoff
told
him
the
old
man
was
blaming
the
inspector
for
keeping
men
imprisoned
ask
him
how
he
thinks
one
should
treat
those
who
do
not
keep
to
the
laws
said
the
englishman
nekhludoff
translated
the
question
the
old
man
laughed
in
a
strange
manner
showing
his
teeth
the
laws
he
repeated
with
contempt
he
first
robbed
everybody
took
all
the
earth
all
the
rights
away
from
men
killed
all
those
who
were
against
him
and
then
wrote
laws
forbidding
robbery
and
murder
he
should
have
written
these
laws
before
nekhludoff
translated
the
englishman
smiled
well
anyhow
ask
him
how
one
should
treat
thieves
and
murderers
at
present
nekhludoff
again
translated
his
question
tell
him
he
should
take
the
seal
of
antichrist
off
himself
the
old
man
said
frowning
severely
then
there
will
be
no
thieves
and
murderers
tell
him
so
he
is
crazy
said
the
englishman
when
nekhludoff
had
translated
the
old
mans
words
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
left
the
cell
do
thy
business
and
leave
them
alone
every
one
for
himself
god
knows
whom
to

his
own
chief
then
the
chiefs
will
not

he
added
angrily
frowning
and
looking
with
glittering
eyes
at
nekhludoff
who
lingered
in
the
cell
hast
thou
not
looked
on
long
enough
how
the
servants
of
antichrist
feed
lice
on
men
go

when
nekhludoff
went
out
he
saw
the
englishman
standing
by
the
open
door
of
an
empty
cell
with
the
inspector
asking
what
the
cell
was
for
the
inspector
explained
that
it
was
the
mortuary
oh
said
the
englishman
when
nekhludoff
had
translated
and
expressed
the
wish
to
go
in
the
mortuary
was
an
ordinary
cell
not
very
large
a
small
lamp
hung
on
the
wall
and
dimly
lit
up
sacks
and
logs
of
wood
that
were
piled
up
in
one
corner
and
four
dead
bodies
lay
on
the
bedshelves
to
the
right
the
first
body
had
a
coarse
linen
shirt
and
trousers
on
it
was
that
of
a
tall
man
with
a
small
beard
and
half
his
head
shaved
the
body
was
quite
rigid
the
bluish
hands
that
had
evidently
been
folded
on
the
breast
had
separated
the
legs
were
also
apart
and
the
bare
feet
were
sticking
out
next
to
him
lay
a
barefooted
old
woman
in
a
white
petticoat
her
head
with
its
thin
plait
of
hair
uncovered
with
a
little
pinched
yellow
face
and
a
sharp
nose
beyond
her
was
another
man
with
something
lilac
on
this
colour
reminded
nekhludoff
of
something
he
came
nearer
and
looked
at
the
body
the
small
pointed
beard
sticking
upwards
the
firm
wellshaped
nose
the
high
white
forehead
the
thin
curly
hair
he
recognised
the
familiar
features
and
could
hardly
believe
his
eyes
yesterday
he
had
seen
this
face
angry
excited
and
full
of
suffering
now
it
was
quiet
motionless
and
terribly
beautiful
yes
it
was
kryltzoff
or
at
any
rate
the
trace
that
his
material
existence
had
left
behind
why
had
he
suffered
why
had
he
lived
does
he
now
understand
nekhludoff
thought
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
answer
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
death
and
he
felt
faint
without
taking
leave
of
the
englishman
nekhludoff
asked
the
inspector
to
lead
him
out
into
the
yard
and
feeling
the
absolute
necessity
of
being
alone
to
think
over
all
that
had
happened
that
evening
he
drove
back
to
his
hotel

a
new
life
dawns
for
nekhludoff
nekhludoff
did
not
go
to
bed
but
went
up
and
down
his
room
for
a
long
time
his
business
with
katusha
was
at
an
end
he
was
not
wanted
and
this
made
him
sad
and
ashamed
his
other
business
was
not
only
unfinished
but
troubled
him
more
than
ever
and
demanded
his
activity
all
this
horrible
evil
that
he
had
seen
and
learned
to
know
lately
and
especially
today
in
that
awful
prison
this
evil
which
had
killed
that
dear
kryltzoff
ruled
and
was
triumphant
and
he
could
foreseen
possibility
of
conquering
or
even
knowing
how
to
conquer
it
those
hundreds
and
thousands
of
degraded
human
beings
locked
up
in
the
noisome
prisons
by
indifferent
generals
procureurs
inspectors
rose
up
in
his
imagination
he
remembered
the
strange
free
old
man
accusing
the
officials
and
therefore
considered
mad
and
among
the
corpses
the
beautiful
waxen
face
of
kryltzoff
who
had
died
in
anger
and
again
the
question
as
to
whether
he
was
mad
or
those
who
considered
they
were
in
their
right
minds
while
they
committed
all
these
deeds
stood
before
him
with
renewed
force
and
demanded
an
answer
tired
of
pacing
up
and
down
tired
of
thinking
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
near
the
lamp
and
mechanically
opened
the
testament
which
the
englishman
had
given
him
as
a
remembrance
and
which
he
had
thrown
on
the
table
when
he
emptied
his
pockets
on
coming
in
it
is
said
one
can
find
an
answer
to
everything
here
he
thought
and
opened
the
testament
at
random
and
began
reading
matt

in
that
hour
came
the
disciples
unto
jesus
saying
who
then
is
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
he
called
to
him
a
little
child
and
set
him
in
the
midst
of
them
and
said
verily
i
say
unto
you
except
ye
turn
and
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
in
nowise
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
whosoever
therefore
shall
humble
himself
as
this
little
child
the
same
is
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
yes
yes
that
is
true
he
said
remembering
that
he
had
known
the
peace
and
joy
of
life
only
when
he
had
humbled
himself
and
whosoever
shall
receive
one
such
little
child
in
my
name
receiveth
me
but
whoso
shall
cause
one
of
these
little
ones
to
stumble
it
is
more
profitable
for
him
that
a
great
millstone
should
be
hanged
about
his
neck
and
that
he
should
be
sunk
in
the
depths
of
the
sea

what
is
this
for
whosoever
shall
receive
receive
where
and
what
does
in
my
name
mean
he
asked
feeling
that
these
words
did
not
tell
him
anything
and
why
the
millstone
round
his
neck
and
the
depths
of
the
sea
no
that
is
not
it
it
is
not
clear
and
he
remembered
how
more
than
once
in
his
life
he
had
taken
to
reading
the
gospels
and
how
want
of
clearness
in
these
passages
had
repulsed
him
he
went
on
to
read
the
seventh
eighth
ninth
and
tenth
verses
about
the
occasions
of
stumbling
and
that
they
must
come
and
about
punishment
by
casting
men
into
hell
fire
and
some
kind
of
angels
who
see
the
face
of
the
father
in
heaven
what
a
pity
that
this
is
so
incoherent
he
thought
yet
one
feels
that
there
is
something
good
in
it
for
the
son
of
man
came
to
save
that
which
was
lost
he
continued
to
read
how
think
ye
if
any
man
have
a
hundred
sheep
and
one
of
them
go
astray
doth
he
not
leave
the
ninety
and
nine
and
go
into
the
mountains
and
seek
that
which
goeth
astray
and
if
so
be
that
he
find
it
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
rejoiceth
over
it
more
than
over
the
ninety
and
nine
which
have
not
gone
astray
even
so
it
is
not
the
will
of
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
that
one
of
these
little
ones
should
perish
yes
it
is
not
the
will
of
the
father
that
they
should
perish
and
here
they
are
perishing
by
hundreds
and
thousands
and
there
is
no
possibility
of
saving
them
he
thought
then
came
peter
and
said
to
him
how
oft
shall
my
brother
offend
me
and
i
forgive
him
until
seven
times
jesus
saith
unto
him
i
say
not
unto
thee
until
seven
times
but
until
seventy
times
seven
therefore
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
likened
unto
a
certain
king
which
made
a
reckoning
with
his
servants
and
when
he
had
begun
to
reckon
one
was
brought
unto
him
which
owed
him
ten
thousand
talents
but
forasmuch
as
he
had
not
wherewith
to
pay
his
lord
commanded
him
to
be
sold
and
his
wife
and
children
and
all
that
he
had
and
payment
to
be
made
the
servant
therefore
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
saying
lord
have
patience
with
me
i
will
pay
thee
all
and
the
lord
of
that
servant
being
moved
with
compassion
released
him
and
forgave
him
the
debt
but
that
servant
went
out
and
found
one
of
his
fellowservants
which
owed
him
a
hundred
pence
and
he
laid
hold
on
him
and
took
him
by
the
throat
saying
pay
what
thou
owest
so
his
fellowservant
fell
down
and
besought
him
saying
have
patience
with
me
and
i
will
pay
thee
and
he
would
not
but
went
and
cast
him
into
prison
till
he
should
pay
that
which
was
due
so
when
his
fellowservants
saw
what
was
done
they
were
exceeding
sorry
and
came
and
told
unto
their
lord
all
that
was
done
then
his
lord
called
him
unto
him
and
saith
to
him
thou
wicked
servant
i
forgave
thee
all
that
debt
because
thou
besought
me
shouldst
not
thou
also
have
mercy
on
thy
fellowservant
as
i
had
mercy
on
thee
and
is
this
all
nekhludoff
suddenly
exclaimed
aloud
and
the
inner
voice
of
the
whole
of
his
being
said
yes
it
is
all
and
it
happened
to
nekhludoff
as
it
often
happens
to
men
who
are
living
a
spiritual
life
the
thought
that
seemed
strange
at
first
and
paradoxical
or
even
to
be
only
a
joke
being
confirmed
more
and
more
often
by
lifes
experience
suddenly
appeared
as
the
simplest
truest
certainty
in
this
way
the
idea
that
the
only
certain
means
of
salvation
from
the
terrible
evil
from
which
men
were
suffering
was
that
they
should
always
acknowledge
themselves
to
be
sinning
against
god
and
therefore
unable
to
punish
or
correct
others
because
they
were
dear
to
him
it
became
clear
to
him
that
all
the
dreadful
evil
he
had
been
witnessing
in
prisons
and
jails
and
the
quiet
selfsatisfaction
of
the
perpetrators
of
this
evil
were
the
consequences
of
men
trying
to
do
what
was
impossible
trying
to
correct
evil
while
being
evil
themselves
vicious
men
were
trying
to
correct
other
vicious
men
and
thought
they
could
do
it
by
using
mechanical
means
and
the
only
consequence
of
all
this
was
that
the
needs
and
the
cupidity
of
some
men
induced
them
to
take
up
this
socalled
punishment
and
correction
as
a
profession
and
have
themselves
become
utterly
corrupt
and
go
on
unceasingly
depraving
those
whom
they
torment
now
he
saw
clearly
what
all
the
terrors
he
had
seen
came
from
and
what
ought
to
be
done
to
put
a
stop
to
them
the
answer
he
could
not
find
was
the
same
that
christ
gave
to
peter
it
was
that
we
should
forgive
always
an
infinite
number
of
times
because
there
are
no
men
who
have
not
sinned
themselves
and
therefore
none
can
punish
or
correct
others
but
surely
it
cannot
be
so
simple
thought
nekhludoff
and
yet
he
saw
with
certainty
strange
as
it
had
seemed
at
first
that
it
was
not
only
a
theoretical
but
also
a
practical
solution
of
the
question
the
usual
objection
what
is
one
to
do
with
the
evil
doers
surely
not
let
them
go
unpunished
no
longer
confused
him
this
objection
might
have
a
meaning
if
it
were
proved
that
punishment
lessened
crime
or
improved
the
criminal
but
when
the
contrary
was
proved
and
it
was
evident
that
it
was
not
in
peoples
power
to
correct
each
other
the
only
reasonable
thing
to
do
is
to
leave
off
doing
the
things
which
are
not
only
useless
but
harmful
immoral
and
cruel
for
many
centuries
people
who
were
considered
criminals
have
been
tortured
well
and
have
they
ceased
to
exist
no
their
numbers
have
been
increased
not
alone
by
the
criminals
corrupted
by
punishment
but
also
by
those
lawful
criminals
the
judges
procureurs
magistrates
and
jailers
who
judge
and
punish
men
nekhludoff
now
understood
that
society
and
order
in
general
exists
not
because
of
these
lawful
criminals
who
judge
and
punish
others
but
because
in
spite
of
men
being
thus
depraved
they
still
pity
and
love
one
another
in
hopes
of
finding
a
confirmation
of
this
thought
in
the
gospel
nekhludoff
began
reading
it
from
the
beginning
when
he
had
read
the
sermon
on
the
mount
which
had
always
touched
him
he
saw
in
it
for
the
first
time
today
not
beautiful
abstract
thoughts
setting
forth
for
the
most
part
exaggerated
and
impossible
demands
but
simple
clear
practical
laws
if
these
laws
were
carried
out
in
practice
and
this
was
quite
possible
they
would
establish
perfectly
new
and
surprising
conditions
of
social
life
in
which
the
violence
that
filled
nekhludoff
with
such
indignation
would
cease
of
itself
not
only
this
but
the
greatest
blessing
that
is
obtainable
to
men
the
kingdom
of
heaven
on
earth
would
be
established
there
were
five
of
these
laws

nekhludoff
sat
staring
at
the
lamp
and
his
heart
stood
still
recalling
the
monstrous
confusion
of
the
life
we
lead
he
distinctly
saw
what
that
life
could
be
if
men
were
brought
up
to
obey
these
rules
and
rapture
such
as
he
had
long
not
felt
filled
his
soul
just
as
if
after
long
days
of
weariness
and
suffering
he
had
suddenly
found
ease
and
freedom
he
did
not
sleep
all
night
and
as
it
happens
to
many
and
many
a
man
who
reads
the
gospels
he
understood
for
the
first
time
the
full
meaning
of
the
words
read
so
often
before
but
passed
by
unnoticed
he
imbibed
all
these
necessary
important
and
joyful
revelations
as
a
sponge
imbibes
water
and
all
he
read
seemed
so
familiar
and
seemed
to
confirm
to
form
into
a
conception
what
he
had
known
long
ago
but
had
never
realised
and
never
quite
believed
now
he
realised
and
believed
it
and
not
only
realised
and
believed
that
if
men
would
obey
these
laws
they
would
obtain
the
highest
blessing
they
can
attain
to
he
also
realised
and
believed
that
the
only
duty
of
every
man
is
to
fulfil
these
laws
that
in
this
lies
the
only
reasonable
meaning
of
life
that
every
stepping
aside
from
these
laws
is
a
mistake
which
is
immediately
followed
by
retribution
this
flowed
from
the
whole
of
the
teaching
and
was
most
strongly
and
clearly
illustrated
in
the
parable
of
the
vineyard
the
husbandman
imagined
that
the
vineyard
in
which
they
were
sent
to
work
for
their
master
was
their
own
that
all
that
was
in
was
made
for
them
and
that
their
business
was
to
enjoy
life
in
this
vineyard
forgetting
the
master
and
killing
all
those
who
reminded
them
of
his
existence
are
we
not
doing
the
same
nekhludoff
thought
when
we
imagine
ourselves
to
be
masters
of
our
lives
and
that
life
is
given
us
for
enjoyment
this
evidently
is
an
incongruity
we
were
sent
here
by
some
ones
will
and
for
some
reason
and
we
have
concluded
that
we
live
only
for
our
own
joy
and
of
course
we
feel
unhappy
as
labourers
do
when
not
fulfilling
their
masters
orders
the
masters
will
is
expressed
in
these
commandments
if
men
will
only
fulfil
these
laws
the
kingdom
of
heaven
will
be
established
on
earth
and
men
will
receive
the
greatest
good
that
they
can
attain
to
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
and
his
righteousness
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
and
so
here
it
is
the
business
of
my
life
scarcely
have
i
finished
one
and
another
has
commenced
and
a
perfectly
new
life
dawned
that
night
for
nekhludoff
not
because
he
had
entered
into
new
conditions
of
life
but
because
everything
he
did
after
that
night
had
a
new
and
quite
different
significance
than
before
how
this
new
period
of
his
life
will
end
time
alone
will
prove
transcribers

corrected

we

not
doing

we
